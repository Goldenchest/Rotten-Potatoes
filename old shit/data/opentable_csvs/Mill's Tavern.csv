February 27, 2016|Exceptional restaurant|5|Once the initially slow service got rolling, everything was great -- atmosphere, food, wine, and service. Exceptional.
February 27, 2016|Love this place!|5|Every meal is a delight, setting is lovely, waitstaff is attentive and winelist/cocktails excel! I love the salads, steaks and special entrees and have never had a bad meal. The waitstaff is well-versed on the menu and offer excellent suggestions that they only give after asking what you're looking for....nothing rote. Not cheap but excellent value for the experience you get!
February 20, 2016|Duck to die for|5|I loved the duck with its four preparations including an egg. My companion thought the filet was perfect (he likes his meat rare) perhaps one of the best he has had. Did I mention the very fresh clams on the half shell: a perfect beginning.
February 17, 2016|Gourmet Food at Special Value|5|Every Food item in their Special Value Pre Fixe Menu was delicious and extra wonderful.
February 17, 2016|See Below|2|See below as I do not want my concerns to be in the public domain
February 14, 2016|Fantastic Valentine's Dinner|4|My husband and I were seated at a cozy table for two for dinner. The sparkling water and our cocktail/wine took a bit of time to get to us, but the waiter was friendly and knowledgable about the special menu and vegetarian options for my husband. The food was prepared expertly and the drinks were outstanding. I enjoyed the Down Island cocktail and a baked stuffed lobster. The accompanying green beans and fingerling potatoes were the best I have had in a while - cooked and seasoned perfectly. My husband loved the tomato soup and gnocchi. We were mistakenly brought bread and entrees after we had eaten our meals - they were for another table. Valentine's weekend can be tough on servers though - I used to waitress and understand. I would certainly go back for dinner again.
February 14, 2016|Valentines dinner|4|Glad to have made a reservation through Open Table. Valet parking, coats were taken by the host. We were seated promptly on arrival. Staff was warm and friendly. The food was excellent, the duck breastfeeding and grilled swordfish were excellent. Was hoping for Sakonnet Oysters, but they didn't carry that local faire. Overall excellent meal and services!
February 14, 2016|I was looking forward to this evening. I...|3|I was looking forward to this evening. I took my family for a dinner. We ordered risotto, beef short rib, pork chop, tomatoes bisque, sea food plate, desert for all of us. I had very high expectations. Only pork chops and bread pudding was worth of money. I am sorry to say this, but i paid over $200, and it was not worth it. I wish I went elsewhere. Maybe it was not the right day, or right choice of food, but... 3 of my friends asked me if i would recommend this place, and I said NO.
February 14, 2016|Careful of your Steak order|5|Ordered 2 Filets, med-rare, both came out well. Was Valentines, so we ate them anyway. Tasty..but I like then NOT well done. Didn't complain, it took a while to get them to begin with. But overall, I would go back...I would just be more specific about what med-well is.
February 13, 2016|Great food, good service|4|Everything we saw in the restaurant looked exceptional, and what we ended up ordering didn't disappoint. The short rib was outstanding, and the sides with both of our entrees were surprisingly complex. My only complaint was that the waiter did not give us much guidance with our choices, telling us everything was delicious, and was a bit unfamiliar with the wine list. Will definitely go back.
February 12, 2016|Great steak|4|This was our second visit to Mills Tavern and based on our first, outstanding visit, this one was a little underwhelming. Our server was excellent, the filet mignon was incredible, cooked perfectly with a delicious glaze. The issue was the appetizer (escargot) and our sides (brussel sprouts and mac & cheese) were all missing much taste. Adding salt at the table brought out the taste a little better, but they were all a bit bland. On our first visit, everything was incredible, from beginning to end. This time, we were just disappointed by those items. The filet though is only rivaled by Capital Grille.
February 11, 2016|Great place|5|The food and ambience was outstanding as usual . Unfortunately I never got the servers name but he was great !!!

February 6, 2016|Mills Tavers|4|Everything was very good. The lighting in the area, a corner booth by a front window, of our table for 5 was too low. In fact a person at an adjacent table used her phone for additional lighting. The service was vey good, attentive without being intrusive. The food presentation was lovely; all plates were warm and the food temperature perfect.
February 2, 2016|Great Service|5|Always great. We try to get here at least every other month. It never disappoints. Reservation special requests are always granted and the wait staff is always on point.
January 30, 2016|Short Ribs to die for.  Shrimp cocktail supreme.|3|Food was excellent. Service was poor. The restaurant was not that crowded. Seated in a timely manner. After seating we found the waiter with a bundle of Attitude.
January 30, 2016|Very consistent...Very good|5|MT is on our rotation of favorite Providence restaurants. Very nice atmosphere, consistently good food and excellent service are characteristic of this restaurant. My wife and I both had the short ribs, one of the house specialties, and a long time fave of ours. Very tender and great tasting...can't go wrong. MT is pricey but worth it...highly recommend...

January 22, 2016|Placing an Order|3|Couple of suggestions ... provide an option for salad dressing on the side, some of us prefer to limit the amount of dressing, and definitely, definitely don't give the customer a hard time regarding the request. Find a way to address whatever concern you may have about bringing it on the side without embarrassing the customer. If the customer asks for no onions, note that shallots are a type of onion and should also be removed. Next, if a customer orders a desert, bring it to the table. I suppose it's a nice touch, automated calorie control. On the bright side, my son loved his Australian steak. Best he's ever had! Could have eaten another, it was that good. The rest of the meals we're OK, for the price.
January 22, 2016|JG / MH dining experience.|5|"We had 3 experiences with Mills Tavern. 1st was just 2 of us. We ordered a steak, and we were not fond of the smoked flavor. 2nd visit was with another couple, and it was pointed out to us that we had chosen from the ""wood oven"" (ruh roh). We paid attention this time. I ordered fish, 2 ordered rack of lamb, 4th ordered short ribs... Needless to say meals were delicious, service was great. We returned again by ourselves, 1 ordered Alaskan Salmon, and I ordered the delicious short ribs. It was very good. You will be seeing more of us in the near future. I would recommend anyone to Mills Tavern. (We never order any alcoholic beverages when we are by ourselves). The wine menu is very good."
January 20, 2016|A Favorite!|5|Mills Tavern is one of my favorite restaurants in Providence. I have dined here many times before but I still decided to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu. Everything was fantastic and it is always a pleasure to have James as a server. I also work in the Providence restaurant scene and always list Mills as a personal favorite!
January 17, 2016|Restaurant weeks|5|Went here on a snowy Sunday night and started with the King crab wasabi Appetizer which was out of this world. We then proceeded to the main course which I got the 10 ounce filet with grilled asparagus once again it was amazing. So far this is one of our favorites out of the 6 different restaurants we have tried during restaurant week in Rhode Island.
January 16, 2016|Another great meal.|5|We loved our dinner at Mill's Tavern...in some ways it was almost TOO good. We both ordered salads and the portions were generous; we could have split one. Both were fantastic. Both of our entrees were rich and delicious, but also a little bit heavy and we would have been satisfied with smaller portions. Based on portion-size I would say the value is GREAT but I might prefer smaller portions and slightly lower prices. Either way though I think the pricing is fair. Ambiance was fun and perfect for a date night and the service was impeccable. Would definitely go back!
January 16, 2016|Amazing food|5|From the moment we sat down we knew we picked the right place. The food was incredible, the service was top notch, and the experience awesome
January 15, 2016|Providence Resturant  Week 2016|5|We booked reservations at Mill's Tavern for the 2016 Providence Resturant Week. Being a native Rhode Islander and having gone to college on the East Side, I can say that this was one of the best dining experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time. Not only was the staff professional and welcoming, but the restaurant itself was warm and ambient; perfect on a cold winter's night. Having been seated at the bar as we waited for our table, we were overwhelmed with the selection of liquor, especially international favorites, like Dominican rum, which I love. Not only was the Resturant week menu reflective of the winter season, but it catered to all eating tastes, especially to a foodie like myself. My boyfriend and I agreed that this was one of the best meals that we've ever had. We strongly reccomended Mill's to all family and friends. We cannot wait to go back!

January 10, 2016|Restaurant week menu not available|2|My husband and I were there for the restaurant week menu. The restaurant week menu offers Wagu skirt steak, however, the waitress said that they did not receive the shipment, therefore, they just removed the item from the restaurant week menu. She did not offer any substitute for other steak. My husband was very disappointed, it ended up he has to order from the al la carte menu.
January 2, 2016|Slow|3|restaurant was not busy when we arrived, but it took over an hour to be served our main course. tables very close together which I did not find relaxing having to hear two other couples conversations beside us, hard to tune it out. wait staff said kitchen was slow but other table were finished their entree before we were even served ours and they were seated a good twenty minutes after us.
December 30, 2015|Always reliably good|4|Fine food, well served, sophisticated and diverse menu, valet parking. A lovely evening.
December 24, 2015|Christmas Eve Tradition|5|I have dined many times at Mills throughout the year but Christmas Eve dinner has become a tradition and this year did not disappoint. From the food to the service, everything was top notch. James is always a delight! Highly recommended!
December 24, 2015|Christmas Eve|5|My family and I went here on Xmas eve both food and service was outstanding.
December 19, 2015|Best Steaks in Rhode Island grilled over hardwood|5|"Our waiter James was fantastic and the drinks came readily even with a full house. The wine list is not the cheapest but has some notable stand outs such as the Traviglinni Gatinara and the bourbon and chartreuse cocktail was superb. You really can not go wrong with the seasonal foie-gras appetizers or the sweet breads but even the simple Cesar is executed perfectly. After over half a dozen trips here this year for steaks (filet, rib-eye or aged strip) have all been cooked to a perfect and true medium rare and you can't beat the half order risotto specials as a side to sub out the normal but delicious potato or veg. There are some talented chefs in this kitchen and in our dinning groups opinion this is an extremely undervalued and over looked place for high end intelligently prepared and plated food. When I am craving Persimmon but can't get to Bristol I come here because I know they will never disappoint even the most ""foodie"" or Know it all type of dinners as well as someone who just wants their rib-eye and mashed. One of my few 5 star rating places. Also I have put reservations in through open table and old fashioned phone call and they always get the reservation correct both ways. Good from the front of the house to back!"

December 12, 2015|Fabulous Experience|5|Went for dinner last Saturday night with my husband, Aunt and Uncle, all of which are distinguished foodies. I was in charge of picking the restaurant, tall order in our family. Each of us were impressed. The wine list was broad as were the food selections, and the atmosphere (starting with the bar) was sophisticated but friendly. There were so many great sounding meal choices, I went with the waitress suggestion and had the Soy Brined Pork Chop which I wouldn't normally have ordered. The dish wowed us all when it showed up, and the taste owned up to the presentation. My husband had the Braised Short Ribs which he raved about through the next day. My Aunt loved her salmon (not crazy about the way her brussel sprouts were dressed - vinegar) and my Uncle who is especially distinguished went for the Rack of Lamb which he said was excellent. We shared the Adffogato...to die for. We all agreed that we will be back.
December 12, 2015|Will certainly go there again; overall it is great|5|Had the lamb chops my friend had the filet, both were outstanding. Sat at the bar, server was fun and helpful

December 4, 2015|Four Good Years|4|As the parent of a local college student, we have enjoyed our annual visits to the college - and to Mills Tavern. While we have tried many good restaurants in Prividence, including the better known Al Forno, Mills has become our go-to restaurant. The menu includes a good mix of flavorful, typically meat, dishes with lighter fare. From the football player to the oboist, all of our guests seem to find something they enjoyed. We also appreciated the ambiance and service - top notch professional but warm and inviting.
Dined on December 4, 2015|Table are too close|2|Great food, great service, but the tables for two are packed too close together. The food would easily be worth the $$$ price, IF we weren't packed in like sardines.
November 28, 2015|Great meal!|4|Have been here several times, and it was a wonderful find. Great , friendly service,a wonderful wine list and cozy atmosphere are all a plus. Albeit expensive, it is my go to place for a special dinner when in Providence as it is quietly located on College Hill and away from Federal Hill. Valet parking is key as well . I live on the outer Cape and drive to Providence quite often to pick up relatives at train.
November 27, 2015|This is the second time we have eaten here. Great.|5|The food was good but my Daughters swordfish was way overcooked. The Lamb, Duck excellent. The salads the best I've ever had. The atmosphere is friendly, welcoming.
November 26, 2015|Kate|5|"Fabulous holiday dinner! It was such a delight to be in a warm and gracious setting for the holiday. As always, the service was great and the food was ""out of this world""!"
November 23, 2015|We had a great time.|5|Our server was only outshined by the quality of the kitchen. Perfect all around.

November 21, 2015|Great spot for catching up!|5|Two college friends and I got together at Mills Tavern last weekend, and had a great time. The menu was interesting, the wine lovely, and the food delicious. Highly recommend!
November 16, 2015|Great dinner|4|Overall great experience. Table was ready upon arrival. Liked the drink list and how they were all the same price that way you can choose based on your preference and not the price, although I chose wine anyway. Love the constantly changing menu for a new experience each time. Had little necks and the pizza for an app. Little necks were cooked perfectly and the crostini was delicious to soak up the sauce. Pizza was slightly undercooked but otherwise nice fall flavors. Was pretty committed to the gnocchi before even looking at the menus because they were so great last time. Love how they are soft and light yet the light frying they get after gives it a nice crunch. Very unique for a pasta dish, flavors went well together although I found there to be too much Brie. I love cheese but it made the dish almost too rich even though the apples and such balanced it. Made my sister get the duck just so I could have some. Breast was cooked perfectly. The salty duck and sweet grapes paired so well. Liked how the leg was crunchy but it was servely overlooked. Very dry and rock hard. Mom got the pork loin - had to send it back to be cooked more but seemed like it was more her preference than cooked wrong. She did say it was cold when it came out though. Portuguese bread pudding was fantastic. Sweet and delicate yet hearty. Would definitely return for another meal.

November 14, 2015|Great Food, Service, City Priced|5|"Just as the title describes, we were impressed with the food drink and the service but we ended up spending over $100 per person. I do recommend this restaurant however because the many good definitely outweigh the slightly high price. We had a range of food with our group. We had oysters and shrimp cocktail with a cheese platter as well as a squash soup for appetizers and all were excellent. For our entrees we had swordfish, rib eye, salmon and my favorite duck. All were pared well with wines and champagne. They make a great ""Moscow Mule"" though they don't call it that. We were comped a port wine with our dessert and ended with a cappuccino. Will definitely return again."
November 10, 2015|Food just gets better and better|5|I have eaten at Mills Tavern several times during the past few months, and it never disappoints. The food is fabulous and the service is terrific. Their prix fixe menu during the week is very reasonably priced and the food is delicious. I cannot say enough good things about this place. It has become my favorite restaurant in Providence.

November 6, 2015|Enjoyable Meal|4|We found the food and the service to be very good. I did however think it was a bit overpriced.

Food and service were top notch, Our server suggested some of her favorite dishes which we gladly tried and were not disappointed! Lamb chops and short rib were fantastic. She was knowledgable and friendly and gave us complimentary prosecco for our anniversary. Great experience, we will definitely be returning!

October 27, 2015|Enjoyable evening.|5|We always look forward to dining at Mills, because we can count on everything being very good - food, service, atmosphere. Unusually professional waitstaff adds to the enjoyment of the meal. Highly recommended.
October 26, 2015|Quaint Tavern|4|I came in on a week night, solo, while on business. I had made a reservation, but had no problem being seated. This is a quaint tavern in a historical neighborhood. Mainly couples were dining, so it was a quiet, romantic setting. I had the New York strip and asperagas. Great steak, nicely cooked. Good wine list, and the service was great. Best parking is across the street at the paid lot.
October 24, 2015|Another amazing evening|5|Mills Tavern is our go-to restaurant for special occasions! We took a friend who is family here for her birthday dinner. The Caramel Apple Slice cocktails were enjoyed by her and my hubby while I enjoyed the Mexican Pear cocktail! Our server Jason was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and provided super service! The Black Tiger Shrimp at Mills are THE BEST anywhere as are the oysters!! We all enjoyed our Ribeyes and they were all so tender you didn't really need a knife...and desserts were very yummy!! The evening was made even better by finding out that Dana is now onboard as the new manager! Mills is in great hands with Dana and we are even more excited to visit Mills more often!! Can't wait to return!!
October 21, 2015|This time|3|Service was a bit of a problem. Food very nice and especially good venue for a group.

October 17, 2015|Great, but skip the Wagyu|4|We love Mills. The atmosphere is sophisticated, warm and pleasant. Service is excellent. I've never had less than an a great review for this place. I'd usually give them 98 out of 100. This past Saturday, they earned a 90 ..they forgot to bring my wine for 30 minutes) and the Waguy was tough. The cheese platter is amazing and thoughtfully prepared. Cocktails are always excellent and creative. Sides were plentiful and well prepared. Deserts were to die for. I'm still a huge fan, but now I know they're fallible.
October 16, 2015|Great Ambiance, spotty service, OK food|4|My family and I were initially very impressed with the ambiance within this lovely restaurant at the base of College Hill. The menu looked enticing, and the waiter appeared eager when we arrived at 6pm. Unfortunately, our appetizers did not arrive until after 7pm, and we begged to get our dinner before we had to leave at 7:30pm. (We may have been distracted by the surroundings). Appetizers were lovely. We ordered steaks for our main course - just OK (as compared with Flemings, for example). I would go back again, but order something more exotic from the menu, and alert the waiter to our timing. We should not need to wait an hour for the beginning of our meal.
October 10, 2015|fight for your table|4|We arrived early for our 8:15 reservation. Had great glass of wine (but not inexpensive), checked in with front desk who informed me if I wanted a great table at the window, there would be a short wait. Went back to bar where a lone male sat down he was obviously known to the bar keep who was not expecting to see him. Another fellow joined him. Shortly after, the only window table for two was ready but we were not called. The hostess did approach us after a few minutes saying a good table in main diningroom was open. When asked about the window table I had requested she said none were available but the nonwindow table was ready now. I asked what about the window table for 2 that's been ready for a while. She was flustered, went to the front and said it was ours. While I had to push the issue a bit, it was refreshing that we (not regulars) were treated as regulars. It will keep us coming back. The two gentlemen were seated minutes after us.
October 10, 2015|My new favorite for dinner in Providence!|5|We had a party of 5 and everyone said their entree was remarkable. My Atlantic Swordfish was perfectly prepared--melted in my mouth. I recommend the wood roasted asparagus too--very tasty! Warm ambiance is a great description for the restaurant's interior design. The location is great if visiting RISD.
October 10, 2015|Didn't live up to expectations|3|"I guess I didn't select the best items within the menu, but I was very disappointed with the swordfish. It was hugely thick but not hugely flavorful and rather salty - perhaps influenced by the plating with salt roasted beets. The caesar salad was great - crisp and cold. My husband described his lamb chops as ""good."" With the reputation and pricing I expected more satisfying flavors. The aromas are wonderful with the wood grill and oven and perhaps I'd have been happier with something from the grill rather than the oven. The other reaction I had was portion size. It strikes me as over-the-top to serve a 20 oz. piece of meat."
October 8, 2015|Remarkably slow service|1|Second time that the service was slow, however, this was remarkably slow. So slow, in fact, the manager took 50% off the check without us even asking. Wonderful food as always but Mills needs to staff more appropriately. It's a trend of poor service.
October 6, 2015|Our server|5|The atmosphere and food were excellent. Our server Shane made the dining experience exceptional. He knew the menu and knew exactly when to approach our table. He also had a great sense of humor! He is a gem!
October 3, 2015|Mills Tavern|3|this was not my best visit. the halibut w quinoa was small and too sweet. the gnochi tasted like dough. usually much better
September 26, 2015|Fantastic Dining|5|Our evening was wonderful due to the excellent appetizers, the succulent entrees and the decadent dessert. Our server, Lynn, made the experience all the more perfect. Can't wait to go back!

September 19, 2015|We're definitely coming back.|4|My husband and I had dinner at Mill's Tavern on 9/19/15. We had another event to go to after dinner so we didn't have the time to fully sample the menu. We will definitely be back when we have the time to try appetizers and desserts as well as the main entrees. Our sever, Stephen, was knowledgeable about the menu and mildly entertaining but not intrusive. The food was beautifully prepared and delicious. I had the rack of lamb and my husband had the gnoochi with braised beef and both were fantastic. The only small negative of the evening was that the hostess was in the middle of trying to squeeze in a party of five when we arrived (exactly on time for our reservation). Instead of acknowledging us and telling us she'd be with us in a moment, she just kept her head in her computer screen and left us standing there for several awkward minutes. It was not the best way to start the evening but thankfully the rest of the dinner improved considerably.
September 16, 2015|Bartender left a lot to be desired, but ...|4|Bartender left a lot to be desired, but waitress for dinner, Ann, more than made up for her, dinner was excellent
September 12, 2015|really good|4|"i love good food and gourmet cooking. I am not a ""foodie"" and i found the menu diverse including lots of interesting things i wasnt interested in eating. had calamari and it was incredible! i only eat sea food when i dine out, and i didnt find anything that i wanted (there were items that i cook all the time at home). so i ordered the gnocci with some sort of squash and beef ragu. it was incredible. it was better than i remembered from our last visit there maybe a year ago."
September 9, 2015|Nice Date Night|5|The server was pleasant and knowledgeable. The signature drinks were unique and the food was amazing. I had the Duck and my husband had the Halibut.
September 3, 2015|Fantastic!!|5|We went for our wedding anniversary and it was such a great surprise! We have a new find as far as restaurants go and can't wait to go back. Food was great and service also great. We will definitely ask for Lynne when we return.
August 30, 2015|Mill's Tavern is an excellent dining experience.|5|Among the many fine places to dine in Rhode Island, the Mill's Tavern is a place for those interested in an experience that features some of the best food and beverages in RI. My friend and I enjoyed every aspect of our experience at Mill's Tavern and we were first-time customers of this establishment. Even though the staff is professional, friendly, and quite knowledgeable and the ambience of the restaurant pleasing and relaxing, the best part of our experience was the food and drink, which we are *still* talking about. Our appetizers were perfect, especially the king crab. We both had the filet and I can't remember having a more succulent and better-prepared steak at any restaurant anywhere in recent memory. It's the kind of meal that you want to savor, taking time to enjoy the food which was so carefully prepared and presented. It was the kind of experience that makes dining out a memorable and distinctive pleasure that doesn't happen too often. I would take any guest and any family member of mine to Mill's Tavern proudly and I know they would enjoy it. Thanks to all at Mill's Tavern, you made my week!
August 29, 2015|Just delightful in everyway and our serv...|5|Just delightful in everyway and our server Lynn was the best!
August 22, 2015|Not aging gracefully|4|Although the service is impeccable, the ambiance great, the food is over ambitious and just not up to,the level of the surroundings. We have the salmon and halibut, both were over cooked and under seasoned. The macaroni and cheese was a study in bread crumbs piled high. The menu is overly complicated with ingredients. I hope the restaurant can regain its footing.
August 22, 2015|A fantastic dining experience!|5|"The family went to Mills Tavern for a special dinner. There were 4 of us and we arrived on time, and our table was ready. We were seated and attended to by our great server right away. Service was excellent throughout our meal, always prompt and never rushed. The menu is very diverse and it was no trouble for each of us to get exactly what we wanted. We enjoyed our salads and moved into our entrees. The gnocchi was tremendous, flavorful and prepared unlike we had ever had gnocchi before. The others had steaks, two had the ribeye and one the fillet. All were cooked to perfection as ordered, flavorful and tender. Dessert was enjoyed with a fine assortment of sorbet, perfect after a savory meal, and an ""Affogetta"" which I did not sample but was told to be delicious. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our first experience at Mill's Tavern!"
Dined on August 20, 2015|AMAZING from beginning to end!!!|5|AMAZING from beginning to end!!! When making the reservation, the front of the house was so kind to show me and reserve a romantic table to two. Unbelievable service from Katie, who was knowledgeable, attentive and went the extra mile to make our dining experience special. The food was incredible and we enjoyed the seasonal summer menu. Must not skip desert…to die for!!!
August 14, 2015|Best meal I've ever had!|5|we went to Mills to celebrate my husband's birthday. Mills is amazing! everything we had was a little piece of heaven! from the shrimp to steak and lamb to dessert, you cannot go wrong. Marisa, our server, was absolutely fantastic and gave great recommendations. she didn't rush us which is huge and really helped make the night special! I never write reviews but it was so great I had to! I highly recommend and we will be back!
August 14, 2015|Birthday Dinner Success!|5|We had such a wonderful time celebrating my fiance's birthday. Our waiter (think his name was Phillip) was wonderful in every sense and really knew the menu. He had great suggestions and was never missing when we needed him, nor was he hovering over us. We both opted for the Summer pre-fixed menu and had fabulous meals. I had the calamari, duck, and chocolate cake which were all cooked to perfection. My fiance had the pork and a fruit custard I believe which he devoured. We had oysters for a special appetizer which were delicious and such a treat! We left with full, happy bellies and we'll definitely be back again!
August 11, 2015|Great New Wine List|5|Fantastic spot. We try to get here at least once a month. The wine list has been recently updated with some great new selections. Looking forward to my next visit.
August 8, 2015|Great Choice in Providence|5|One of my favorite restaurants in Providence. Great menu that changes seasonally. Service that is outstanding and an atmosphere that is welcoming. Highly recommend it.
August 1, 2015|Favorite restaurant in Providence|5|I've been here numerous times before over the years and it never disappoints, the food, service and ambiance are all great and I would always recommend Mills Tavern.
July 31, 2015|Providence and Mill's Tavern - fabulous!|5|The bartender knew just how to make my Martini and added 3 olives stuffed with blue cheese. Not only was it beautiful, but it tasted great and had a little glace of ice on top. A member in our group has a dietary restriction and cannot eat red meat or seafood. Mill's menu offered him several items to choose from. As for me, well, I love the steak, and as always, it was prepared just the way I like it, medium rare. My caesar salad was crisp and delicious. An ice cream dessert and coffee topped off a delicious dining experience with good friends who had nothing but good comments about their dishes. To be sure, my husband and I will be back soon!
July 24, 2015|Surreal experience|5|My girlfriend and I first went to Mill's Tavern for our anniversary. The waitstaff was incredible and accommodating, the pre fixe menu was out of this world, the ambiance felt like some kind of a movie set it is so beautiful. Naturally, we had to go back for Providence's restaurant week! Different season, same outstanding experience. The waitstaff remembered us from months prior and gave us champagne on the house. They offer a rewards card, where, though the meals are on the slightly expensive side, you can earn money with loyalty. They have earned two life-long customers- we will be back! :)
July 23, 2015|Mill's Tavern|5|Great food. Good selection. Best calamari I've had. Service good. Drinks a little on the high side. Easy to get to in Providence. Recommended highly.

Even with the abbreviated menu for restaurant week the three selections were fantastic: The lobster risotto with preserved lemon to cut some of the creaminess was amazing. Fantastic meal, excellent service and an enjoyable evening had by all.
July 22, 2015|Never fails|5|MT is always consistently outstanding. Restaurant week is the best time to try there fine dining. Always come home satisfied and happy. Valet parking, great service, exceptional pricing and seasonal menus...go now!
July 18, 2015|2nd time here (last was in the fall)  Lo...|5|2nd time here (last was in the fall) Loved the summer menu. Came with visitors from Europe who thoroughly enjoyed it! Loved the corkage opportunity, as we were able to enjoy a couple of special bottles we brought for the occasion.
July 18, 2015|A nice surprise!|5|We went on a recommendation from friends. We were early so the main dinner crowd had not arrived yet but the place soon filled. Our server Kile made the whole experience even better! My wife had the Wagyu beef that was on special, (Kobe comparison), while I had the Rack of Llamb, my daughter went with the Filet with Alaskan crab and her friend went with the Swordfish. We also had the Braised Littlenecks as an appetizer. Everything and I mean everything was great. The meals all arrived at the same time and properly prepared. By meals end the place was packed and you could see it was well organized. I will definitely be returning to this establishment!

July 14, 2015|What an incredible meal!|4|What an incredible meal. Let me start by saying the ròse wine flight was outstanding and a great price! Lobster risotto, seafood cioppino, and chocolate cake were perfectly done.
July 4, 2015|Always consistent!|5|Been going to Mills Tavern for years. Very consistent and very good! We were there on the 4th, the slowest night of the year on the Providence restaurant scene. I had the duck, my wife the filet mignon. Wonderfully prepared, excellent presentation, and oh so good! Our server Lynn, who's been there for a number of years herself, was excellent and very attentive...she always is, even on far busier nights. Overall, you can't go wrong going to Mills...it's pricey, (what fine restaurant isn't these days) but you'll get your money's worth. Highly recommend!
July 4, 2015|Terrific night out.|5|We thoroughly enjoyed our evening out at Mill's Tavern. The web reviews & recommendations did not disappoint and our service was outstanding. Our meal was a highlight of our Providence stay. It was an easy walk from our downtown hotel.
June 24, 2015|One of my best meals evet|5|Best salmon I've ever had, meal was outstanding. The fixed price menu was the best deal. Waitress had an attitiude. We weren't her kind of clientele and it was more than we usually pay for dinner. $150 for wine, salads, entrees, and dessert and we were stuffed. Very nice ambience, but not like any tavern I've been in. Would definitely go again if we're ever in Providence
June 20, 2015|Creative menu. Delicious food. Gracious service.|5|We had not been here in awhile, so we were pleasantly surprised by the wide and interesting choices on the menu. My dinner was excellent. The atmosphere is lovely, not as noisy as most restaurants these days. The wait staff is very professional. All made for a great choice of a restaurant to bring our Boston friends.
June 19, 2015|Lovely place!|5|This is our second time at Mill's Tavern. We went on the recommendation of a friend the first time, and thought of it again. The staff and service were absolutely superb! Our servers were very courteous and attentive. Water glasses were never empty! The food..........my goodness the food! Everything was so good! Their menus are seasonal so much of it changes about quarterly. It leaves a lot of room for the chef to play and create, and we were not disappointed by anything we had! Dessert was wonderful too! I gave ambiance a four only because of two minor things. One of the lights on the wall near our table had a loose connection or a bulb about to go out because it flickered and went from bright to dark sporadically, which was a little bothersome, but nothing major. The second reason was that our table was off in a corner right next to the bar, so patrons were a little close to us there. Not bad, again, just thought I'd mention why everything else was five stars and that lost one. Cannot wait to go back, hopefully to try the new summer menu!
June 12, 2015|Very nice, very elegant... but at what cost?|4|This was my first time back to Mills Tavern in about 5 years, owing to a miserable service experience at that time. i won't belabor it, because in 5 years one would expect waitstaff and management to change sufficiently that any cirticism is moot. And indeed, the service was excellent this time around. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, approachable... he even suggested a wine that was a great bargain, rich and full-bodied without breaking the budget. If I were to nitpick, I would have asked for him to be around a moment sooner. Also, I recall MT as eminently elegant, with crisp and austere service. This time, it was much more friendly, which I consider a bonus - I don't want a robot for a waiter - but it was not the same as I remember, and so that was a bit of a surprise. The food was very good... but honestly, not as well done as I'd expect for the price. My Wagyu steak was perfectly cooked, but served a tad cold, and not the quality of flavor or marbling as I'd expect for such a cut of meat. My friend's short rib was excellent - it always is at MT- but the asparagus side was no great shakes. Maybe a bit on the undercooked side, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and cheese, it didn't really seem to have the elegance I would have expected. It's probably a little late in the season for asparagus... which is why maybe it shouldn't have been offered. I expect a place like this to curate its offerings carefully; if the meat or produce isn't up to quality standards, they should simply not offer it. I don't think I'll be back soon, this time not for the service but the quality... I find the quality to be a little better at other restaurants in town with a smaller price tag. My compliments to the waitstaff, and even to the chefs, but I feel like the quality control was not quite what it should be at what is otherwise one of the highest-end establishment that Providence has to offer.

May 30, 2015|Consistently great, love the seasonal menu.|5|Perfect. Food, wine, service was top notch. Marisa was an excellent server who added to the experience.
May 29, 2015|Just so so......|3|First timers. Extremely loud. Not the place for an intimate dining experience. Food OK - nothing spectacular. Definitely not worth the high price tag - $175 for two - one drink each, two salads, two entrees, one dessert, two coffees. We've had better meals at other upscale Providence restaurants for more reasonable price. Will pass on Mill's Tavern in the future.
May 25, 2015|Excellent food in Providence|4|We were pleasantly surprised by the very high quality of the food and the great attention to detail from our waiter, Phil. Frankly, the only issue we encountered was the wait in between each course. We were there on Memorial Day after a busy weekend for the restaurant and it may be that they were short staffed. We will definitely be back!
May 19, 2015|Great Service|5|Food is always good. Service this time was excellent.
May 17, 2015|College Graduation Dinner|5|We had a group of 8 people for my daughter's college graduation dinner. The service, food and ambiance were all excellent. It was a great experience! Mill's Tavern helped make the day very special and memorable.
May 14, 2015|one of my favorites|5|Mill's Tavern is always a safe bet when it comes to birthday dinners or special occasions. I would definitely recommend it!
May 9, 2015|Great dining experience|5|We went to celebrate Mother's Day and a birthday. The bar was busy but the bartenders were attentive and friendly. Our waitress was excellent in offering specials and signature meals. We had a great night.
May 9, 2015|Always great!|5|Always a great place for a special occasion or just a night out that you want to be special!
May 2, 2015|Huge disappointment!!|4|I had taken some business clients to dinner here on Tuesday night and I had what I thought was the best salmon in the city. It was such a great experience that I wanted my wife who also loves salmon to experience what I had on Tuesday. We returned Saturday night only to be so disappointed. The salmon was not cooked, it was still translucent and limp, not firm. I felt so foolish!! I am not sure if there was different chef who prepared it but a sign of a good restaurant is its ability to be consistent. Now I know the food here is good quality and made to higher standards, maybe the chef just had a bad night? My son had the beet ravioli and the warm chocolate cake both which were very good.
April 28, 2015|Great Night out|5|Great wine selection and the BEST grilled salmon I've had in the city!!
April 18, 2015|Great place to dine with friends.|5|Mill's Tavern was a great find. The food was delicious, the wait staff was attentive and the wine list was varied, yet affordable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxed, yet comfortable place to dine with a seasonal menu that was impeccable.
April 13, 2015|Spring Menu and Service Fell Short of the usual|2|On every 13th of every month my boyfriend and I eat at Mills. Sometimes we do prix-fixe, sometimes not. No matter what we always have a great time. However, this past time is potentially the last time we'll go. They just changed to the spring menu and between pineapple allergies and an aversion to pork, we could barely find anything we wanted to eat. One doesn't go to Mill's with the intention to get a salad or simple sandwich. You go to enjoy interesting, modern American food with good service. However, not only did the menu seem off-base from the usually refined, unique taste palette for which previous menus were crafter, but our service was very poor. The waitress messed up our orders, argued with us when we apologetically said we weren't eating what we had initially wanted, and was downright sour when we didn't stay for dessert. We both left the meal feeling annoyed and disgruntled - not something you should feel after paying $150. Very disappointed Mills!
April 11, 2015|Very Good!|5|MT is on our Providence restaurant rotation. It's expensive, but very good. Our party ordered the veal steak, filet mignon, and halibut (2). The veal steak and halibut were big hits. Though I did not have the halibut, our guests raved about it. The filet was your standard fare fine steak, with little embellishment. We shared a mac n' cheese side. Everything was cooked to perfection...the sauce accompanying the veal was especially good. Drinks were well made and full pours. MT will remain as one of our goto restaurants in Providence. Can't go wrong...
April 11, 2015|Great first visit|5|This was our first visit and we loved it. Food and service were excellent. Raw bar was very good as well. Looking forward to our next visit while visiting our son at Brown.
Dined on April 5, 2015|Easter Sunday|5|We were a party of six, a group that rarely agree when it comes to dining experiences, but we unanimously gave Mill's Tavern a thumbs-up! the food and service was outstanding. Can't wait to go back!

March 21, 2015|Great Experience|5|Found the atmosphere, food, and staff to be excellent. Hostess was most accommodating, Jules our bartender was so enjoyable we opted to stay at the bar and delayed moving to our table once ready. Peter the oyster barista was extremely knowledgeable and delightful to talk shellfish with. Highly recommend! Will return when back in town.
March 21, 2015|Wonderfully Creative|4|I've dined at Mill's Tavern several times and they are I am consistently very satisfied. I enjoy the creativity with ingredients and the menu always gets me to step outside my comfort zone and try something new. We dined with friends who had never been to Mill's Tavern before and it went right to their short list of Providence restaurants. Our server did a great job of describing the raw bar options and the different flavor characteristics of the different oysters. Mushroom and brie soup was fantastic and could have been a meal in itself. Two had homemade pasta dishes (Sweet Potato and Gorganzola Gnocchi with Braised Rabbit and Spinach Agnolottis) and loved them. One had the Wagu Sirloin special and said it was one of the best steaks he ever had. I had the Seed Crusted, Bacon Wrapped Venison Loin which was amazing. The venison was cooked a perfect medium rare, while the bacon was sufficiently crispy. The seed coating provided a nice texture and the fruit, berry, Brussels Sprout combination provided a great flavor complexity. White Chocolate Parsnip Cake was different and a nice finish. The menu prices are definitely on the higher side for Providence, but definitely worth it. While I enjoy the smell of the wood burning cooking, it may be a consideration for those who don't, as it is not subtle.
March 21, 2015|AWESOME|5|Mills Tavern was an amazing experience. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, our server was outstanding to say the least. We will be returning. This place is a gem!
March 13, 2015|I love Mill's|5|My boyfriend and I often come here and have never been disappointed. The specials are consistently delicious and reasonably priced, the staff if very friendly, and the prix fixe menu is a great deal if you feel like trying multiple dishes at little cost.
February 28, 2015|COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER|3|Our first visit to Mill's Tavern. Initially seemed perfect - great setting, great menu, prompt service. We told the server that we were going to see a show and she acknowledged our deadline. We only ordered main entrees. The food arrived 45 minutes after ordering and we had 15 minutes to eat. I would not recommend the coq au vin, but the blackened swordfish was well prepared.

We often come in just for dessert. They have an excellent staff and the restaurant is beautiful I highly recommend for the nice night out!
February 28, 2015|1st Time @ Mill's|4|Had a wonderful experience. The waiter was over-and-beyond the expected. He was tremendously helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and where the products came from. The food was elegantly presented without being stuffy. Portions were adequate to amply satisfy. Price was as expected. Complimentary after dinner wine was a nice finish.
February 6, 2015|Over Rated|3|Mill's Tavern is simply not as good as it's reputation. I have eaten at this restaurant over ten times and every time when leaving I walk out saying, it does not live up to it reputation as one of the top restaurants in Providence. It is just not that good. Friday night was no exception, dry and chewy calamari, over cooked salmon. It is a nice restaurant but there are many that are better.
January 30, 2015|Excellent|5|Just one small complaint. There were many tables available for four due to a snow storm outside. It would have been better to seat us at one of the tables for four. Rather than the smaller tables for two. Other wise excellent.
January 25, 2015|The pepper calamari barely had any Bruss...|3|The pepper calamari barely had any Brussels sprouts or orange sauce. The 18 oz rib eye was thin and barely 15 ounces, and the salmon didn't have much flavor.
January 23, 2015|Superb Dinning experience|5|We thoroughly enjoyed for fabulous and skillfully prepared entrees. Meat dishes that just melted in your mouth. Our two favorites were the venison and short ribs. We wil highly recommend the Mills Tavern to all of our friends and we will definitely be stopping back ourselves.
January 23, 2015|Restaurant Week Delight|5|Mills Tavern's Restaurant Week menu is the regular tasting menu at a surprisingly affordable price. The food was superb and the service excellent. We were not at all rushed, even though the restaurant was at capacity. We won't hesitate to return for a special occasion with the regular menu or to return to the tasting menu for a more affordable experience.
January 23, 2015|Food good -portions small|4|Had dinner during restaurant week-thought portions were small-not a great value but food was very good.
January 18, 2015|Best meal I have ever had|5|Truly amazing! My boyfriend and I recently started going to fine dining restaurant and 6 months later, this is still our favorite. I ordered the gnocchi and every bite was was incredible. Our waitress was polite and well-mannered and gave us the best recommendations. I felt taken care of at this restaurant and recommend it highly to anyone who wants to eat some delicious food.
January 17, 2015|spectacular|5|Everything about our dinner was out if this world.
January 17, 2015|Sheer Perfection!|5|Our first visit to the Tavern was a memorable one and for all good reasons. The relaxed atmosphere provided a comfortable setting to enjoy a quiet dinner for two. We received outstanding service throughout our meal from Katie who timed each course exactly right. Its menu offered many mouthwatering selections, among them are two salads - a unique Caesar and the Artisanal Baby Greens in Maple Fig Vinaigrette. However, it was the Pan Seared Dayboat Scallops with a side of sweet potato and parsnips mash that offered a combination of unforgettable flavors and the Angus Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection. A return trip is already planned to sample many of the other selections that emerged from the kitchen, especially the Braised Little Necks in Smoked Tomato and Narragansett Lager Broth.
January 13, 2015|Loved it|5|A friend had recommended Mill's Tavern when I was looking to take a customer out for dinner. We all LOVED it. Very relaxed atmosphere, really cozy for the winter time. Everyone's meal was delicious and it was a very relaxed atmosphere. The waiter didn't rush us, nor the front desk to get us to sit. We all left full, happy and relaxed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good date night or to celebrate a special occasion - as it is a little on the pricey side, but well worth it in my opinion.
January 12, 2015|Overpriced and worth it if you can afford it.|5|Great food and service, pleasant atmosphere, and expensive for the average diner. Well worth saving up for. Had a great wine.
January 10, 2015|Wonderful restaurant for celebratration ...|4|Wonderful restaurant for celebratration of special birthday. Waiter seemed a bit too interested in pushing the most expensive wines and did not seem too knowledgable about the food, but everything we ordered was wonderful.
January 2, 2015|quality and quiet|4|I'm a regular visitor. perfect place for 4-6 dinner group. Pricey but good food and great service. I'd like to see more fish and seafood options on the menu. Also less bacon please! hard to find an appetizer or entree without it.
January 1, 2015|Mills Tavern - North Main, Providence|4|"My wife and I enjoyed another great meal at Mills Tavern. I had the sirloin and she orderd the pork - special. Neither of us ever get pork when we go out, however it was a delight. We orderd a bottle of Joseph Carr 2012 Cab priced $44. Once this wine opened it was very good and paired well w/ the steak and pork. We finished with their warm chocolate cake with some coffee. The only negative to this visit was the service. We never experienced ""ok"" service at Mills before and normally I would not say anything but when you reserve a table at Mills you expect the service and the food to be the best in the city if not southern New England. Better luck next time."
December 27, 2014|Perfect night|5|We celebrated our anniversary and it was lovely. We asked for a window view and had our own quiet nook. The food, as always - was outstanding. We typically order steak at Mill's Tavern and consider it the best in the city. The cocktail and Pinot Noir I enjoyed were both super. The sides were also well constructed and tasty. Mills Tavern is one of our go to spots for special occasions.
December 24, 2014|Mills is arguably the best restaurant in...|5|Mills is arguably the best restaurant in Providence, which is saying a lot given the number of good restaurants in town. Great for steaks, seafood, and killer desserts. Service is attentive and friendly without being obtrusive. Excellent wine list. Great location on North Main, near RISD and Brown campuses, and close to River Walk.
December 24, 2014|impeccable service|3|The ambiance and service was amazing here for Christmas Eve dinner. My date enjoyed his 4 inch porkchop very much however, I being vegetarian found the menu a bit limited and the portion quite small but delicious.
December 24, 2014|THE most exeptional service that I have ever had!|5|Our food was outrageous! The cocktails sublime. The wine suggested by our waiter was perfect for both seafood/pasta/red meat dishes at the table. Last, but certainly, not least - our waiter - Matt! Wow. This fellow would be an asset to any establishment. When we go back I am afraid that I won't be as happy should we have a differnt waiter. Might even have to ask if he is working and ask to be sat at one of his stations - that is how tremendous he was!
December 23, 2014|My favorite restuarant|5|As always, Mills tavern offered the best of everything. From the convenient location, great service, and amazing food, there is really nothing more to say. My favorite restaurant.
December 22, 2014|Great place|4|We have eaten here several times and have never been dissappointed. The menu changes seasonally so it never gets boring. The menu is varied with many choices, varied price ranges and they have a very nice 30.00 fixed menu as well. This is for us a Providence favorite.
December 21, 2014|A Pleasant Surprise|5|My husband and I were in Providence for the weekend. We researched a place for Sunday evening's dinner and chose Mill's Tavern. What a great find! The food was superb and the service impeccable. Our waiter, (I believe his name was Phil) was delightful. The menu changes with the seasons. It was the very end of Autumn and we both had the soup...squash, cheddar and bacon...outstanding! My husband had a pork dish and I had a meat risotto...both excellent. We will definitely return in the future.
December 13, 2014|Good, nothing amazing though|4|overall, a good meal in a nice and clean restaurant, can't go wrong, and not overpriced,

December 13, 2014|Creative, yet classy|5|Mill's Tavern is an excellent restaurant. The food was not only delicious, but also creative. On our latest visit, I was greatly impressed by the Apple Cheddar Bacon Soup with Fritters. That was one of the most creative and tasty items I have had in quite awhile. Additionally, the duck breast was cooked perfectly. The feel of the restaurant was both classy, yet comfortable. Very nice place to eat.
December 8, 2014|Loyal Fan|5|We are never disappointed at Mill's! Great food and service is their trademark!
December 7, 2014|Excellent quality and wonderful service|5|Our recent evening at Mills was a delight. The service and quality of our meal was excellent!
December 4, 2014|Gem!|5|Amazing food!!! Our server and hostess made the experience phenomenal. Thanks for the great evening.
November 27, 2014|Went for Thanksgiving|5|We went to Mill's Tavern for Thanksgiving and had a great meal, although we ended up not selecting the Thanksgiving offering. We were surprised to see a full (nearly full?) menu. We opted for scallops and braised short ribs. Both meals were excellent. The restaurant was very busy, with seemingly non-stop seatings, but the service never faltered, right down to calling us a cab as we left and providing a voucher for the fare. We look forward to going back to continue exploring the interesting and well executed menu, in a charming New England decor. Definitely worth checking out.

November 26, 2014|Phenomenol|5|This visit was for an anniversary celebration. It was probably one of the best meals we have ever had, and I personally feel this is the best restaurant in Providence. The staff is really at the top of their game and should be gratified to know that they are doing a fantastic job.
November 24, 2014|LONG Service Times, Wrong Temp Food|1|We went here for a business dinner and had high expectations based off of previous experiences. What we received was huge lags between each part of the meal, half of our meats cooked to the wrong temperature (and not by a picky small amount, but by completely different temperatures: rare when well was requested, well when rare was requested). The to go dessert was barely more than a bite and rather embarrassing - considering it cost $9. I wrote an email to the restaurant to provide this feedback and never heard back. Overall, this was an extremely disappointing experience and I may not return.

November 15, 2014|Has ups and downs.|3|The overall place was classy and nice. The service was really good. The food was just ok. The grilled sirloin steak was not a good cut of beef. It was loaded with nerves and very tough. For the price it should have been much much better then that. The swordfish was good but wasn't into the smoked grill taste. The drinks were very watered down. The waitress was very great! Right on top of everything! We would never eat here again due to the lack go quality in the food.
November 15, 2014|We really enjoyed our dining experience ...|5|We really enjoyed our dining experience at Mill's Tavern on Saturday night. The veal porterhouse and the duck confit were absolutely delicious. It was a pleasure to have Jason as our server. He recommended a perfect bottle of wine to complement our meal.

November 14, 2014|One of the best|5|One of the best restaurants in Providence. Superb food and service. A bit pricy but worth every penny.
November 8, 2014|Meh for the money...|2|I have come here many times and enjoyed it, but this last visit (11/8/14) was terrible. Getting attention from the waitress was an exercise in frustration. We could not even get menus.... It seemed she was preiccupied with another party at the big rpund table, and we were anafterthought.The food was just okay. I had the Branzino (fish) and it came to the table thin and dried out. The cylindrical cobb salad and Caesar salad were tasty but sparse. My friends say the meat was well prepared.We were seated at 7:30 and did not receive entrees until 10:20. We would have enjoyed dessert but skipped it because we did not want to wait another two hours.
November 8, 2014|Everyone loved their meal and the servic...|5|Everyone loved their meal and the service was very informative. They have a creative menu and feature wine flights that were great.
November 3, 2014|Great!!|5|Every time I come here it's always great. This time around didn't disappoint. Will be back!!
November 2, 2014|Excellent choice|5|We had an outstanding dinner at Mill's Tavern. We had requested special seating (tucked out of the way due to a hearing impairment of one of our diners) and the restaurant called to confirm that our request could be met and did a nice job seating us where everyone in our party could hear and participate in the dinner conversation. The food was great and the excellent service was memorable - attentive and highly professional without lurking.
October 27, 2014|Simply Amazing!|5|Every time we come to Mill's we always have an incredible meal. This time was even greater than the last. Exceptionally accomodating, superior service, fantastic wine, and our menu choices were perfect. Next time we will know not to share the foie gras. Not because it was small, but because it was so delicious we both wanted more for ourselves. My short rib was the best I've ever had, and her duck couldn't have been cooked better. It's obvious to us why we keep coming back to Mill's in a city that is so full of great food. This place goes above and beyond. PS - Save room for the bread pudding.
October 25, 2014|the restaurant was recommended by a frie...|5|the restaurant was recommended by a friend who is familiar with Providence. We first went to Waterfire and then to Mills Tavern where we had a drink at the bar before our table was ready and then were seated right on time. Waitress and overall service was very attentive and knowledgeable and all recommendations were great. Honestly would say that this was definitely one of the best dinners we have had in a while along with a perfect table in a quieter area. Overall great menu and food quality top shelf....also very good wine list at reasonable prices. Valet parking a plus as well. I give Mills Tavern a must try to anyone that is going to be visiting Providence.
October 24, 2014|Dining in Providence|5|Mill's Tavern does not disappoint for food or service; I have never been disappointed. It is a bit on the pricey side when compared to other restaurants in Providence, but you will not be disappointed.

October 24, 2014|Wonderful!|5|We picked Mill's Tavern for my son's birthday dinner and I'm happy we did. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed. The service was exceptional, though. I was worried that it could be slow after reading some reviews, but the waiter kept a close eye on our table without making us feel rushed and without making us wait more than a minute or two for service. About the menu. You will find dishes on this menu that are creative and well thought out. I love that! My son had the duck breast, I had the Black Angus short ribs and my wife had the butternut squash spaghetti. For desert it was creme brûlée, Portugese bread pudding, and Vahlrono chocolate cake which is baked when you place the order! I plan to go back as soon as possible.
October 23, 2014|Super service|4|It was our anniversary. So a special night for us. Our server, Kyle, was absolutely awesome. Very pleasant and polite. Very knowledgeable of menu and made good suggestions. Was at our table the appropriate amount of times, not constantly, but enough to make sure we were taken care of
October 22, 2014|First Choice|5|I lived in Providence 5 years ago when I returned Mills Tavern was my first choice food/atmosphere was excellent as always
October 19, 2014|This is one of our favorite restaurants....|5|This is one of our favorite restaurants. We use it for special occasions and have always been happy with the choice.
October 18, 2014|Really good food, a great date spot|5|I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. The food was excellent. The wine was excellent. The desert was excellent. It's expensive, but totally worth it. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Great job, everyone.
October 18, 2014|Meal was fair. Entre was braised black a...|3|Meal was fair. Entre was braised black angus and it was quite fatty.
October 16, 2014|Food is always great here-and it was aga...|3|Food is always great here-and it was again-the service is normally great but it was a a bit lacking this last time. We seemed to be the forgotten table-all night long.
October 15, 2014|Unmanaged Expectations|3|Our second visit to Mill's Tavern. On the positive side, the food at Mill's Tavern is delicious. We have no problem whatsoever with the quality coming out of the kitchen. This time, the problem lay squarely on the service. The evening we showed up for dinner, there were at least 3 other large groups (10+) people dining in the restaurant. From the minute we ordered dinner until our entrees arrived at the table, it was 55 minutes. Dessert took another hour to arrive. OK, I understand that the kitchen was slammed on a Wednesday night but after taking our order, the waiter did everything he could to completely ignore/avoid us for the evening instead of speaking to us and managing expectations.
October 14, 2014|Just gets better with age|5|Have not been here in a long time. Food and service was even better than I remembered. A really special RI gem
October 11, 2014|Coming back for desserts|4|"My wife and I dined here on a Saturday night. The ambiance is nice, with a noise level that never reached more than a moderate level; we never had any difficulties conversing in a normal, low tone. Our waiter was great and was happy to talk about the menu, wine list etc. The food - scallops and salmon from the ""autumn menu"" - was terrific; the spaetzle accompanying the salmon was perhaps a bit bland. The only real downside to the evening was that we were to full to try the (very inviting!) dessert menu. We had skipped apps, several of which I would like to try, to hopefully have room for dessert. Needless to say, we're coming back to try some more entrees and give that dessert menu a good. All in all, a really nice evening out."
October 11, 2014|Nice place, mediocre food.|3|Over the years we've had variable food. This last time the food was very mediocre.
October 11, 2014|outstanding food|5|"There is an award in the window of this restaurant stating it was the ""best restaurant in the world."" Well, maybe yes or maybe no but it is one of the very best I have ever enjoyed. The friendly, knowledgeable staff, the generous portions, the lovely presentation, all of it,, we all enjoyed ourselves immensely. Very very nice place to eat!"
October 6, 2014|Simply great stuff|5|Great service and great food makes for an outstanding experience. Very impressive.
October 5, 2014|You must eat here!|5|My girlfriend and I visited Mill's Tavern for the first time to celebrate her birthday. We loved every course of our meal: the drinks were excellent; the appetizer -- beef brisket risotto -- was like nothing we'd had before, in the most amazing way; the main courses were perfectly portioned and incredibly well-prepared. We will absolutely be back! If you haven't been before, please, treat yourself. Go to Mill's Tavern. If you want to show your taste buds that you love them, order the duck.
October 4, 2014|I bet chef frustrated|3|The food is really great there. So the underwhelming service is just a shame. It just doesn't have the level of service that the menu is at. Noisy like a Friday's, open kitchen so not a couples spot. But aside from that I take they are way understaffed. Slow food, slow taking away dishes, very hurried frZled staff. At least it seemed that way.
October 3, 2014|MILLS TAVERN IS A MUST|5|"We had an outstanding evening at Mills. I ate off the ""regular"" menu and my husband chose the prix fixe. Both were outstanding. We had rack of lamb and a gorgeous brined pork dish with wonderful pumpkin and spinach side dish. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. The wines were delicious and so reasonably priced. Our server, James, really made the evening b/c he was informative and friendly, but not in any way pushy or disdainful (like some waiters who look down on less sophisticated customers). He was great, great, great. Everything about this place is wonderful - fabulous bread and desserts. I cannot speak too highly of this restaurant."
October 1, 2014|Best Restaurant in Providence|5|"Mill's Tavern is consistently outstanding. The wait staff are professional, personable and have an excellent working knowledge of the menu and wine list. The menu is varied with many choices from game, beef, fish or vegetarian but not too many choices to be overwhelming. Interesting cocktails and exceptional deserts round out the experience. I have been to Mill's Tavern many times and one meal has been better than the next. Compared to other ""top restaurants"" in the area, Mill's Tavern is head and shoulders above the rest."
September 28, 2014|Great Food!|4|My boyfriend and I had a great time at Mills Tavern. The only complaint is that we wished we had been attended to more. The waiter seemed a little rushed and it was hard to get more than 2 rounds of drinks. If he had been more attentive the bill would have been higher
September 27, 2014|Bday visit from out ofstate|5|The place was busy when we arrived. Our table was view was not the pick of the tables but instead the least desired our view was a post wall. But the food and svc made up for the poor seating. A bit pricey but on a special occasion its worth every penny.
September 26, 2014|A re-discovered gem!|5|We had not had occasion to eat at Mills Tavern for a few years, but a gift certificate brought us back with another couple. We thought we would try it before we headed to a 7:30 theater performance. THe price fixe menu transfixed us...it offered three wonderful choices in 3 categories for $29.95. We all leapt in...and were delighted with all of our choices: pork risotto, salads, calimari, roasted pork with faro, three sorbets or heavenly warm chocolate cake. Dinner was absolutely delicious, our waitress, Marisa, was a doll, and at that price, we will definitely return...highly recommended!
September 25, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|3|Our experience was good not great. We have been previously and enjoyed the food and service much more on our other visits. It wasn't a bad time, but the overall result was below our expectations. Recommend: Lump crap app.
September 20, 2014|Was hoping for better|4|Having been to Mills a half dozen times in the past year, we had grown accustomed to great food and extraordinary service. The service remainded awesome but the food was disappointing during our last visit given the price point of Mills.
September 20, 2014|Mill's Tavern for Dinner|5|Mill's Tavern in Providence is a class act and worth the trip...
September 15, 2014|Oysters to die for!|5|But everything on the menu is excellent. Have eaten here 4 times and love returning. Warm, comfortable attractive restaurant near downtown Providence. Dependable food and attentive service.
September 15, 2014|perfect for a special occasion|5|Service and food were amazing. Started with the cheese plate which had four offerings: a bleu, a Spanish, a goat's milk, and a local cheese. All were very good, especially with their paired condiments. The ginger honey comb was particularly delicious. We both had entrees from the wood grill; my wife had the filet mignon with lobster salad, and I had the swordfish. Both were perfectly cooked and sized. We shared a side of mashed sweet potatoes and carrots, also very tasty. For dessert we sampled the chocolate cake which was a homemade lava cake style dessert, and the three flavors of sorbet. The cake and the coconut sorbet were particularly noteworthy. Service was extremely polite and friendly. The entire experience was wonderful!
September 13, 2014|Always fantastic|5|Always fantastic
September 13, 2014|Outstanding and Attentive|5|I can't say whether the staff was more accommodating due to my indicating this was a special occasion, but I do know they met all expectations. Window seat, pace of service, unexpected little 'extras' all made for a perfect meal. Jason was superb. We split a half order of the lobster risotto which was both delicious and just right in amount given the very generous entree portions. My (double) soy brined pork chops were cooked to perfection (yes, medium/pink, not dry). My date's lime brined chicken with wild rice, too, was superb. We simply finished it off with coffee, satisfied and sated. We'll be back.
Dined on September 13, 2014|Not worth the price|2|The wine has a high markup price. You can get a bottle for what you pay for a glass. I had Ahi tuna. I asked that it be pink and it came out raw and cold after waiting a very long time for the meal. I would categorize the meal as good but nothing was extraordinary except the prices.
September 13, 2014|We'll be back for the Fall Menu!|5|Everything was great. We sat by the window, as requested. Our server, Jason, was great, taking our queue to make recommendations. We were sharing among four of us so he made good recommendations across the board and by the time it came dessert, had already rightly assumed what we would like. The flights of wine, both the Mediterranean Reds and Whites, were perfect with the appetizers and meal. One minor recommendation - the stools at the bar are heavy and hard to move causing disruption any time anyone wanted to get in or out. Simply putting felt bottoms or plastic sliders on the feet would be an improvement for both those trying to move the stools and those near the bar who are trying to enjoy their meal.
September 13, 2014|Missed a bit|3|We have been to Mill's TAvern may times. This night the service was a bit off. Waiter seemed rushed and not on point. Food was good but wasn't cooked to the temperature we requested.
September 12, 2014|Great menu|5|The menu is seasonally changed so you'll always have something new to try and its always cooked to perfection
September 11, 2014|Mills Tavern was outstanding!|5|From the atmosphere, the food and the service. Everything was just perfect. We were celebrating our anniversary and the evening could not have been more romantic. The food was delish! It was beautifully prepared and just melted in your mouth! Our waiter made the night! He took great care of us by anticipating our needs and wants. He was also very entertaining and pleasant. It was our first time to Mill's Tavern and it certainly wont be our last! Thank you Mill's Tavern for making our Anniversary a night to remember. Cheers!
September 5, 2014|New Bartender|4|The bartender told us it was his first night. He forgot a few things. Other times, we've had better service. Hope he adjusts soon.
August 30, 2014|Perfect evenings are made here|5|Our first time here at the Tavern, but definitely not our last. The food was a treat to eat, simply scrumptious! The portions were just right, the food cooked to perfection and the dessert menu was a sweet tooth heaven. Definitely a place for a great night out with friends, or with a loved one.
August 29, 2014|The service was good, but the place was ...|3|The service was good, but the place was a bit noisy. I also wasn't impressed about the food. I ordered the lamb shank which came with mashed potato. Both were a bit citrusy for my taste. We tried Mill's Tavern based on recommendations but I do not it there will be a repeat visit.
August 23, 2014|Our second time here was better.|4|This was our second time here on our our Wedding anniversary. I booked though open table this time around and specified a window seat seeing it was number eighteen. We arrived fifteen minutes early to catch a drink when they mention your table is ready and right next to the window. Our waiter Jason was there shorty after mentioning happy 18 th wedding anniversary. We had a great time and the dinner was great
August 23, 2014|Wonderful food!|4|We had a special occasion and went to Mills Tavern to celebrate. We sat on the main isle, against a post. Not very romantic and very noisy, however, the food and waiter more than made up for the lack of intimacy. Exceptional service and great meals!!
August 23, 2014|Excellent!|5|I didn't know anything about Mill's Tavern until I checked it out on Open Table. It looked good so I made the reservation. I was expecting good and got outstanding! Free valet parking made it easy (but I tip the valets anyway) We were greeted and seated right away. Nice older building, great ambience. The service was very good, drinks were excellent. We were never rushed, the menu had so many great offerings it was hard to choose. My wife had the tuna, said it was the best she ever had. I had the short rib and it was the best I ever had. Bottles of wine seemed a little pricey but they offer flights of wine that were very good with a reasonale price and flights make it fun! It's not cheap here but worth every cent. I'll be back!
August 23, 2014|Great food, even better waiter|4|We were visiting from NYC and had a great pre-Waterfire meal on Saturday night. Our waiter, Phil, was amazing- very friendly and very knowledgeable. We all agreed that the calamari and halibut were two of the best seafood dishes we had ever had. The raw bar selection was great. The only downside: Unfortunately, my mother in law's meal came out room temp after a fairly long wait (timing may have been tough on a busy Waterfire night) and the cheeses on the cheese platter were not all that interesting. That said, we had a great meal in a fantastic location. I have already recommended the restaurant to family in the area.
August 21, 2014|Excellent|5|The short ribs were amazing!!! Honestly, possibly the best I've had. Also enjoyed our server…pleasant, knowledgable and lots of energy…Look forward to visiting again next time we're in Providence.
August 19, 2014|Awesome restaurant!!  It was my first ti...|5|Awesome restaurant!! It was my first time there and I will surely be going back.
August 16, 2014|Quality dining|5|Everything was excellent from the tasty cocktails and appetizers to the outstanding desserts.
August 15, 2014|Great food and service|5|I drove from Boston and visited for the first time. From the selection of wine to the food preparation and dessert all was great! The waiter Phil was knowledgeable about all the dishes. Braised ribs melted in your mouth.
August 14, 2014|Excellent food and service.|5|Mill's Tavern has always been one of my favorite restaurants for romantic dinners, special occasions, dinner with friends. Always excellent food, wine and service.
August 12, 2014|Miss the Tavern Menu|4|This place used to offer a great albeit limited three course menu for $30. We didn't always go this route, but it was a good-- and acclaimed-- option. We dined there last evening and it seems to be no longer available, or if it is, it's a secret you must ask about. It certainly was not mentioned to us. Otherwise food and service were good. Wish they'd bring back the tavern menu option.
August 9, 2014|excellent experience!|5|great food , excellent service easy valet - menu is outstanding!
August 9, 2014|Solid place|4|"We were lucky enough to get a ""day of"" OpenTable reservation, especially considering that it was a Waterfire night in Providence. Great location, Super friendly staff, and very nice decor. Our waitress, I think it was Kate, was super accommodating and patient. The menu is very diverse and offers some great options. We ordered 6 littlenecks (came with 7 - one of which was an empty shell - huh?), the duck pizza - a solid app but a tad bland (nothing some fresh pepper didn't fix). For entrees we got the lobster risotto (half size - which was plenty) and the short ribs. For dessert the bread pudding. All and all, a solid place, not an A+, but a definite return is in order."
August 7, 2014|Another amazing meal|5|This restaurant is hands one of the best you will find in the area. And Providence is LOADED with choices. Food is exceptional and service is even better.
August 4, 2014|Another great dining experience|5|We celebrated my wife's birthday recently at Mills Tavern with our favorite server, Lynne. This is one of the finest restaurant experiences anywhere. I cannot recommend Mills Tavern highly enough for any occasion, personal or corporate (I have been there for both). Ask to be seated at one of Lynne's tables and you will not be disappointed!
August 2, 2014|Excellent service, food was delicious es...|5|Excellent service, food was delicious especially the tuna entree!!!! Love the $1.00 oyster happy hour at the bar. Drink specials are delicious as well. Highly recommend this restaurant. Very rustic inside more for a rainy, chilly night.
August 1, 2014|excellent food|5|truly impressed both with the food, the wine list and the service. will return again soon.
July 28, 2014|Food is amazing!|4|My husband and I went to Mill's Tavern last year for our anniversary and loved it. We decided to bring our in-laws this year for their anniversary and were not disappointed. The food was amazing!! The meals are unique and delicious. Some of the best food I have ever had. We will be back.
July 26, 2014|Providence's Best Restaurant|5|Great food and service. By far the best restaurant in Providence. Steaks are the best quality anywhere. Asparagus with lemon & Parmesan is fabulous. Calamari was cooked perfectly.
July 26, 2014|Not run of the mill|5|We have dined at Mill's Tavern four times now, and on each occasion, the dishes were inventive and delicious (don't miss their seasonal heirloom tomato appetizer or the shortrib) and the service is outstanding. Desserts are spectacular.
July 20, 2014|Great choice!|5|I blindly selected Mills Tavern for our post-5k/beer fest dinner -- my husband thought a tavern wouldn't be as nice as this place turned out to be. Great food, awesome service from Kate, not rushed on courses/very well spaced out, and just a nice night. We plan to go back again when we're not so worn out! Love all the fresh ingredients that they grow onsite. And they provide comp. taxi service back to local hotels.
July 17, 2014|A Perfect meal|5|Our party of 6 was thoroughly satisified with our dining experience at Mills Tavern. All of the varied appetizers and entrees were prepared perfectly. I had the breast of duck; it was delicious, and prepared just as I had ordered it. Others had the halibut special, the short ribs special, and a steajk filet. They all raved at their dishes. The service was terrific-Our waitress was friendly and professional, and very helpful. It was a perfect meal.
July 15, 2014|a treat|5|the food was creative and well executed-eg-cayenne dusted fried calamari with okra. There is alot of variety on the menu although it did not seem plain enough for the table next to me (looking for lobster). Unfortunately for me the prices reflect the steps involved in making the dishes so interesting, so it remains a restaurant week treat for me. Enjoyed every bite.
July 14, 2014|Once again, a very pleasnat experience a...|4|Once again, a very pleasnat experience as part of Providence Restaurant Week. Menu choices were great, food was delicious and the service was very good. Looking forward to another visit soon.
July 14, 2014|Disappointing|3|Appears their normally excellent cuisine has slipped. Perhaps an off night. One in the party had salmon and was excellent. The others in group were not pleased either. Ambivalent servie. Sadly, won't be rushing back.
July 12, 2014|Excellent!|5|We haven't been to Mill's Tavern in a few years, and I don't understand why! The food and drinks are amazing. If you go, you MUST get the foie gras. It's a different presentation then usual, and melts in your mouth. My wife had the lobster and saffron risotto, which she loved. I had the rack of lamb which was very tasty. For drinks, the basil gimlet was outstanding as well. We brought out of town guests with us and they were impressed. We will definately be back. Don't forget to sign up for the rewards program!
July 12, 2014|Delicious dining experience|5|We were on an overnight visit to Providence and had an early reservation so we could be back outside for WaterFire. We were greeted by a friendly host, seated promptly, and the excellent service continued through the meal. Our server Lynn was perfect - attentive, very friendly, helpful and knowledgable, and she offered some great recommendations along the way. The food was amazing - we started with oysters and shrimp, had the halibut and the salmon with the asparagus side, and finished with panna cotta; drinks, wine, port. Everything was beautifully prepared and presented and cooked perfectly - a thoroughly enjoyable meal.
July 11, 2014|Amazing Experience!|5|Wow, what a meal I had this past weekend at Mill's Tavern. My boyfriend and I opted to go with the restaurant week menu, and it highly exceeded our expectations. One of the best meals I've ever had, and the service was top notch as well. Will certainly be visiting Mill's the next time I find myself in Providence!
July 11, 2014|Here for Restaurant Week|4|We came for restaurant week. The options looked very delicious. My date and I ordered the spring salad, the pork dish, and the cobbler. My only issue was there were onions in the pork dish which it did not say on the menu. I'll never understand why menus do not list onions as part of the dish. They'll list every other thing on the plate but onions. Obviously I am not a fan. Otherwise, everything was good. The drinks were great. I would probably go again for another special occasion.
July 11, 2014|Wonderful restaurant for special occasions!|5|My wife and I had an amazing anniversary dinner here. Prix Fixe menu is eclectic, delicious, and a great value!
July 11, 2014|Great food|5|The basic ingredients in my meal were not all that unusual, but their preparation was colorful, flavorful and unusual.
July 8, 2014|Great find!|5|I noticed this place was participating in Restaurant Week and had an awesome menu so I decided to come here for dinner. It was absolutely amazing. The food was tasty and the drinks were creative and delicious. If there was a negative it was that the drinks menu online wasn't the same as in the restaurant. Even still I found cocktails that were just as enticing. Can't wait to come back!
July 4, 2014|Great potential - weak execution|2|They seem to be so close to being good; as we've eaten here a number of times, food quality is always great, food preparation is hit or miss as is the service. We love the location and the atmosphere.
Dined on July 2, 2014|One of thr best!|5|The food was delicious! it has a creative slant that gave it a special edge above its competition. Our wait person, Lyn, was outstanding. Ask for her.
June 28, 2014|delicious and pricey|4|The food is innovative American and fantastic and the service impeccable. We love that you are never made to feel rushed at all. The prices are quite high so best to know that going in.
June 21, 2014|fabulous|5|We have never had anything but a fabulous experience when dining at Mill's. This time was even more special because we had our children with us. The chef prepared a special pasta dish for my son because the menu is a bit unique for kids. We really appreciated this. We love it here and will return again and again.
June 17, 2014|We all ordered the Prix Fix.  3 out of t...|4|We all ordered the Prix Fix. 3 out of the group ordered the Ox tail which had a lot of sliced garlic. A little much for some people. The swordfish was great. All the appetizers were wonderful. The deserts were outstanding.

June 11, 2014|Good Eats|4|Ordered from the reasonably priced prix fixe menu (chicken and pappardelle) and very pleased with our early dinner. Found the wine list to be ambitious (expensive) and limited ourselves to a single glass. Regular menu rather ambitious as well but thought the prix fixe menu comfortably priced and the servings an excellent value.
June 7, 2014|Waiter|4|"Was really taken advantage of by the waiter...He pushed the special of Tomahawk Steak never telling us that the steak was $109. Ridiculous. Told us he brings a couple home to throw on the grill all time. Very misleading. If you are offering a special like that you should disclose the patron the the price. Some of his comments were rude....it was my birthday....""left a bad taste in our mouth"" too bad. The waiter should be trained to make sure the price is disclosed it's not normal to have a steak that cost $109....."
June 6, 2014|Great experience|4|I took my daughter and two friend last week and we had a great. Nice cocktail and wine list. Loved the Valley of the Moon Pinot Blanc.My daughter had the cocktail with celery juice and gin and it was amazing. Oysters terrific, we had the calamari app and we all loved the addition of the artichokes. We split twp entrees, the halibut and the gnocchi. The broth and the spring peas were phenomenal for the halibut, the gnocchi was light and flavorful. Just a great time.
June 6, 2014|Excellent Providence Option |5|Skip typical and go with a unique alternative where Mills Tavern offers food creations and variety you can't find on Atwells Ave
May 17, 2014|Best meal we've had in ages!|5|This was our first visit to Mill's Tavern and we loved it! Everything was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. The main course was delayed due to some larger parties in the restaurant. But this did not detract from the experience. We'll be back!

May 11, 2014|Mother's Day Delight|5|We had a lovely luncheon at Mill's Tavern on Mother's Day. The food was presented quite nicely and tasted delicious.

May 10, 2014|Our first choice for dining|5|Mills tavern is never a disappointment. We've been there as a small group of 8 and also as a couple and the service and food have been excellent every time. Beverage and menu choices are exceptional and we ordered a variety of food from lamb to steaks to fish. A lively scene on a Saturday night but our first choice for dining and we travel the 40 minute drive from Newport for many special occasions.
May 8, 2014|Farewell Dinner|5|We had a private farewell dinner for a long time partner leaving for a new position. We had the small private dining room for 8 people. Service was excellent, allowing us plenty of time to socialize both before and after the meal and linger over after dinner drinks. Our waitress was very attentive and unobtrusive as well.Food was excellent as always, especially the Filet mignon, the duck and the HAlibut. We have use this venue for small business dinners before. It has always been excellent and this nuite was no exception.
May 6, 2014|Not Extraordinary|2|The menu descriptions were better than the actual food, except for the cocktail menu -- cocktails were terrific. Main course of house made parpadelle with oxtail and English peas was swimming with sauce. Dessert of molten chocolate cake was not exciting but was very tasty. Not having been to Mill's Tavern in some time, I was disappointed. Providence has a number of better restaurants in the same price range.
May 4, 2014|wonderful evening at Mill's Tavern|5|Friendly, pleasant greeting, knowledgeable waiter, food outstanding. Highly recommended
May 3, 2014|Pricey, but good|3|Overall experience was positive, although pricey. Found it unusual that a server would have to check what specials were still available when we arrived for a 6:15 reservation.

April 26, 2014|Excellent diverse menu|4|We had forgotten how outstanding the food is here - very fresh, delicious, and beautiful presentation. I had the duck, which was outstanding, and my husband had the halibut, equally excellent. Generous martinis, perfectly made and served; excellent service, attentive without overdoing it. The food and service made up for our initial disappointment at being seated at a cramped table for two in the side room adjacent to a register. The hostess tried to move us but every table was taken. If you value ambiance as much as food, I would suggest requesting a table in the main dining space unless you want a quiet meal set off to the side - then request the other room.
April 23, 2014|Excellent|5|Our server went above and beyond, and the food was unique and delicious.
April 20, 2014|An Unusual Disappointment|2|"Rushed service; a waiter who wanted to offer up his political opinions to the guests at our table; valet keys dropped at our table as we were informed ""the valet took off but you can leave a tip with the manager"" (for what?); we have been here many times and the food and especially the service were always exemplary. What a let down. After paying $300 for dinner for four, we won't be running back. An embarrassment for my husband and I as we brought the CEO of his company and his wife to Mill's for dinner. Too many great restaurants in Providence to be treated that way for that kind of money. We had to apologize to our guests."
April 6, 2014|Entrees, excellent; appetizers, meh|3|We were a bit worried after the 1st course - pork sampler served on a freezing cold plate (though one item was meant to be warm) and an utterly tasteless Caesar salad served also on a dish that was suspiciously cold suggesting it may have been sitting partially made in the fridge. The anchovy beignets were an interesting touch but the salad was barely worthy of them. Entrees - strip steak, salmon and halibut were all expertly prepared. The steaks had a nice smoky taste and were cooked to the requested doneness - no small feat. Desserts were nice, though not as spectacular as expected in a restaurant of this caliber. Would go back, but hope the restaurant takes more care with appetizers and first course items.
March 29, 2014|Always delicious|5|The food is always incredible at Mills Tavern. I have been there 5-6 times in four years. It is a restaurant that for us is for a very special night out / celebrating an occasion or event. The prices are high but it is in exchange for an excellent meal and dining experience. I have always been extremely impressed with the service, except for this past time. Our waiter's support staff were excellent and efficient, but he seemed to be having an off night and was frankly terse and unenthusiastic. I suspect he will not last long there, but I however will definitely be going back. Best dining in Providence.
March 29, 2014|Birthday din|4|Meals were great. Maybe I didn't read the website correctly but I thought the oyster happy hour was in the whole restaurant and not just in the bar. Still ordered them and they were delicious. The swordfish was reported to be fresh and light. The duck was decadent but the rabbit was a bit gamy. Would definitely get something aside from rabbit next time.
March 15, 2014|Server was only fair. Seemed|3|Server was only fair. Seemed more concerned abt other parties. Too much lag time between courses. Dirty dishes remaining on table. His name was Phil.
March 14, 2014|Great birthday celebration|5|Wonderful service, great food! They didnt rush you and folded your napkin when you left the table lol! My son ordered the special wagyu beef! That was an experience looked like it belonged on the flintstones. I do recommend asking the price of specials so not to be surprised when the bill arrives. Dessert was delicious wonderful choices. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
March 11, 2014|Highly Recommended|5|The food and service at Mills Tavern continues to be outstanding....one of the finest gems in Providence.
March 10, 2014|Great dining experience|5|You can't go wrong with anything on the menu at Mill's tavern. Decent beer selection, great wine list, sea food tower was fresh and delicious, entrees are great, and the creme brulee is out of this world. Great for a romantic night out, dinner with friends, or a business dinner!
March 8, 2014|Overall, great restaurant.|4|Overall, great restaurant. Would consider it a special occasion place due to prices. Only negative is being made to wait 10 minutes while table is being set even though we had reservation.
March 8, 2014|Not really worth the high prices!|4|Just as an example; bought the same bottle of wine at one of my other favorite restaurants for $12.00 less. Paid $109.00 for a special steak for two and it wasn't worth it; no better than a steak I'd pay $30 - $45 for at other restaurants.
March 6, 2014|Great meal|5|We had a great dinner with excellent service. The shellfish platter appetizer was incredible, assisted with oyster recommendations from our server. The short rib and pork shank entres were fantastic
March 1, 2014|Just excellent all around|5|Terrific dinner, generous portions, warm atmosphere . . . My husband had the generously-sized risotto with lamb which he adored, and I had the veal cheeks which, despite being listed as an appetizer, were large enough for a main dish for me after we split a salad. The table breads are also quite tasty, and the Portuguese bread pudding (large enough to share) was quite tasty and unexpectedly light.
February 22, 2014|Not worth it.|2|We were pretty disappointed with our experience. We had been there before when it was quieter, and the food was quite good. It was super busy. We had to wait to be seated even with a reservation. We were seated at a tiny table next to a large noisy group. The service was extremely slow, and the food was mediocre. There were bits of shell in my oysters and the scallops were overcooked.
February 21, 2014|So far so good|5|This semester, we switched the weekly seminar dinner from Henmenway to Mills' Tavern. So far so good. Good in the following ways: 1) So far, all guests finishes everything in front of them, they even used breads to brush clean the sauce. This did not happn when we were dining at Henmenway. 2) Accepts reservation, this makes it more convenient than Alforno when it comes to bussiness dinner.
February 20, 2014|Outstanding!|5|Great food and service! The duck breast was divine!
February 17, 2014|Very nice evening|5|Food was fresh and yummy. Service was perfect in every way.
February 15, 2014|Great food!|4|Loved my 32 oz T-bone steak that I shared with my husband. It was tender, tasty, and cooked to perfection. The asparagus as well as the mashed sweet potato & carrot was excellent as was the Malbec we ordered. The chocolate dessert was heavenly! And our waitress was very nice. Great evening!
Dined on February 14, 2014|Mill's Tavern|4|I took my girlfriend to Mill's Tavern for Valentines Day. It was our second time dining here and the first time was incredible to say the least. This time, however, not so much. The service was just alright. The appetizer (calamari) and entrees (Rabbit with Gnocchi and the Duck breast)were fantastic, but the dessert (Honey Sponge cake) was severely dissapointing. I realize holidays can be hectic for everyone involved, but I thought Mill's Tavern could handle it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll go back for a special occasion, but I will definitely be returning for a regular dinner at some point. All in all, Mill's Tavern is a great restaurant, but it fell short on Valentines.
February 14, 2014|Favorite place in Providence|5|We go here every time we're in town. The food is second to none and the atmosphere is perfect.
February 8, 2014|excellent|5|Tavern mill was beautiful and the food and service was amazing.
February 2, 2014|Reliably Excellent|5|"Mill's Tavern is our ""go to"" for special occasions. The wait staff are very professional. Meals are excellent and consistently prepared to order. The ambience is the icing on the cake."
February 1, 2014|A really good restaurant|4|This meal was excellent and our server was great. The food, wine and drinks will bring us back.
February 1, 2014|Consistently Good!|4|Have eaten at MT many times. Good food in a good atmosphere. Everything on the menu is well prepared, the drinks are well poured, and the ambience inviting. MT is on our regular rotation. If you haven't been, give it a try...
January 31, 2014|Delicious Selection of dishes|4|Three out of 4 got the Fixed price menu. It was very tasty and reasonably priced. The only disappointment was that there were no sides with the entrée selections. In my experience, a Fixed price menu is a complete meal, including sides. So it was a surprise to have our server ask if we wanted to order a la carte sides to go with the meal.
January 31, 2014|Best Restaurant in Providence!|5|We eat out very often and Mills Tavern is definitely a step above the competitors. I know this is hard to believe, but Mills Tavern Is the only restaurant that can cook beef well done without burning it (and that includes Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris, and Flemings). The menu is creative but yet traditional. This is still one of best restaurants in Providence.
January 30, 2014|Pris Fix|5|We thoroughly enjoyed the tavern menu. Our waitress mentioned that the portions were on the smaller side and suggested we add a side to share , however , that would have been too much food.
January 23, 2014|Business Dinner|5|Took 2 suppliers for dinner on Thursday night. Every time they come to RI they want to eat at Mills! We had everything from soup to nuts (and a little wine). All was outstanding. Two of us had the Wagyu steak (Australian beef likened to Coby). One serving could have satisfied the both of us. All and all a great dining experience.
January 19, 2014|I really like mills tavern|3|I really like mills tavern and have had plenty a good meal here. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the quality and service this time around. My friend and I went on a not so busy Sunday night and were placed at a very oddly situated hidden table. Our order was initially messed up (we were brought the wrong appetizer) and the food was pretty average. We got the prix fixe menu which was really the previous weeks restaurant week menu that had been carried over but usually there is a different three course menu always available every day except Saturday for $30. I have definitely had better experiences here this was unfortunately not one of them. One of my favorite dishes happens to be their grilled pizzas so that is def something to try!
January 18, 2014|Great food!|5|Was hoping to go for restaurant week (of which we thought we caught the last night of it), but the website didn't mention they weren't participating on Saturday. Since the regular menu looked so good, we stayed and ordered the lamb risotto half portion for an appetizer, the roasted chicken and the rabbit gnocchi for our meals. All of them exceeded our expectations which more than made up for the restaurant week bummer, but the risotto appetizer was so good we both said we should have just ordered full sizes of it for our meals. Pair that with their gorgeous bar and creative cocktails, not to mention half priced raw bar during happy hour (oysters are spectacular), will be back next chance we get!
January 16, 2014|Impressive food and service!|5|We dined during Restaurant Week and our meal was delicious! We also had a great waiter with a good sense of humor. We will definitely be back.
January 15, 2014|Always the Best|4|I'm amazed every time I visit Mills Tavern at the high level they are able to achieve and consistently maintain. Their food ,service and atmosphere remain superb. The restaurant is beautiful and has been kept that way over several years with consistently good maintenance. The chef and staff prepare wonderful standards while adding creative new items. It is never boring and always excites the patron.
January 13, 2014|Palate pleaser!|4|Went to Mill's Tavern for restaurant week. I've driven by it a thousand times and have never thought once about going in. Then, I saw the pre fixe options, and it became a must-try. The food was fantastic. We tried the calamari appetizer and agreed that it was some of the best calamari we had ever had--it came with lightly fried sausage and an interesting seasoning variety. The meal took a little longer than expected, but everything was delicious. Will definitely be going back!
January 11, 2014|Excellent as always|4|The food was spectacular and the drinks were phenomenal.
January 10, 2014|restaurant week = angry servers|2|"Long wait to be served and when we mentioned our interest in the restaurant week menu our server LITERALLY rolled her eyes and sighed. We asked if she was ok and she said ""this brings a lot of inexperienced diners here who don't tip well and its twice the work."" well.. ok, tell me how you really feel. 10 minutes later she comes back to take our order. It was only When we began by ordering an expensive bottle of wine and oysters to go along with our meal that she perked up and seemed to care at all. The food is usually great, but the dishes did NOT include what was advertised for restaurant week including the puree with filet and the chopped greens and citrus gastrique with the duck. Overall, massive dissapointment. Very upset about it."
January 10, 2014|food perfection|5|We went for restaurant week. All three courses were fantastic. My husband had the duck and said it was hands down the best duck he has ever had (he has eaten duck at many place all over the globe). The Portuguese bread pudding was also in a class of it own. our waitress was helpful and gracious.
January 10, 2014|Fitst timer|4|Mills Tavern was execellent. Wait staff was great as well as the food.
January 9, 2014|Restaurant Week Gem|5|Always have loved my experiences at Mills, but restaurant week is a great way to introduce yourself to Mills. We had Lynn as our server, who was excellent-attentive, knowledgeable, & pleasant!
January 5, 2014|Great dinner and service!|5|We will return to this special occasion restaurant with upscale, quiet ambiance. The staff made great recommendations and was very attentive. The foie gras appetizer was delicious but served with a pecan waffle that was too crunchy to cut easily. We also tried the scallops, rack of lamb and chicken main courses. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented and the dishes were quite large. A special treat was the side of macaroni and cheese with bacon lardons. Absolutely delicious! If you like a raw bar, this is the place. Great bar for drinks and appetizers.
January 5, 2014|Great Place|5|No Complaints Everything was Awsome. Including our waiter Phil he was the best.
January 1, 2014|My wife is a vegetarian and|1|My wife is a vegetarian and the server did not understand that there are other sources of protein other than meat. In the reservation comments I said that we were celebrating my wife's birthday. This was never mentioned at dinner. When I left, I asked about this and they blamed open table, that the info never transferred.
December 31, 2013|New Year's Eve|4|This is the second year that our friends and we have had New Year's Eve dinner at Mills Tavern. They do a very nice job of creating a fun ambiance without intruding on the diners. Food as usual is reliable and very good. Service was attentive. Would recommend it for dinner at any time.
December 31, 2013|Great food|5|Terrific dinner with perfect swordfish. Great service.
December 29, 2013|Took some out of town friends|4|"Took some out of town friends here, as they had previously enjoyed Red Stripe. The atmosphere is very cozy, and the noise level was great for conversation. The prix fixe menu was fantastic - great offerings, good size portions, and extremely reasonable in pricing. The lamb risotto was creamy, and the duck entree was well prepared. Our guests were pleased with their pasta dishes, as with the desserts (chocolate molten cake for me and almond pastry for them). My husband ordered from the main menu and greatly enjoyed the green bean side dish. Only downside on the evening was the service. We found the server a bit abrupt and cold, and she interrupted several times without an ""excuse me"". The rest of the servers were very attentive."
December 29, 2013|Great dining experience|5|Everything from the valet attendant,waking in seeing the great decor, being greeted by the hostess and Kate our server were all professional and friendly. We ordered a bottle of Barberesco I felt would go good with the mild Meat dished we were to order. Kate had a great knowledge of the menu, from the recommended Veal Cheeks, to the Rack of Lamb, she was great with her recommendations.The preparation of the food, flavor and presentation were all suburbs,
December 28, 2013|Disappointing|3|We've been to the Mills Tavern several times and have always had a great experience. This time, not so much. We waited close to an hour between our salad and the entree. When the Swordfish arrived it was OK at best. Ordered 2 glasses of wine and our server brought a bottle. She was very busy, so I didn't say anything to her. All in all the evening was a disappointment. We've had such great experiences in the past, I'll surely give the Mills another chance.
December 27, 2013|Fantastic Food|4|Food was amazing - definitely a diehard foodie menu. We had veal cheeks and fois gras for the appetizer - both were excellent. My husband had the duck breast and I had the short ribs - the short ribs are a personal favorite and the best I've had anywhere. The duck was very good but needed a sauce complement. Note- no kids menu here. They were kind enough however to make some shells and sauce for my 10 yr old.
December 26, 2013|One of Providence's Best|5|This is a very special place. Not to be missed! Excellent service (specal thanks to Heather and Lynne!) from the moment you walk in the front door. Fine food, great wines. Nice vibe. Simply wonderful.
December 24, 2013|Another outstanding experience|5|My fiancé and I had another wonderful dinner at Mills Tavern on Christmas Eve. Mills is more than just a restaurant to us. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. The food is the best we've ever had. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, it's all very good. It's never loud regardless where we sit. We also like to occasional get a light dinner and wine at the bar. We highly recommend dining at Mills Tavern! Ken and Allie
December 22, 2013|Doing the Right Thing!|4|Overall we had a great experience at Mill's Tavern. Our food was good, but the service was excellent. I had a little issue with my swordfish (consistency of it was weird...mushy like), but when I mentioned this to our server she talked to the chef and they took it off the bill. She mentioned that another diner had a similar complaint so there was clearly something off with the fish. In my opinion, a restaurant can redeem itself by how they respond to a complaint and in this case, Mill's Tavern did the right thing by taking it off of our bill! I would definitely go back and would recommend it to others.
December 18, 2013|Outstanding|5|This is the fourth year for our Christmas party and we all love the relaxed atmosphere and wonderful food. If you enjoy oysters this is the place to go to. Everyone got a different entrée and we all enjoyed the food. To top off the end of our meal we had a fine Port wine and a good list to choose from. Can't say enough about the wonderful service we received and all in a timely manner.
December 17, 2013|We went to Mill's Tavern while|5|We went to Mill's Tavern while on vacation in Providence -- my boyfriend, who went to school in Providence, remembered the restaurant being phenomenal during his college days. We went back and we were very impressed! The food was fantastic -- we started with the calamari, which was light and very yummy. I ordered the short ribs (which were some of the best I've ever had and the portion was HUGE!) and he had the duck (which was rich and perfectly cooked). We were so stuffed from our entrees that we had to pass on dessert, although the menu looked divine (I've regretted skipping dessert ever since). Food aside, the restaurant is a beautiful space and the service was wonderful -- it is definitely a gem in Providence.
December 13, 2013|Filet Mignon|5|I had the Filet mignon and it was delicious! Definitely want to go back.
December 6, 2013|What can I say? Excellent|5|What can I say? Excellent service and food! Very pleased with our first visit to Mills Tavern. The hostess even escorted me to the ladies room! We loved our whole experience! Will be back soon for sure!
November 28, 2013|the duck entree and the bread|4|the duck entree and the bread pudding were amazing!
November 28, 2013|terrific service and wonderful|4|terrific service and wonderful food. exciting, innovative menu. super accommodating to special requests
November 28, 2013|Thanksgiving|4|This was the most tender, juiciest turkey that I've eaten in decades.
November 24, 2013|Service was great; food well|4|Service was great; food well prepared; Caesar salad somewhat plain; excellent calamari; entrees were all good. My only issue was the price which seemed higher than comparable food/service elsewhere in Providence.
Dined on November 24, 2013|Elegant dinner before theather|4|Elegant restaurant that never disappoints .The service is impeccable friendly and helpful. The ambiance is a nice mix of old world elegance and contemporary warmth and we could hold a conversation without screaming. The food was well prepared with attention to details. The menu is seasonal and spans from fresh raw bar to hearty dishes . The short ribs were excellent and the clams had a wonderful balance of smoky and fresh flavors.The complimentary moscato nicely finished our dinner. I regard the Mills tavern as one of the best restaurant in Providence . The food summons what my city is about : New England tradition, European (Italian and Portuguese) influences all seasoned with passion for culinary excellence and warm hospitality.
November 17, 2013|Great Night Out|5|The food from salad to desert was out of this world. The waiter's suggestions were perfect for our taste's. We will come back!!!!
November 16, 2013|Great spot!|4|"Our first visit and we were impressed. We showed up a little early and ordered a drink at the bar (not much standing room). We were seated in a timely fashion. The food was outstanding and the service was also very good. Seem to take longer than usual between courses but we were there at the hight of the typcialy dinner ""rush hour"". Overall a very fun place with great ambience."
November 16, 2013|Mike|5|Mills is the best restaurant in town with a really fantastic menu, warm environment, and a great staff.
November 9, 2013|Satisfied again|5|The care of diners is excellent and the food is very good to excellent. We were not rushed or hovered over but every time we needed something a wait person was there anticipating our needs. We asked fopr a quiet table and we were put in the small room and it was perfect for talking and hearing. the portions were not hugh but we were more than satisfied and did not have room for dessert.
November 9, 2013|great atmosphere, subpar food|3|Great place to meet with a group and spend a lot of money. We had a great evening due to wonderful service and strong, plentiful drinks. The food was pretty lousy, though. It's been much better in the past.
November 9, 2013|Creative and High Quality|5|My daughter and I dined here on a Saturday night in November. We've had some excellent meals on Providence, and Mills was one of the best. I am still thinking about the absolutely amazing Chai Spiced Pumpkin and Squash Bisque with a bacon/apple tart (small piece) and sage marshmallow. I've been on a squash soup binge this fall and this one was the best I've had by far; what an unusual but wonderful combination of flavors. The pancetta, boursin, and chive Gnocchi with rabbit were also incredible, as were my daughter's scallops. I read on another review site that some think Mills has gone down hill; I strongly disagree. Hoping to return when my daughter graduates this May!
November 8, 2013|consistently good|4|we were going to be late for our dinner. We called t tell them and we were seated as soon as we arrived. I had the short ribs which were the best I have ever had. My wife did the $29 prix fix. She selected the sword fish which was very good.
November 8, 2013|Good but I won't rush to go back|3|I have been to the Mills Tavern many times over the years. I haven't been there for a while so my husband and I decided to try it. While the food was okay, it just didn't stand up to the quality of the past. I had duck which was a bit fatty and my husband had the short ribs, which he enjoyed. There was no special creativity, you had to order sides and I just wasn't as happy as I could have been with the experience there.
November 8, 2013|Had to ask who our waiter|2|Had to ask who our waiter was after a lenghty wait - would have left but waiter filled in & got us water and asked about drinks. Food was ok, not quite what we expected from reviews read. Doubtful we would go back with so many other choices.
November 7, 2013|My husband and I went to Mill's|4|My husband and I went to Mill's Tavern for our anniversary. We both had the prix fixe menu. I would say everything was very good, but somehow nothing was that exceptional or original that I would rush to go there again.
November 2, 2013|Once Again…..Outstanding!|5|Celebrated my son's 21st Birthday. This restaurant is outstanding. The service amazing and the food incredible. The atmosphere is Classic college town New England, upscale but inviting.
October 31, 2013|Excellence and Perfect!|5|Thanks for giving us a fun and romantic evening. The service and food was terrific!
October 27, 2013|One of Providence's Best !|5|Providence has so many great restaurants to choose from .. Obviously everyone has their favorites. Being creatures of habit ( as I am ) we sometimes miss out on a great restaurant like Mill's Tavern. I have not been here to eat in over 8 years ... what a mistake ! This is for sure one of THE best restaurants in Providence ! Their dishes are creative and delicious ... service was perfect ... do not hesitate to dine here.
October 26, 2013|Touched all the bases.|5|Great presentation. Great Food. Great service. Outstanding atmosphere. I will go back and udging from the volume and demeanor of clientele, and comments I over heard, so will/have many others.
October 26, 2013|25th aniversary|5|thankyou to mills tavern for providing a great place to relax with family and have really good food. our waiter James was as usual fantastic.
October 21, 2013|Birthday celebration!|5|Food was amazing! Wait staff professional and friendly. Great all around experience :)
October 19, 2013|Great Place|5|The food was fabulous - fresh and well seasoned. The service was excellent. I would definitely go back and recommend it.
October 18, 2013|Friday dinner|4|Positives: Food was delicious, Negatives: Noisy, not a good ambience and very slow service. We might have had dessert or coffee if it had not taken so long to be served our main course. Also, they could use a bit of light outside; sidewalk is very dark, does not feel unsafe but it is not easy to walk on the uneven sidewalk; even low-placed lights would have been useful.
October 16, 2013|Outstanding food, knowledgeable,|5|Outstanding food, knowledgeable, courteous wait staff overall rating by our party of four- exceptiona!l
October 13, 2013|True gem in Providence|5|We were amazed and pleased by the quality of the food and professionalism of the service; I had no idea a restaurant of this caliber was available in in Providence. The veal sweetbreads were one of the best I've ever had in my life, the presentation was beautiful and the flavors of the delicately sauteed meats blended seamlessly with the parsnip puree and pumpkin seed accompaniment. Both my colleague & I tried the duck, which was impeccable. We will be sure to be returning in the near future!
October 12, 2013|Another great experience here|5|Dinner for 4 and we were seated right on time despite the restaurant being very busy. Nearly every dish was excellent: the braised short ribs melted in my mouth, the onion rings with harissa sauce were outstanding, and the filet mignon was delicious. The only thing that didn't hit 5 stars was the gnocchi and rabbit entree: I thought it would be a rabbit dish accompanied by some gnocchi and vegetables, but it was really a pasta dish with a little rabbit mixed in. Still very tasty. And I want to emphasize that everything was cooked perfectly and without delay, despite the crowds that came for Waterfire.
October 12, 2013|Beautiful dining experience|5|All of the best. Great service, beautiful and charming atmosphere and amazing food.
October 12, 2013|Delicious food, excellent service|4|I brought my wife here for dinner to celebrate her birthday and it was a fine choice. I must say, the ambience is nice but less romantic than I expected... We were seated in the main dining room which is quite loud with tables close together. We were dressed up and most of the diners were pretty casual. Next time, I would make sure to ask for a more private table (they do have some). That said, the food was outstanding... One of the best steaks I've ever had, no kidding. And our server was friendly, helpful and attentive... He made it special.
October 12, 2013|Out Standing|5|We found this gem unexpectedly and kind of last minute on Open Table. We requested a large table for 2 and were happily accommodated! They were extremely busy due to Water Fires yet our service was outstanding as was the food/menu! Our waitress Lynne was very helpful and knowledgeable of the wine list and menu etc. It was a little bit pricey but well worth it. We'll definitely be back!
October 11, 2013|Great Providence|5|Slightly officious & slightly impatient waiter & a bit of a wait for our main course but we had an excellent evening nevertheless. Food was of excellent quality & imaginative - great presentation. Would definitely recommend & return.
October 5, 2013|Very nice restaurant, went|4|Very nice restaurant, went before firewater walk - very convenient. Very busy night,service was good early on then became very slow - took a long time to get coffee and the bill.
October 5, 2013|A must-try if in Providence|5|The menu is seasonal, and yet it has a very timeless feel. We love the wood fire grilled salmon and steaks. Sides are all a la carte and all are delicious.
September 30, 2013|Nice prix fixe menu but entrees|4|Nice prix fixe menu but entrees seemed too salty. Dessert and appetizers were fantastic.
September 21, 2013|Always Perfect|5|Absolutely delicious food, nnovative use of flavors, perfect restaurant decor and lighting, knowledgeable and all-around wonderful waiter. I don't know that it gets better than Mills Tavern anywhere.
September 21, 2013|Top notch dining experience|5|Great, inventive menu; service was impeccable -- server made a recommendation of an unusual wine (Barbera) that was a great fit with both of our dishes. Fish was perfectly prepared, with a delicious and unusual sauce. Mushroom gnocchi lovely. Fantastic dessert, also recommended by server. Ambience is lovely. Overall highly recommended.
September 5, 2013|High Recommended!|5|One of the best restaurants in Providence. The food, service and atmosphere could be better.
August 31, 2013|Can treat it like tapas|5|The entrees looked good, but my wife and I did the tapas thing cuz the sides and appetizers looked great. They were great we are looking to return soon.
August 30, 2013|Great food and service|5|Visited Mill's Tavern while on vacation for our anniversary, per recommendation of a local. We were not disappointed! Wonderful service, atmosphere and fantastic eats!

August 24, 2013|first time and last last time|2|food was under-cooked and meat was very grizzly... Server was knowledgeable but was not attentive enough. We were seated first by several minutes and the next table which was larger received more attention and their order was taken first. For the price I will not return especially since others have had similar experiences on this site...
August 24, 2013|Only gets better|5|My wife and I dine here 3-4 times per year for special occasions or when we want to introduce relatives from other parts of the country to excellent cuisine with local New England food. Menu is seasonal, always interesting flavor combinations. No complaints, only praise.
August 24, 2013|We had a wonderful experience|5|We had a wonderful experience at Mill's Tavern. Excellent food and service. Great place for a special occasion as it is pricey, but worth it!
August 17, 2013|Pricey, but great food and service|5|My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with a visit to Providence and a special dinner at Mill's Tavern. The menu and wine list provided just the right number of options. We especially appreciated the long list of wines available by the glass. We shared an appetizer of seared tuna, my wife ordered the salmon and I ordered the gnocchi and rabbit and we shared a side of grilled vegetables from the restaurant's garden. The grilled vegetable side dish was a bit too smokey flavored for my wife (I loved it), and in my opinion, the portions were too big (my wife disagreed and liked going home with leftovers). However, those are minor points, and on the whole, the meal was fantastic with the staff going out of their way to make it special.
Dined on August 12, 2013|fabulous|5|We are never disappointed when we dine at Mills... it is always fantastic!
August 10, 2013|Excellent food and service|5|We went there for the first time with friends for dinner before walking to see WaterFire. The ambiance was nice (we had a relatively early reservation at 5:30 pm) and we had a table right by the window, so it was pretty. The food was delicious and the server was beyond knowledgeable about the menu and was very social, which we enjoyed.
August 7, 2013|Mill's Tavern|5|"This is my favorite restaurant. The valet parking alleviates the frustration of finding parking downtown; the exposed brick and glass store front give it that ""New England"" romantic ombiance; the service was excellent; the chef was accommodating to my dietary needs; and there is a lovely selection of food, wine and dessert. I was also sent a 50.00 gift card in the mail, which I feel is the first and most important rule of business 101 - treat the customer right and they will return."
July 29, 2013|Count on Mills for the best|5|Celebrating our anniversary we chose Mills Tavern knowing we would have a top notch dining experience. We come to this restaurant about once a year and favorites are always the raw bar. They have a raw bar happy hour but you need to be in the bar not the dining room to take advantage of it. I had the most expensive steak I've ever had in my life - a Kansas city sirloin and while it was delicious, I would have preferred that the server tell me ahead of time that the cost was $79.00! I don't appreciate this kind of blind side.
July 20, 2013|Great Birthday Dinner|5|We arrived at Mills Tavern at about 7:15pm for a 7:45pm reservation. We went to the bar and had a drink. Our table was ready as promised. We had great service and a great meal. Our server recommended the Pork Chop which was excellent. The restaurant was very quiet which allowed for a great dinner conversation. For a fine dining experience, I would highly recommend the Mills Tavern!!
July 20, 2013|Apparently does not participate|1|Apparently does not participate in Restaurant Week on Saturdays. We had our dinner planned and reserved several days in advance and were very disappointed by our choices not being offered. The waiter was very nice, but if I'm going to pay $60+ for a dinner for two, I want my expectations to be met.
July 20, 2013|We visit Mill's Tavern on|4|We visit Mill's Tavern on our way back to New York from Cape Cod. It's often the culinary highpoint of the summer. We appreciate the interesting menu, terrific food and attentive service.
July 20, 2013|It was OK...|3|If we would have stopped with our soup and salad appetizers I would have given them a 5 star review. Both our main courses were not well prepared. They somehow managed to make my husband's fish tough on the outside and mushy on the inside. There were no vegetarian main course options on the menu which was also disappointing. We have been to this restaurant before and had a much better experience so we may give it another try but with so many great options in Providence it may be a while.
July 20, 2013|As always, Mills Tavern did|5|As always, Mills Tavern did not dissappoint. The food was fantastic. This will remain one of my go to special occassion places!
July 20, 2013|Strong performance by Mill's Tavern|5|Great dinner, service and WINE! Very knowledgable server (Lynne) and made the whole evening enjoyable.
July 19, 2013|Very special time at Mill's.|5|My kids were leaving town and it always special when we all get together with them. We were five of us and we had a great food experience, as well as the service, also Lynne does an amazing job managing her tables. Heather the General Manager always seem to be on the ball, managing her restaurant, checking on guests, on food, checking with the kitchen, also dresses sharp and always available. Thank you. B
July 17, 2013|perfect find|5|Though we eat in Providence often and have for many years, this was our first trip to the Tavern. We certainly wasted a lot of good times! We took advantage of Restaurant Week and as we have before found a really great restaurant. the three course meals could not have been better. There was a fruit conserve served with my pork that I told them them should bottle and sell! We will definitely return! Great service from Kate and very attentive support staff.
July 16, 2013|Great Service and Great Food|4|I visited this restaurant for Providence Restaurant Weeks. I think this is the right restaurant for someone who enjoys a bit of a pretentious atmosphere. The restaurant is attractive and generic but upscale in design, the staff were very professional, but for me, it was too pretentious which, for me personally makes it less of a relaxing experience. I had steak which was delicious and cooked to my specifications. I don't have any complaints, but for me, I just don't fit into the environment so I wouldn't go back. As I said, food was delicious, service impeccable, price was high.
July 14, 2013|will give it another try|3|Sent food back poorly cooked then second meal badly seasoned. The waitstaff was so nice I want to give them another try.

July 13, 2013|Restaurant Week Dining|3|We chose Mills Tavern as it was a participant in the Providence Restaurant Week. Unfortunately, the night we selected was not a night in which the Restaurant Week Prix Fixe was honored. When I was searching for a restaurant to dine, several restaurants clearly indicated which nights that they were not honoring the Restaurant Week specials. I did not see this clearly indicated for Mills Tavern. Nonetheless, after feeling a little duped, we still stayed and had a nice dinner. Come to find out, the couple sitting next to us also had chose Mills Tavern as a Restaurant Week selection, also to feel duped. I highly recommend the Little Necks with Narragansett and Chaurice broth. Very nice and flavorful.
July 12, 2013|great experience at Mill's Tavern|5|The food and service were amazing, and the ambiance was perfect. We went for restaurant week, and couldn't have been happier that we chose Mill's Tavern. I will definitely be going back!
July 11, 2013|Fantastic Providence Gem|5|We went for dinner at 7:30 on a Thursday night for restaurant week, and Mill's Tavern was absolutely fantastic. The hostess was very gracious when we added an extra person to the reservation when we showed up. Our server was very friendly and took our orders efficiently for such a large party. The food was amazing. Most of the table ordered the housemade sausage/corn risotto, the lavender duck, and the chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The portions were very well-sized for a three course meal. I was definitely feeling rather stuffed at the end but extremely satisfied with the food. A couple other friends ordered the flight of wine for an additional $12 (3 glasses for $12!) and said that the wines were great.
July 10, 2013|Love it here!|5|I've been here a few times before and each time it's fabulous. We came for restaurant week and were very impressed with our server's knowledge of the food items and wine flights we decided to get. All in all it was another exceptional night out at Mill's Tavern
July 10, 2013|Two thumbs up...|5|Exquisite food and great service. Experienced during Providence Restaurants Weeks and from appetizer to dessert, both my and my partner's plates were incredible tasting with interesting flavors. Can't wait to go back...
July 9, 2013|Gem in the Rough!|5|I don't say this often for those who know me well but I'm so impressed on the overall quality and attention to detail on the tastes and selections. A great business casual environment with great service. Chef and seasonal options are a must to consider. This is my first choice on every trip I make to Providence!
July 5, 2013|We have been several times|4|We have been several times because it's convenient. Everything was good, but I find it somewhat overpriced and somewhat pretentious.
July 1, 2013|My parents and I went to Mill's|5|My parents and I went to Mill's Tavern on a free evening during a visit to Providence, and we had a wonderful time. The prix fixe menu is a great deal! The food was wonderful and there are lots of great choices on the wine list as well, including half bottles. The atmosphere is great too. We walked over to the restaurant as you could from quite a few of the downtown hotels. It was a fun time!
June 29, 2013|Awesome!|5|Great food complemented by awesome service. Our waiter Matt was truly a professional who made the whole experience a memorable one for our Anniversary.
June 29, 2013|Great food, somewhat annoying staff|4|Wonderful food as always. Our wait staff was at the table non stop to the point that it was very annoying. That would however not keep us from returning for a great dinner.
June 27, 2013|Excellent|5|From beginning to end was perfect. Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgable about the entire menu. Food was amazing ane the creme brûlée was to die. Perfect date night for my husband's 50th birthday!
June 22, 2013|Excellent!|5|My wife and I celebrated both our 25th and now our 30th anniversary at Mills Tavern. On both occassions we have been very impressed with the restaurant. The service from all the staff was top notch and the food was delicious. They rotate their menu seasonally so you are always presented with new and tasty menu options. Our waitress - Lynne - was able to answer any questions we had for her. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine dining experience.
June 14, 2013|Really Nice Time|4|I took my Mom here on Friday night and we had a great time. We ordered off of the Pri-Fixe menu and it was simply delicious. The calamari was awesome and our waiter Phil (i believe) was incredible. I live 5 minutes from Mills Tavern and I guarantee they will be seeing me again :-)
June 13, 2013|Oysters & Tiger Shrimp were|5|Oysters & Tiger Shrimp were awesome as usual! Lamb, Scallops & Short Rib entrees were all delicious. Service was great!
June 8, 2013|Another Great Night|4|Fresh Matunuck Oysters, wonderful - brothy soup, amazing Wagyu tomahawk chop rib eye. Waiter - Matt (erudite) was fun and filled with good anecdotes and witty banter.
June 7, 2013|Great food! Great night!|5|This was my first visit to Mill's, and hopefully not my last. Was here on a Friday night for my brother's birthday. He requested Mill's for this occasion. Our server Phil was top notch. The drinks and the food were fabulous. I had the salmon and it was served with the most delicious succotash. I tried a bite of everyone's dinner...the only one I thought fell short was the chicken. It is brined in buttermilk which gives it a slightly sour taste. Whatever it was served with, however, was very tasty. We all got different flavors of housemade sorbet and they were all fantastic but apricot and blackberry were my favorites. My father had the bread pudding and while it is not a typical bread pudding, it was AMAZINGLY good! Great night!
June 6, 2013|Still one of our favorites|5|"We have dined at Mill's Tavern at least 10x over the past three years and have always been thrilled by the creative seasonal menu and first class service. When we treat friends from the west and midwest, Mill's is our means of introduction to the best of New England cuisine and ambience. The Prix Fixe menu (not available on Saturdays) doesn't leave one feeling deprived. Valet parking in their downtown location is a necessary convenience. The noise level can get up to ""3"" but our last visit was on a Thursday evening after local graduations and a calm evening. When the wait staff learned it was our anniversary we were treated to complimentary champagne."
May 31, 2013|Our service|5|Our service from Kyle (sp?) was impeccable! She made the experience memorable as we were celebrating my sister's retirement !! She made the dinner very special.
May 31, 2013|Excellent food with great service|5|We had a great meal here. Lots of choices on the menu. Leans a bit to the gourmet side in terms of food offerings. We had short ribs (tender and delicious!) and ostrich (tasty!). Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Great evening overall.
May 30, 2013|Amazing|5|Excellent food, great ambience and great service. Valet is free and fast! Wife had the filet and we both thought it was better than Ruth Chris'. Ostrich is very good and the lamb risotto app is incredible! Great place to celebrate an anniversary or special occasion.
May 29, 2013|Well worth a visit. Incredible|5|Well worth a visit. Incredible service, tasty dishes and nice ambiance.
May 26, 2013|Great Providence restaurant|5|We chose Mill's Tavern for a special graduation celebration and we were delighted with the experience. Small mixup with our reservation so the restaurant opened a private room for our party. Service and food were excellent!!
May 18, 2013|Excellent All Around|5|The food here was conversation stoppingly good! Trying bites of my husbands meal, he was trying bites of mine. It was absolutely delicious and it was during graduation weekend as well, so the kitchen was REALLY busy. Our server (Lynn I believe) was extremely busy herself and also did a fabulous job of making our party of two feel just as important as her other tables. I have already recommended others to this restaurant and I will most definitely be returning.
May 18, 2013|Just Fabulous!!|5|Have not been to Mills Tavern in some time because the service was not good when I was there previously...after 2 tries you get on my list of Do Not Return....Anyhow....I gave it a go last Saturday nigh with some friends--and it was in the midst of College Graduation Rush--we had a 8:15 reservation and were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation--the Hostess was the best and was so on top of getting patrons in out seated--great job! Our wait staff..the very best helped me pick the Scallops...yum yum yum...my friends had the Salmon and were still talking about it the next day.... In spite of the restaurant being so busy there was no rushing of us to get our order in or any of that...service service service...Plus very reasonably priced!
May 18, 2013|Very good but pricey...|4|Mills Tavern is very good and very consistent. We've dined there regularly. Anything on the menu will be excellent and they pour a good drink. My chronic complaint has been that everything on the menu is (over)priced by $2-3.00+ compared to similar quality restaurants in Providence...so the value proposition is not as strong as other places. One of the specials on Saturday's menu was a steak for 2 priced at $105. I get that it's going to be a high quality piece of meat, but come on, that's still over $50/head. I can handle that in New York or Boston...seems a tad much for the local scene.
Dined on May 15, 2013|Very welcoming. Good, well-informed|4|Very welcoming. Good, well-informed waiters, Very good food. Nice ambience.
May 11, 2013|Wonderful Service!|5|It was my first time and I had a wonderful time. The food was delicious and the service impeccable.
May 11, 2013|GREAT RECOMMENDATION|5|THE DINING EXPERIENCE WAS OUTSTANDING FROM DRINKS TO DESSERT! WE HAD A GREAT WAITER,PHIL,WHO MADE SOME DELICIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS. THE CALAMARI IN A BLUE CORN MEAL AND THE BRAISED LITTLENECKS WITH CHOURIZO WAS GOBBLE UP! OSTRICH,SALMON AND THE FILETS WERE PERFECT AND THE BREAD PUDDING AND CHOC CAKE FINISHED OFF THE NIGHT! I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE SERVICE TIME BETWEEN COURSES WAS ON THE SLOW SIDE AND IT WAS... BUT IT ALLOWED ROOM FOR DESSERT!
May 11, 2013|Fabulous experience.|5|This was a great experience for our combined birthday/Mother's Day celebration. Service was exceptional and the food, delicious from the fish to the filet. Pricey but worth it.
May 8, 2013|Perfection|5|My husband and I celebrated his birthday there the other night. We pressed the maitre-d to seat us at the window...so much more ambiance. The service was extra-ordinary and generous. The food was utterly delish...I had a filet that melted in my mouth and I loved the bacon lardons and greens on the top. The bread pudding was amazing...
May 5, 2013|Not a great evening|2|I've been to Mill's Tavern a number of times and always had at least a good, if not great, meal. Unfortunately, this evening was an exception, which is too bad because it was an anniversary celebration. My Caesar salad was limp and had very little flavor. My entree was missing the meat because the chef accidentally made a vegetarian version. The waitress was not terribly attentive. Overall, I'd say Mill's Tavern is good but does not approach the inspired and inventive menu of its Providence competitors like Gracie's. I don't think I'll be back for a while.
May 3, 2013|Wonderful|5|The food was delicious and the service was great. Try the asparagus.
April 30, 2013|Seated in perfect spot, near|4|Seated in perfect spot, near the window, secluded by a pillar. Server was attentive and friendly. We found many dishes on the menu to attract us. The food was very good, but we felt the busy flavor combinations didn't always achieve greatness. Some tastes were lost in the mix. I went with the prix fixe menu, a fantastic value. When next visiting Providence we will be back.

Finished with the Greek Yogurt Panna Cotta, Vanilla Poached Pineapple, Toasted Coconut Granola and Sweet Basil Cream. Delicious meal, excellent service, spectacular evening. Thank you.

April 19, 2013|Perfect Dining Experience|5|Now officially my favorite restaurant in Providence. Couldn't have had a more perfect dining experience. Valet parking, ambiance, service, and best of all, the food was simply amazing. Will definitely be returning again and again.
April 19, 2013|It is way overpriced for the|3|"It is way overpriced for the quality and portion size. $43.00 for a 2"" ordinary filet mignon was ridiculous. For those prices the food should be transcendent snd it wasn't. What is recommended is the $30 prix fixe menu. Portions were still small, like 3 medium scallops for one entree, but it was excellent and a better value. I was still hungry when I left, but at least I didn't have to mortgage the house to pay for my meal like others did."

April 13, 2013|We enjoyed our dinner there|4|We enjoyed our dinner there Saturday evening. Booked through Open Table and it is a little annoying that the restaurant calls you and you have to call back to confirm even though you made the reservation on-line...you receive countless emails as well. Waiter was Jason? Needs to be a little quicker to refill cocktails.
April 13, 2013|A fabulous dining experience!|5|Outstanding meal! Outstanding service! Every morsel was delectable. Our server was attentive but never intrusive, very knowledgeable about the menu, patient with our questions, and had a lovely sense of humor. Overall a fabulous dining experience!
April 13, 2013|Superb food and service.|5|Superb food and service. As fine a restaurant as we've been to in ten years.
April 6, 2013|Overall a very good evening,|4|Overall a very good evening, but two areas that could be improved: there was a very long wait between appetizers and entrees, and then the entrees were not hot. Two wines on the wine list were no longer available in the vintages shown on the list, that should really be kept up to date.
April 6, 2013|Delicious and innovative food,|4|Delicious and innovative food, would definitely recommend for a special occasion for this reason. Service was very kind and helpful and I'm not one to want a constantly hovering server, but there was more than a comfortable interval between check-ins at the end - took an hour from the time we ordered dessert to the time we received the bill (though we could have been more pushy if we had really needed to leave sooner). The primary thing that wasn't so good was the tables were too close together in our seating area so that the waiter next to us even knocked over our candle without realizing it and conversation was a bit uncomfortably close to our neighbors for a special occasion. If I were to go back I would ask to sit elsewhere.
March 31, 2013|This was our 5th or 6th time|5|This was our 5th or 6th time dining at Mills Tavern - always for a special occasion. As always the food and service were outstanding. We always look forward to the menu, especially the cocktails.

March 30, 2013|It was our first visit to|4|It was our first visit to this Providence restaurant. Our party of 4 was seated promptly and offered good service througout the evening. The staff was well versed in the menu, slightly less so with the wine list but we were very pleased with their efforts. The food was straight-forward and imaginative. The meals and their pairings of sauces and garnishment were well thought out and worked together. I would say that the food wasn't over the top but, frankly, most people don't like over-the-top fare. I can't think of a single complaint. The portions, given the level of culinary skill, was generous; in fact, no room for desserts. We left knowing we would be back.

March 15, 2013|Like many restaurants in Providence|3|Like many restaurants in Providence, the simple preparation of entrees has gone the way of the dodo. Too often too many ingredients are combined in a dish that after a few bites you forgot what you ordered. There are good items to be found (the sirloin steak was excellent, although it could have been hotter - seemed like it took several minutes to go from grill to table) and I wouldn't deter anyone from going. For me, though, I prefer to savor simpler preparations and will continue to seek out a restaurant that embraces this philosophy.

March 2, 2013|Everything about our experience|4|"Everything about our experience there was great. The only deduction was for pokey service and food delivery. The timing was extremely slow- from getting our food and drinks, to table clearing. Our server was very knowledgable and sweet, but tempo was off as a whole. All of the food was excellent. I had the rack of lamb. Great choice. Desserts were fantastic. Overall it was a fun night with friends and great food. I would go back and just chalk it up to an ""eh"" night of service."
March 2, 2013|disappointed where we were|4|disappointed where we were seated- table abutted station for order entry/drop off station, and was in very close proximity to next table- felt crammed, and this side room did not have much character. desserts were ok, offerings a bit boring. mahi mahi was outstanding. disappointed in drink and appertizer offerings.
March 1, 2013|Rude bartender|1|We where early for our reassertion so the hostess said have a drink in the bar.. We went to sit down at the bar in two empty seats and the bar tender was very rude and said she was saving them for some one else so we had to stand with our drinks while the whole time the bar seats remind empty ....it was our anniversary and it ruined the night we will never go their again

I got a veal chop which was very pricey and although cooked to perfection, it was over seasoned. Two of us got the gnocchi. they liked them. Desserts were terrific and the service was good. Everyone worked well as a team. friendly atmosphere for a Providence eatery.
February 16, 2013|Outstanding Dining Experience!!|5|Absolutely loved Mill's Tavern! Wanted to try some place different for a belated Valentine's dinner and saw it on Open Table. It was one of the best dining experiences we ever had! Michelle, our server was excellent! She was personable, attentive and gave great recommendations. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the strip steak and both were phenomenal! The restaurant has great character and an open kitchen, though were seated in the back facing room which was very quiet. Will definitely go back!
February 16, 2013|Always impressed,never disappointed|5|"My wife and I always try to save our trips to Mill's Tavern for special occasions because we want the fantasy aura around our experiences there to remain. However, I think we could eat there every day and it would be special each time. The menu is on the expensive side but the pricing is entirely appropriate; unlike many ""high end"" restaurants in the city, you get what you pay for and more at Mill's. The creativity of the menu, the fact that there's something for every taste, the regular staples along with the seasonal rotation of dishes, and the exceptional choice of appetizers, sides, and wines to pair with your meal make every trip overwhelmingly satisfying. Oh and by the way the ambiance is beautiful and the staff is extraordinary."

Server was attentive and not over-worked (too many tables). We had a reservation, but we sat in the side room away from the open kitchen which reduced the atmosphere for us a bit. Definitely worth a try if you have not been. Valet parking was a must on the busy city street.

February 5, 2013|Memorable dining experience!|5|Entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by a warm, friendly host that seated us right away. The decor was elegant, with table linens and smells of good food cooking. We ordered cocktails. I had a Cosmopolitan, and it arrived with it's own little shaker. It was perfectly executed and there was a generous quantity. I ordered the Sirloin Steak, medium and we had a side order of brussel sprouts for the table. The waiter told us exactly how long the food would take. My steak arrived on time, at the perfect temperature. My companions ordered the Short Ribs and the Osso Bucco. They were happy with the food. I tasted it, and found it flavorful and tender, however my steak was amazing. I had warm chocolate cake for dessert. Awesome!
February 5, 2013|I went on a midweek evening|5|I went on a midweek evening so the number of patrons was relatively small. The service was excellent and the food was perfect. I went off the prix fixe menu and had the Risoto & duck breast. Both were done perfectly. The wine selection is ok and fairly priced.

My only complaint was not with the restaurant but rather disappointment that people don't dress up anymore when they go out! This place is too nice for jeans and sneakers! Dress up, people!

January 26, 2013|Never Disappointing!|5|This is one of me and my Fiancé’s favorite places to eat. We had our first date here 4 years ago and go back at least once a year. We would go more often but we live in Boston now and it is hard to get down to Providence all the time. I would recommend this place to anyone! We will continue to go here for as long as they stay open which seems to be a very very long time! Thank you Mill's Tavern for NEVER disappointing.
January 25, 2013|We had a wonderful dinner|4|We had a wonderful dinner for Five on Friday night. Mostly ordering from the beautiful Restaurant Week menu, we could not have been more pleased with our food. The Pork Risotto, Flat Iron Steak and Bread Pudding were luscious. Our waitress could not have been nicer. The only complaint: very very slow service. A lot of time between courses. Should the chefs be reading for a routine Friday night crowd? Fortunately, we were having a wonderful time, the food was delicious and it was ok to have European service at that time.
January 25, 2013|The food was wonderful and|5|The food was wonderful and service very attentive and professional. We'll definitely return to sample other items from their creative menu.

January 24, 2013|The food at Mill's Tavern|5|The food at Mill's Tavern was outstanding. From the seemingly simple things like mac and cheese (bacon lardons!), to the perfectly cooked duck breast, I was very happy with my dining experience. They also had an extensive wine list and a solid beer selection. The prices seemed a little high at first glance, but the quality made them seem like a bargain. You get what you pay for after all. We will definitely return!
January 22, 2013|Our all-time favorite restaurant|5|Our all-time favorite restaurant in NE, hands down. Each time we have visited Mill's Tavern, the food has been exemplary, the service impeccable and the overall experience completely satisfying. Even the simplest of comfort food dishes are elevated by their wood-fired kitchen - for example, the humble mac n cheese becomes a rich, smokey pot of delicious that perfectly compliments the melt-in-your-mouth steak. Good food, expertly prepared. Oh, and the pastry chef is one of the country's best-kept secrets - her skills are nothing short of alchemy.
January 22, 2013|Mill's is usually a special|4|Mill's is usually a special treat, but we went to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu. Three diners got different things and everyone was quite happy with their meals.

January 19, 2013|Great food, service and ambiance|4|For a special night out with another couple, Mills Tavern on this Saturday evening was a very good choice. The restaurant was packed, yet our reservation time was honored immediately and service was outstanding. Our meals were enjoyed by all. Two of us had the Salmon and both agreed it was one of the best preparations we can remember. The other two had the lamb shanks and thought it was the best they have ever had. So, this was a great choice.
January 18, 2013|Great Restaurant Week menu|5|I went for restaurant week January 2013. Mill Tavern's menu was great, as was the service. They also noted that they offer a prix fixe menu year round at the same price as the RW menu and it changes regularly. So I'll be back.
January 18, 2013|Always solid, but now even better!|4|I've been to Mills a number of times in the past, and always enjoyed it. It can be a bit pricey, so it is usually on my short list for special occasions. But last Friday, a friend and I decided to go back for the restaurant week price fixed menu. It was FABULOUS! Our waiter was great, service was quick, but not rushed, and all of our courses were delicious. It didn't feel like were were being treated as second-class citizens, which can be the case when visiting higher end spots during restaurant week. The desert course, which can feel like a bit of an afterthought on many price fixed menus, was absolutely decadent (Warm Chocolate Cake and Buttery Baked Bread Pudding). I will definitely be back to Mills for the regular menu!
January 18, 2013|The challenge of eating at|5|The challenge of eating at Mill's Tavern is deciding what to order. The menu is extensive, imaginative, and well-executed. Everything we had was delicious, as always. The service was excellent as well.
January 17, 2013|Delicious elegance|5|Fabulous, as always. Mill's Tavern will always be one of our favorite places to go, not only for the outstanding food, but the whole package.

January 16, 2013|pretty but bad food|2|The place is very nice, music a bit too loud. Server didn't want us to order the restaurant week emnu which was very bad- we ordered 2 versions and both were fit for a one star restaurant. Would not recommend it
January 13, 2013|I love Restaurant Week almost|5|I love Restaurant Week almost as much as I enjoy Christmas, and Mill's Tavern blew me away. Generally speaking, two out of three good courses is enough to make me happy. This Restaurant Week prix-fixe menu is -- hands down -- the most satisfying one I've ever had -- NYC and Boston's RW's included. My boyfriend and I ordered the risotto with pork cracklings and the calamari for an appetizer; duck and flat-iron steak for an entree; and the molten chocolate cake and Portuguese bread pudding (which I asked them to (please) stick under a broiler for 20 seconds). I would go back again for this menu alone. Our waiter was fun and knowledgeable about wines.My boyfriend and I had been to Mill's Tavern several months earlier -- great.
January 5, 2013|Mill's is one of my favorites|4|"Mill's is one of my favorites - not just for dinner but even to just sit at the bar at ""happy hour"" and have a cocktail and oysters! The food is always delicious and the service attentive. Just don't sit in the inside corner of the side room - it does feel a bit like you have been ""put in the corner""."
January 4, 2013|perfect special night out|5|Everything was set for our special birthday dinner out. The food the ambiance, the professional wait staff were all done to perfection. With the exception of the roast duck which was a bit undercooked, it was all delicious. I would definitely return, for any level of occasion. Ooohh, and they even went to the trouble of fitting my wine preference, and dug us out a new wine not yet on the menu, which was superb!
January 3, 2013|As much as I enjoy food, dining|4|As much as I enjoy food, dining in a comfortable, pretty room adds much to the experience and the dining room at Mill's Tavern is one of the nicest in town. The stone, wood, starched white tablecloths, comfortable booths and chairs are all inviting, especially on a chilly night. The welcome and service is consistently good and the food is always excellent. My personal favorite reason for considering Mill's as one of my favorite restaurants is the fact that they are one of the very few restaurants in RI which serves fresh foie gras, always prepared to perfection. Beautiful food served in a beautiful atmosphere Mill's Tavern is perfect for date night!
January 3, 2013|Terrific ambiance, especially|4|Terrific ambiance, especially the bar area. Excellent service. Like the seasonal menu. Had the rabbit stew which was very good but a little light on the meat content. My wife had the risotto which was excellent. Complimentary dessert wine a nice touch.

Every plate brought to the table was beautifully crafted, and tasty. We were so impressed by the food, it made up for slow service. 3.5 hours for three courses is too long. We understand food cooked to order, and the patience needed however, drinks should never be empty so long that you must cue your waiter for attention. With many bussers, and servers around attention to the small points could have been sharper. But the food...the glorious food makes you extra forgiving.
November 30, 2012|Great Night|4|Great night out. Short Rib was delicious as usual. Wine selection is great. A nice spot out for a special occasion or just a nice relaxing night out.
November 30, 2012|Always a delight!|5|We have loved Mills for years... it never disappoints. From the valet outside parking our car, to the host who sat us, to our fabulous waiter, it was outstanding as always. The menu is so unique and ever-changing, it is so fantastic.
November 30, 2012|Nice concept, poor execution|2|Nothing terribly creative or innovative about the food. My wife had a rabbit ragout. Portion size was appropriate; however, I'm not sure the chef knows the difference between a stew and a chili. There was some shredded rabbit in the dish; but it was nearly indetectable in the bowl of sauce. That sauce itself was overpoweringly sweet, to the point that she didn't want to finish. Her appertizer was a risotto. Again, basic errors: She was presented longgrain rice, standing on a plate in perfectly concentric balls, with no cheese or truffle oil. That's rice, not risotto. My pork dish was adequate, but nothing special. Service was 'team' style, where the runner never knew who ordered which dish. We won't be back.
November 22, 2012|We've been to Mill's Tavern|5|We've been to Mill's Tavern on multiple occasions and always had a good experience. We were looking forward to going on Thanksgiving as we weren't having our family gathering until Saturday. It was busier than normal and near the end of a long day for the staff, they had started serving dinner at noon and we arrived shortly before 7pm. Our table wasn't ready in time for our reservation though this is not a surprise given the holiday; Mill's was one of the few restaurants open that evening. We waited in the bar area, which was also packed at this time, again no surprise. After about a 20 minute wait our table was ready and from there we enjoyed another excellent meal.

Although the restaurant was full, we were seated at the time we had reserved. This may become our regular Thanksgiving meal. Certainly if we eat out on Thanksgiving, it will be at Mill's Tavern
November 22, 2012|Giving Thanks|4|This reservation was our first time eating out on Thanksgiving. Mill's provided an un-fussy but delicious turkey dinner -just like home. The service was not hurried or rushed and i knew that they were fully booked due to a reservation change I had asked them to accommodate. We enjoyed a relaxed dinner which was very good and would definitely return to celebrate the holiday again.
November 17, 2012|Glad We Tried It!|5|I had a bit of trouble making my online reservation and the receptionist was actually rude when I called so I wasn't too psyched to try Mills Tavern, but the reviews swayed me. Boy am I glad they did! Complimentary valet parking was a nice and unexpected welcome, the bar scene was hopping and we were shown to a great table by the window. Not sure I would have been so happy eating in one of the tables close to the bar with people standing too close to you. My swordfish was amazing and my husband had pizza and gnocci and both were outstanding. We need to go back when in the mood for meat - it looked amazing! Also need to leave room for dessert - they were all tempting.
November 17, 2012|Never disappointing- great|5|Never disappointing- great food, great service, great environment; An pretentiousness but elegant presentation of classics done well in a well designed and well maintained space with intelligent and attentive service staff.

The seasonal menu is ever changing, and quite dynamic, this is a serious draw for anyone looking past usual fair offered by nearby chain establishments. On the down note, the 2 team wait staff while informative, seemed one step behind filling drink orders, and not quite in sync with each other.

The chicken dish I had was dry and rather flavorless. The risotto, a part of our appetizer, was similarly bland. All in all a mediocre experience that was nonetheless pricey!"

Highly recommend it.

September 15, 2012|First time disappointed.|4|We have been here many times and the food has been excellent. Tonight was the first time I have ever been disappointed in my meal. I was thrilled to see that a half order of lobster risotto was an option because I do not have a large appetite. When it arrived the portion size was perfect but the only detectable lobster was one claw sitting on top. I have had lobster risotto in many places in RI and all were much better than this. They all had pieces of lobster mixed throughout. My husband had the rabbit and the calamari and both of his were excellent.

My only complaint was that the rotisserie chicken, which is noted as coming with potatoes and beans, came with so few of each that I didn't actually notice them.

Unacceptable to me. Also, a table for 2 was seated 20 minutes after we were sat, and got there food before we did. Also unacceptable. Food was good, but we won't be back.

August 24, 2012|While we found the food to|3|While we found the food to be good (we had the rabbit and the swordfish, as well as the curried lobster and scallop ceviche), it seems there are too many ingredients in the dishes so that the taste of the main ingredient (e.g., lobster) is lost in the mix. Service was also a bit too fast (entrees came out within 2 minutes of finishing the first course) and too chatty (you don't have to recite every item on the menu - we can read) for our taste, at least for this caliber of restaurant. We'll try it again, though, but maybe next time we'll sit at the bar.

They would not honor the prix fixe menu on a Saturday, even though the website says nothing to the contrary, and it went downhill from there. The original bottle of wine ordered was not available, so a substitution-would not do a prix fixe selection, but we were encouraged to order appetizer, entree, and dessert for the regular menu prices-overly long wait for entrees-told several times that peach shortcake was available for dessert, but then it mysteriously was not available. Waitress was annoyed with our questions. Only two highlights were the complimentary glasses of dessert wine & polite valet.

Nothing was terrible except my completely overcooked salmon, which I sent back and asked for no other food. (They did offer, but after eating a tasteless vegetable tureen appetizer and the poorly prepared salmon sitting on a bed of congealed grits, I did not want any more of their food.) The bottom line is that all of us declined dessert, since none of us enjoyed the tasteless food, so why waste calories there?

I had the rack of lamb which was cooked medium rare as requested. Yummy! The lamb came with string beans and mashed potato. My husband, who was not very hungry,and had the macaroni and cheese side as an entree. Since it was meant to be shared, it was definitely enough for a meal for one. The mac & cheese while tasty was nothing special. We also enjoyed a bottle of cote du rhone. It was a nice complement to the meal. The service was good, although our waitress spilled wine on the table. Thoughout the meal, she was appropriately attentive--refilling water and wine glasses.

Lobster risotto fell a little short of expectations. server was a bit distracted in the beginning of the meal, maybe over extended but warmed up toward the end of the meal. Flexibility in menu because evertything is made to order was a big plus, especially with guests that have dietary restrictions. Complimentary Valet was prompt and friendly. Strawberry Rhubarb tart was great.
July 19, 2012|An Eye for Flavor and Presentation|4|I am glad a group of friends chose Mill's Tavern for Providence Restaurant Week . The three-course meal gave me an excellent glimpse into Mill's Tavern wonderful eye for presentation and mastery of flavor. All six of us were not only impressed with the intimate setting, but loved each of our dishes. Even for a Restaurant Week menu, all of the dishes were reasonably portioned and wonderfully executed. Our waitress was very professional but warmed up to us by the end of the meal. Definitely a great restaurant- I'd expect nothing less from such a wonderful culinary city.

My wife took advantage of the prix fixe menu which was really quite a bargain considering the quality of the food. The calamari practically melted in your mouth and my wood grilled swordfish was cooked to perfection. Our waiter was absolutely outstanding. He was genuinely interested in explaining the different dishes to us and recommended a very reasonably priced bottle of wine (which was excellent). We've been to restaurants costing much more than this where the service was not half as good. We'll most definitely be back.

June 25, 2012|The room is handsome. Service|4|The room is handsome. Service was very good, except that no one brought us my leftovers at the end of the meal. [I could, to be sure, have asked for it, but I didn't have much interest in eating the lamb (see below) the next day anyway.]. The calamari appetizer I had was the best calamari I have ever had. Really delicious! My husband said his sweetbreads appetizer was lacking in taste. He liked his short ribs, which he has ordered numerous times at Mills Tavern. My lamb dish was presented beautifully and the potatoes were delicious, but I thought the lamb itself lacked taste and/or the mustard overpowered the taste of the lamb. The bread pudding dessert, which we have had numerous times, was delicious this time, too.
June 23, 2012|Just what a restaurant should be!|5|From the fresh calamari to the coffee at the end, the meal, service and entire experience here was fantastic. Small but robust wine list, menu was amazing. (they change their menu 4 times a year for seasonal adjustment). We can't wait to go back.

June 6, 2012|Our Favorite among top Contenders|5|"We have lived in the area for almost 3 decades and Mill's Tavern ranks consistently in our top three for date night, special occasions, and introducing the friend or relative from distant states to some of the best New England cuisine. The menu changes quarterly to embrace what is in season. Meat and fish always fresh. One can count on interesting, creative and very delicious combinations of foods within each course. Servers are true professionals who know their menus and enjoy working where they do. Often an unexpected ""treat"" will appear at the table. We celebrated our anniversary at our last visit and near the conclusion of the meal received two glasses of a South African Moscato."
May 25, 2012|Mills Tavern is one of our|4|Mills Tavern is one of our favorites in Providence. The food is always outstanding. The atmosphere very nice, and the wait staff great. The people at the check in desk are another story-usually very unwelcoming. The last time I made reservations was for Brown University's graduation weekend. The woman on the phone-Lisa, was very rude. I ended up making my reservation through open table and she called me later that day to tell me I was NOT allowed to do that!
May 18, 2012|Service was not what I expected|3|Service was not what I expected for a restaurant with these prices and such an upscale menu. I felt I was being served on my way back and forth from other tables that were getting service. Very lackluster.
May 17, 2012|Ideal Date Spot|5|Mill's Tavern is unequivocally my favorite date spot in Providence. The cuisine is consistently outstanding, balancing expertly executed standards (last visit my boyfriend's filet mignon was superb) and more innovative dishes (my open-faced rabbit ravioli was a triumph). Set in a picturesque historic building, with windows that frame some of Providence's more attractive architecture, Mill's Tavern has an ideal romantic atmosphere. What really distinguishes Mill's Tavern, however, is the quality of service. For professional, efficient, and, thoughtful service, Mill's is unparalleled in Providence.

Attention to detail from the experienced staff is always key (swapping out white napkins for black when the diner's attire requires it, immediate wine paring suggestions for different entrees, etc).
May 2, 2012|Fabulous French/Italian Food|5|The food at Mills was FANTASTIC! It is a fusion of French and Italian. The waiter was very good, but the service was a tad slow. One tip for diners--order the deliciuos side dishes with the main course, as they come a la carte.
April 28, 2012|We had high expectation about|2|We had high expectation about the food and service at Mill's Tavern; none of which were met. Service was slow, and considering we were there early because of Trinity schedule, baffling. As a consequence had to skip desert because we ran out of time. Server, given two wine choices, recommended one which everyone enjoyed. One appetizer, fois gras, overcooked, one (sweet breads) excellent. Of the three entrees ordered (one was shared), two came out lukewarm at best and had to be returned and heated up, and the third one came out way overcooked (a glazed salmon) even though the server recommended it not be. Disappointing and disappointed.
April 26, 2012|Where have all the waiters gone???|2|My husband and I have long regarded Mills Tavern as one of the best restaurants in Providence. Our experience this past week was different from previous ones there and quite disappointing. One of the pleasures for us of dining at Mills Tavern had been being served by knowledgable, charming, attentive waiters. None of the waiters we had known for years seems to be working there any more, and their replacements - at least the one that we had - lacked all of the qualities that we had valued and enjoyed in their predecessors. I have no idea why Mills Tavern made the change they did, but it was not one for the better; and even though the food was good, we'll probably not go back there as soon as we might otherwise have done.
April 21, 2012|I think that Mill's tavern|3|I think that Mill's tavern is a case of a good, but over-priced restaurant. My wife and I shared the special mussels appetizer. While the broth was excellant, the number of mussels was embarrasingly small and, priced at $21, made it a very poor offering. The alternative would have been the clams priced at $17. As a main course, we each ordered the sole roulade. It was wonderfully prepared and, at $26, was probably the best value on the menu. However, we felt the need to order a side (potato at $7) since the sole was not presented with any vegetable or starch. However, most disturbing was the service. Once our waiter determined we were not going to be a $200+ customer, he seemed to lose interest. Bottom line: food: B+; Price & service C-
April 21, 2012|I hadn't been for about 5|3|I hadn't been for about 5 years (it is a trek). In that time, the food has changed (it's not as good now), it got noticeably more expensive, and the wine list is much less interesting. But, we still had fun. The food was good, though not memorable. Our server found a wine that wasn't on the list that worked, though the markup was outrageous (you can get it for $15-20 retail, and they charged $58). And, the service was quite good, actually; the best part of the experience.
April 17, 2012|I haven't been to Mills Tavern|5|I haven't been to Mills Tavern in about a year but it is every bit as excellent as I remember it. When you have creative dishes using a wood grill AND a wood oven (there are also non-wood items), how can you go wrong. Small but nicely selected and priced wine list. Terrific bar where you can hang out before and after dinner. Great place.
April 15, 2012|Fantastic! A definite must|5|Fantastic! My husband and I went there for our 25th anniversary and we were not disappointed. We both got steak and it was one of the best we have ever had. The side dishes of mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus were fabulous. The best asparagus we have ever had and the mashed potatoes reminded us of how our Moms used to make them; rich and creamy. The mushrooms were huge and full of flavor. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is pricy but worth every penny. Definitely a must for special occasions. I said I would love to go back for our 26th!
April 14, 2012|For the price food and service|3|For the price food and service was just good. Nothing exciting, took a long time
April 8, 2012|Bad day for Mill's|1|Service very slow to the point of making us wonder where the food was, or was the order forgotten. Food served barely warm. Was an embarrassmanet for the restaurant and just not acceptable for a place such as Mill's. Being Easter was not an excuse. If you are open, you should be ready to give your patron's the full experience.
April 8, 2012|Mills Tavern is a neighborhood|5|Mills Tavern is a neighborhood gem in downtown Providence, RI. Whether you are coming for Water Fire in the summer or looking for a cozy dining spot during the winter Mills Tavern is a diner's experience. The price is on the high end however the food matches the price value expectations and we had an exceptional wine that is not carried by many of the restaurants in town.
April 7, 2012|Very good restaurant|4|Always wanted to try this place when I lived in Providence. A very good restaurant with good food. Very expensive, but good for special occasions (or more often if you're loaded). Waiter was knowledgeable, food very good, drinks well-poured. Recommended.
April 4, 2012|One of the best of Providence|4|Mills always over-delivers. Our dinner yesterday, with four business colleagues, reminded me how seriously they take their food and service. The place has good energy about it, but isn't loud and annoying. Entrees are unique and fairly priced and service is outstanding. Their short rib is one of the best, and they take their oysters seriously. One of those rare spots that feels authentic, suitable for both a business dinner or a romantic dinner for two ...
March 30, 2012|Elegant without being intimdating.|4|Elegant without being intimdating. Great ambiance, excellent food (especially the swordfish), a little pricey. Only real flaw was rather leisurely pacing of our courses. Service was professional and engaging, but maybe the kitchen was working at half speed? We were there from 7 pm until almost 9:30. In and out by 8:45 would have suited us better.
March 30, 2012|My wife and I dine here regularly|5|My wife and I dine here regularly and have always found the menu to be fresh and creative. Their execution is always on point. The wait staff is very knowlegeable about the food and wine choices. This is one of Providence's finest restaurants

March 17, 2012|Perfect Anniversary Dinner|5|We went to Mill's Tavern to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. The entire experience was a superb. I had requested a corner table where we could talk intimately without a lot of hustle and bustle of other patrons etc. and indeed we had the perfect table. The service was perfectly attentive but not overly bothersome. Our appetizer of Stuffed Razor Clams was delicious! Our meals were cooked to perfection. I had the Braised Short Rib in Ruby Port and he had the Chairman's Reserve Grilled Pork Chop. Both entrees were to die for! We skipped dessert but were pleasantly surprised when the waitress brought out an after dinner dessert wine (on the house) to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. We certainly will return to Mill's Tavern!
March 11, 2012|The food was fine and the|4|The food was fine and the ambience was nice. I can't say that I was blown away; but I can't say that I was disappointed either. This was a decent, unproblematic spot for a business dinner with an out-of-town visitor. Certainly not cheap, but within our budget. As you can tell, I don't think the restaurant quite lives up to its billing as one of Providence's best. On the other hand, if you eat out a lot, it's certainly a sensible spot to have in your rotation.
March 11, 2012|Truly enjoyed our experience.|4|Truly enjoyed our experience. Pricey restaurant, but there was a prix fixe that evening so that a memorable meal, was had a price of approx $30.00 plus drinks and tip. Good bargain in a pricey restaurant...looking forward to returning.

Fine wine list, with excellent choices at moderate prices as well as more expensive options. You can't miss with a meal at Mills Tavern.
February 26, 2012|Lovely spot. Good food. Only|3|Lovely spot. Good food. Only concern was that we were clear with the waiter that we needed to be somewhere at a specific time so not a lot of time to waste. We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first 45 minutes. We finally had to push the waiter along to move things forward. Service should have been quicker given our direction.
February 25, 2012|Spot is trendy offering good|2|"Spot is trendy offering good views of city from window table we were given.....wasn't pleased initially by wait staff asking me early on if I would like ""a beer""......was dressed business casual, mature, and clean cut...hopefully didn't look the beer drinking type...waiter was talkative to a fault,suggested the porterhouse special that he felt was more than enough for two with sides....asked for medium and got medium rare (which I prefer but not so with spouse)...potato side was forgotten and waiter did not immediately return to check for which i was forced to ask another waiter to get our waiter back to table.... the steak was not an eighty dollar cut was neither worthy in taste or requested cooking depth.Overall decent but expected more."
February 25, 2012|Food was pretty good but outstandin|3|Food was pretty good but outstanding. Service was sub par for what you will spend.

February 14, 2012|Always Fantastic|5|The food is always amazing. I have never had anything less than a superior meal at Mills Tavern. I love the changing menu with the seasons. Portion sizes are just right. During our last visit we had the gnocchi and the braised short rib. Fantastic and a great combination when shared with your spouse. Gnocchi are hand made, light, and puffy, then pan seared for a crispy outside. Simply delicious. The braised short rib had wonderful flavor with the port sauce.
February 14, 2012|We had a fantastic experience|5|We had a fantastic experience at Mills Tavern on Valentine's night. Our server,Dave was extrememly attentive and personable. I would highly recommend it to anyone (maybe not with small kids). We will definitely be going back!

I had the braised ""Veal Cheek"" and realized after I was part way into the meal that they had omitted the meat from my plating. I should have complained but didn't. My bad. Another diner did not get a vegetable side that was ordered. She did inquire, but it was not brought out until 1/2 way through the meal. Another ordered an appetiser of shrimp wrapped in a filo-like dough. The shrimp was terribly overcooked and very tough. Mills Tavern is a fun restaurant to dine in. I'll try again this summer."
January 27, 2012|Went here to celebrate a special|5|Went here to celebrate a special occasion and we chose wisely. Cocktails were expertly mixed and all three appetizers and entrees were excellently prepared, served hot and in a timely manner. Two small critiques: It would be nice if entrees included a bit more of a vegetable side dish. Most things listed on the menu are used as a garnish, not really as a side. Our table was right next to a prep area which was a bit distracting. Next time, we'll ask to be seated in a different area.

I may recommend this restaurant but with stipulations on what NOT to order.
January 22, 2012|I thought the food was very|3|I thought the food was very mediocre. I came with a group of four and tried everyone's food. It seemed like a lot of fancy ingredients that didn't work well together. The plates looked beautiful but the taste was not there. Dessert was delicious though. I had the panna cotta. When paying prices like these I expect my taste buds to be blown away. My moms pork belly was definitely reheated.
January 20, 2012|Mehh|2|It was just alright. Maybe they were having an off night, but I went to this restaurant last year for restaurant week and got a completely different experience (my experience was very good last year). The waiter waited on us like we were children and she seemed annoyed/tired. The food was mediocre and very basic for the prices they were giving. I'm still trying to figure out why my individual carrot cake was cut in half. I'm not too sure if I would go back......

The portions aren't generous, but that's nice and after 3 courses we didn't leave feeling overly stuffed. I think it's a little expensive regularly though, so I'm glad we took advantage of the deal. I've heard their rack of lamb ($42) is amazing but sadly we didn't get to try it. I think I would go back for a special occasion, but it won't become a regular place for us.

Oh, and he hostess didn't smile and held her nose a bit too high. The highlights: the server was wonderful and my warm chocolate ""cake"" was delicious (oozing warm melted chocolate from center). What made the evening less than stellar: Another waiter added a glass of wine to our bill. Thankfully I looked at it - otherwise I would have paid $55 for $38 worth of wine."
December 27, 2011|Great experience and great|4|Great experience and great food. A little overpriced, $200 with tip for three, considering that one person only had soup and a salad. But a beautiful interior, spacious, warm and welcoming. Particularly enjoyed the rabbit and the swordfish.

December 21, 2011|Good with a Caveat|4|Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Mills Tavern. We were celebrating my son's 21st birthday which I noted in my Open Table reservation; however, the restaurant made no mention of that fact. I was a little dispointed with that. In addition, I wasn't completely happy with the table we were seated in. It was right next to the door. Luckily it was a relatively warm December evening otherwise it would have been chilly. Also, while the food was good, one of our entrees was served cold and had to be sent back. I should note that the restaurant did apologize, correct the issue and gave us two free desserts. Finally, it was a good thing we weren't in a hurry because service was a bit slow, although we really liked our waiter.
December 19, 2011|Liked the bread as a starter|3|Liked the bread as a starter however the calamari appetizer while tasty was tougher than I would have expected. The braised veal breast was very fatty and small in portion. For dessert the chocolate cake was very good however I've seen hail larger than the accompanying ice cream ball. My ice tea glass was very narrow and filled to the brim with ice leaving virtually no room for the tea! Great ambiance however if you are forced to sit at the round table booths it is very tight and uncomfortable. The bar looked nice but I did not visit it.

December 5, 2011|Great Food! Good Location!|4|Four of us went for my daughter's 21st birthday. Restaurant offers valet parking. We ordered the cheese platter for appetizer at $19. We just a bit disappointed in the quantity of cheeses for the price. Table next to us ordered salads and they looked great! I had the scallops - which though they were huge and cooked perfectly could have used a little more flavor. One daughter had the salmon which she loved, my husband had the filet mignon which was excellent (we all had some), and my other daughter had the best dinner of us all - the pizza! She could not decide between the pizza or the chicken and finally decided on the pizza which had duck confit on it - and we all voted her meal the best! Beignets & warm chocolate cake for dessert - great

We have celebrated birthdays, anniversarys, graduations, hosted business colleagues and met friends over many dozen of outstanding meals. Saturday night was a shocking disappontment. It must be noted there has been a change in management and, while some of the long time staff was there, we had a new server. After being seated we waited 10 minutes to be offered a drink and menu, we waited an hour for a below average Caesar salad. Approaching a two hour wait, not yet being served our meals we decided to leave. At this point the new GM introduced herself and was gracious and apologetic while clearly unhappy about our experience.

We even brought our own dessert because of the food allergies and they were great about it. Definetely would go back. Also, we were in a little bit of a rush and I told the waiter that we had time constraints, but that I didn't want our group to feel rushed. He moved dinner along without our feeling rushed as well as could be imagined.
November 24, 2011|We made reservations for Thanksgivi|3|We made reservations for Thanksgiving, got there early and were immediately seated. Should have realized the reason we were immediately seated, is that we were seated to the right of the front door which resulted in a constant draft of cold air and cigarette smoke everytime the door opened.Our food which arrived warm quickly cooled down. Also, the lovely odor of people smoking infront of the place didn't add to the quality of the food or ambiance. If you are going to let people smoke infront of the door...make an enclosure to separate them from the customers entering in the place. And BTW it wasn't business casual...quite a few people had jeans on. The meal wasn't bad per se but for $235 for 3 people I expected a little more elegance for $.

October 31, 2011|Third Visit -- and we will be back!|5|This was our third visit to Mills Tavern, and the first on a weekday night, when we took advantage of their weekday prix fixe menu. The food was excellent as was the service. Our server suggested side dishes additional to the prix fixe menu -- and the recommendations -- for the grilled asparagus and the mashed potatoes -- were perfect. This is our son's favorite place for us to treat him -- he's a student at Brown... Oh, and the jazz recording playing in the background (not too loud) was enjoyable.
October 26, 2011|Great find in Providence|5|Excellent service and wellpaced dining experience. The menu selection was varied and offered something for all tastes including vegetarians. Overall great experience!

September 25, 2011|Decent food AWFUL service!|3|Haven't been to Mill's Tavern in a while. On the way back from NH on a Sunday 9/25 and thought it would be a relatively quick but quality meal. There were maybe 20 people in the place making me think that things would go relatively fast so we could get home after a long day. They had some specials but we ordered off the menu. Meal was decent enough but the service was GARBAGE. The waiter could have spent less time trying to upsell us and more time doing his job. Every course took 10-15 extra minutes and he needed to be reminded every time by other servers that our food was waiting at the pass. Totally inexcusable for what they are charging and I will probably never go back. Avoid this place unless you have nothing going on afterwords.
September 24, 2011|Very very good|5|Great food and service. I had the filet. It was so tender and the sides were out of this world. We will dine here again!

September 20, 2011|The food was all very good.|2|The food was all very good. The service was absolutely horrible - extremely slow, even though the restaurant had very few tables - not full at all. The server was friendly but the meal took hours and dragged on much longer than necessary.

September 10, 2011|Overall the experience was|4|Overall the experience was a good one. The food was exceptional and our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Before our meal we were in the bar and there was a couple who had decided to use two chairs, one for a purse and one for a jacket. Even though there were at least 4-6 people standing no one said anything until I made one of them move a purse. In addition, the front desk person told us our table would be ready in 5 minutes and we waited for 15. When I went to inquire about why she had not come to get us she said it looked like we were watching the baseball game and she did not want to disturb us. She figured we would find her when we were ready.
September 4, 2011|We made a last minute reservation|4|We made a last minute reservation and luckily were able to get in! The menu choices were excellent. We thought the wood oven roasted chicken and seafood out if this world. As foodies from east coast abd west coast, this local Providence restaurant is a good find. They even carried my favorite wine from Bonny Doone.

September 2, 2011|Rhode Island's Culinary Gem|5|Overall, a wonderfully memorable dining experience! We do not often have an evening for dinner w/o the children and Mills Tavern exceeded our expectations on every level. It delivered on deliciously eclectic cuisine, a diverse wine selection, romantic atmosphere, impeccable service and a trendy city side location. I have been to Mills Tavern for both personal and work-related dining and it has been a positive and memorable experience every time. It truly is number one of my top three favorite Rhode Island dining destinations.
August 20, 2011|A Gem!|5|It was our first time dining here (but we wanted to go because of a visit during Savor Providence). Nice atmosphere, large menu selection, attentive service, white table cloths - it was the whole package. The food was great. We started with Baby Greens salads and REAL little necks. We had Brined Chicken, 18oz Rib Rye and a Lobster Dish. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I would definitely go back.
August 20, 2011|Always love this restaurant.|5|Always love this restaurant. It never disappoints. It is pricey, but you get what you pay for. Outstanding drinks, food and service. Love it... love it... love it!!!

Service was friendly and professional, the menu was very interesting and varied. Our selections were very tasty, hot and satisfying. I would recommend Mills Tavern to a friend without hesitation.
August 17, 2011|First time back since Mills|3|First time back since Mills was purchased and one can tell... The creativity from the owner is missing the food was OK but Ruth Crisp was better (never thought I would say that) - Our waiter was outstanding and made the night's experience worth the price.

August 7, 2011|My wife and I were thrilled|5|My wife and I were thrilled with the outstanding food and service at Mills Tavern, and especially with the value offered by the generous $30 prix fixe. The interior is pleasant if unremarkable, and the wide spacing of tables ensures an easy volume for conversation. We had two excellent wines by the glass. And, again, the food was straight As.
