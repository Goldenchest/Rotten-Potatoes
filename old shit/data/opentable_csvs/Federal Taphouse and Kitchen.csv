February 21, 2016|Great first date place|4|The place was overall great for a first date. The waitress was great and super friendly! The food was delicious and good portion size for the price! The menu is small, but I prefer less choices to make a decision easier
February 19, 2016|Great experience|5|My wife took our two sons there Friday night to get away. We were shocked/happy that we were able to get on OT with it. The server (wish I could remember her name) was enthusiastic and seemed to really love her job. The meals were perfect - do yourselves a favor and get the calamari app - the beer selection is really good. Do with they would have had one pale ale on tap, but that is nit-picking, as there were tons of beers to select - bottles and draft. On a street littered with Italian restaurants, Federal Taphouse is a must do.
February 14, 2016|The food is amazing as was our waiter Nick!!|4|It was the second time we had Nick as our waiter. He's so informative about drinks, food, and has great recommendations. Can't wait to go back and ask for Nick!!!!

February 14, 2016|Great casual spot|5|We made a last second Valentine's Day reservation here. Complimentary valet made it easy to find a spot on a freezing cold night in a tough parking neighborhood. Seated right away, super friendly service from Johanna. Good, affordable wine and great beer choices, excellent, high class comfort food. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back.
February 12, 2016|Friday before Valentines|5|Great place, they take reservations and the food and drink list is very eclectic. Always a good time here. Does not matter what you want to do, have a drink before or after an event, have a nice dinner or just have some apps, drinks and talk amongst friends.

January 30, 2016|Disappointing|2|We were very disappointed in our recent dining experience at the FK Taphouse. The food was under seasoned and every dish including the appetizers had under ripe tomatoes in it, the tomato seemed to be a filler to make the dishes seem bigger but it just made under seasoned food blander. The burgers were greasy and bland and the porchetta sandwich was a dry misnomer if I ever heard of one. Sad to see a restaurant that's in the same family as POB have such disappointing food and lazy waitstaff

December 31, 2015|Good stuff|4|Been coming here for a while. Always top notch. Great beer and food. Service was good.
December 31, 2015|Our first time there food was amazing!!!!! Love it|4|We know we were there on New Year's Eve, but some aspects of our service was slow. We had a 7:15 reservation and had to wait about 20 minutes at the bar for our table. Not that we are needy customers but it seemed that our server spent more time with the tables that had a bigger party. We will come back the food was amazing especially the dumpings and the lobster Mac and cheese.
November 14, 2015|great vibe:|5|Great food; great service; great atmosphere, and reasonable price. All combined with a fast and friendly valet service makes this restaurant an easy choice on Federal Hill.
November 6, 2015|Federal taphouse|4|Fun atmosphere, great menu with creative, but not unusual ideas, extensive draft list and fun cocktail list. Great service.
November 5, 2015|Wouldn't rush back|3|Food was good. Service was ok. I just wouldn't rush back although I will go back to try the burgers. I miss Providence Prime!!!!!
October 27, 2015|Federal hill|3|The hummass plate was great and no too salty and the breading on the fish and chips was to die for. The service was ok, could have been better.
October 16, 2015|Great spot for upbeat, casual pub like atmosphere|5|Very good and unique menu selections for food as well as drinks and beer
October 9, 2015|The service was good, but the menu is pr...|4|The service was good, but the menu is pretty small. The calamari was awesome! We had a reservation, but they sat us at a table right across from the door. They were quick to accommodate us when we asked to move further into the restaurant, but they were not busy so it was crazy that they sat us there to begin with. All in all, the food was good and the service was also good. However, the menu and place is to small for my liking.
September 26, 2015|Mac n cheese|3|We were seated immediately upon entering. We went because of the advertised selection of craft brews. Really enjoyed the special appetizer fried Mac n cheese. Srevice was a bit spotty.
September 20, 2015|Just ok.|3|We went there about a month ago and did not enjoy the food. We decided to give it a second try because we loved it when it was Prime. Food was ok. It is a huge step down from Prime.

September 19, 2015|Unexpected great find|5|We didn't know what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised. Great food with great service, fabulous wait staff all at reasonable prices.
September 19, 2015|Great place after The Dunk!|4|"Went with my family after seeing a show at The Dunk. Easy access, even nearby (free!) parking, and having the reservation made it easy, even on a busy Sat night throughout the area. The staff/service was superb all around - from the hostess to our server, even the busboy clearing stuff away- everyone really went out of their way to make us welcome and to accommodate two little ones just fresh from Disney on Ice! Some great cocktails, super menu (love the $1 ""Appy Hour"" raw bar!) and the food was fresh and yummy! Great rec by our sever to try the Bullit Bourbon salmon - fantastic! Only drawback was no children's menu, but they'll put together a very nice cheese pizza (not on the menu) if you ask. (See my note about how accommodating they all are!!) One we'll definitely keep on the list!!"

September 4, 2015|Middle of the road|4|From the review you may think this is a little more fancy; like with clean tables and cloth napkins. It's not. I probably should have guessed that since it's called TAPHOUSE but thought it was going to be better. Good service, ok chow, grunge music blaring, and plain decor. Good beer list. Not expensive. Not a bad find just not what I thought.
August 7, 2015|Nice place|4|This place is cute, very trendy. It also has a nice beer and mixer list. It was our second time there and will add it to our repeat list cause it is that good. Was so glad to see them as a participant in RI Food Fights fetus Calamari Throwdown. Enjoy Foodies.
August 1, 2015|Sunday lunch before flight from Logan|4|Stopped for a quick lunch before leaving Providence for a flight from Logan. Excellent food, nice atmosphere, and terrific service. Will definitely return

We also ordered two entrees that were delicious, one was a special. The last time we were there i enjoyed the Steak Diane but they recently revamped their menu and took it off the menu. I wish they had more entree choices instead of a variety of burgers and tacos.
July 24, 2015|Not good|2|"The best part of the evening was the valet service. We were greeted promptly, but several servers looked at our table as they walked by. The fact that at Friday at 7:30 the place was empty should have tipped us off. No one stopped, even after my inquisitive ""are YOU our server?"" stares. Finally we were able to place a drink order that took forever. The food was average at best and took 25 minutes for scallops and lobster roll. The creme brulee for dessert was awful; we didn't even finish it. Our server was missing for the entire meal, we had to flag down other servers to go and find ours. You can do better elsewhere. We won't be back."
July 13, 2015|Great choice|5|Loved everything about it. The food was good and reasonably priced. I had the lobster roll and it was a generous portion. The waitress was awesome. She was attentive and had a great personality. We sat outside and could hear the street music that plays down the block not was perfect because it wasn't too loud.
July 13, 2015|Just overall average|3|I was really excited but the place just didn't live up to what I wanted. Everything took longer than it should have. But the food was average. The drinks were average. Really just a meh meal
July 13, 2015|Good with Beer Flight!!|3|The food was good with some interesting menu items that are not served elsewhere. The beer list is impressive and a flight is the perfect way to try several.
July 11, 2015|great food and drink!|5|Love this place, have been at least a dozen times, would recommend to anyone!
June 25, 2015|Good food and good beer|5|Great experience at Federal Taphouse and Kitchen. Had the lobster roll which was above average and had a grilled Texas toast bun. Definitely would recommend to a friend.
June 13, 2015|Very very very good food. I had the ribs...|5|Very very very good food. I had the ribs which the meat feel off the bones clean. My girlfriend had the scallops and she said they were amazing
June 11, 2015|Terrific food, great staff, awesome variery|5|We were greeted quickly by a very pleasant hostess. Our server was at our table almost right away with a smile. We ordered a flatbread pizza as a started. Incredible. The menu has so many different options that there seemed to something for everyone (though not sure if they have any gluten free options.) The pace at which the meal came out was perfect, and the meals were delicious, hot and well presented. Can't wait to go back

Dined on May 23, 2015|Better than your average bar|4|Wasn't sure what to expect here. From the outside, it seems just like your average bar, with an extensive beer and cocktail selection and some pretty good specials; however, the burger was much better than I'd anticipated and the service was really great. Really great music selection and at a volume that still allowed us to have a conversation without yelling. My wife and I actually brought our 7-month old child in a stroller and the patrons were very accommodating. Wife, kid and I all had a great time. Also, this place is located on a great strip in Providence.

The portion sizes are large so it was easy to share and try a little bit of everything. Everything we had was amazing. The atmosphere is pretty great too. This is on a great spot on Federal Hill.
May 7, 2015|recommended but not by us|2|Our friend recommended this place to us so we hung out and had dinner with her at this place she highly recommended after just going there one time only - Appetizer: Sticky Thai ribs are saucy and falls right off the bone. I ordered Rotisserie Chicken which was moist and half chicken. Most disappointing was the Chicken n Waffles because the waffles were flat and flavors which made it too sweet with a cup of maple syrup it should be either gravy or syrup.

March 21, 2015|Up beat tapehouse|4|It was a very nice place for socializing with friends . the food was outstanding. We liked the Short rib flatbread app. and the baconburger and salmond burger were cook to perfection just the way we liked.

March 10, 2015|great rotating craft beers.|4|great rotating craft beers. Things you don't find most places
March 7, 2015|Bad Service|3|We had reservations for 8:45 on Saturday night, we arrived about 5 minutes early, but were not sat for a good 15 minutes, having to stand awkwardly at the entrance, while we could see that our table was ready, it was just not set up, and no one set it up for so long that the hostess finally had to. Once seated, we ordered appetizers, and then were approached by the manager and asked to move seats to accommodate a larger party, we agreed, but then were sat directly next to this large party, and could barely hear each other across the table.
March 7, 2015|NIce couples evening|5|We were looking for something different in Providence and Federal Taphouse fit the bill. It was a little loud at times and the tables are a little tight, but those are the only negatives. Nice decor, service was great, creative menu and good beer list. Would highly recommend and will definitely go again. Nice to have a non-Italian option on Federal Hill.
March 6, 2015|OK...NOT GREAT..|2|Went there after hearing good things from my neighbor. At 7pm on a Friday night, the restaurant was not even half full...that was not a good sign. The service was very good, Danielle, our waitress was attentive and pleasant. Here's my feedback on a few things I tried.. (all star ratings out of 5). Nachos - 2 stars. Thin layer of thin chips, little cheese, little chicken, mostly corn. Tempura Prosciutto Balls - 5 stars Excellent, crispy, delicious Poutine- 3 stars The gravy was way too salty and heavy. The fries did not have enough cheese on them Osso Bucco - 3 stars...the meat was tender, but it lacked robust flavors. I might go back for the Appy Hour. The menu looks good. It might be worth a second look. We'll see.
February 21, 2015|Nice Dinner, great drinks|4|Went for a quiet dinner before evening activities. Food was good, nice cocktail and beer selections. Even though the restaurant filled up while we were there, it was never too loud for conversations and the service never faltered. Would definitely recommend.
February 7, 2015|First time in Federal Hill area!|4|This place was exactly what i thought it would be. Nice atmosphere, good food and our server was very nice and helpful with the selections. The prices are moderate for this area so if you're taking out other people and don't want to get killed in the wallet, it's a good choice! For guys, the beer selections are great and there are lots of wines and cocktails to choose from! Also, i was waiting for a shuttle ride from the hotel i was staying at but i probably should have valet parked. The guys working outside were engaging and professional. I chatted with them a bit while i was waiting.

We also shared the meals so we all could try different items . The ribs were unbelievable. We also had steak tips and scallops. None of us were disappointed with anything. Dessert was also tasty with peach crisp, chocolate layer cake and cheesecake. Our waitress Candace was very attentive and the food was served on a timely basis.
January 25, 2015|Sunday afternoon|5|We visited on a Sunday afternoon and had a very enjoyable and relaxing experience. We plan to return again very soon with friends.
January 21, 2015|Nice place|4|We went durning restaurant week for the first time,the service was excellant the menu was great and the food was awesome
January 19, 2015|Truly Enjoyable|5|We had three staff members say hi to us before we even sat! Couldn't have felt more welcomes in this restaurant. Our server, Megan, was knowledgable and so entertaining. The manager came to check on us and he was also joking around with us. Our food, grass fed burger and scalops were out of this world delicious. We felt like the only table in the restaurant due to the exceptional service even though it was quite busy. Not many places still make you feel at home while dining but the staff at this restaurant surely do!
January 16, 2015|Wow. Bad.|1|I'd heard good things, but I'd never come back. The service was fine, but the music was so loud it was difficult to speak. The food. Oh the food. I ordered chicken and waffles with RI Maple Syrup. So the waffles were pale and limp - sent those back. The side of braised swiss chard was cold - sent that back. I think RI Maple Syrup means thick, heat-lamp warmed, flavored corn syrup. The chicken was nicely deep fried, but the batter lacked seasoning. Just awful.
January 3, 2015|Great spot!|5|This is the second time we went to this restaurant. The first time was just for drinks but we noticed the menu looked good and wanted to come back. This time we had dinner and really enjoyed everything we ordered. The cocktails were yummy, and there are lots of beer options. We had the pork belly and tempura mozzarella for appetizers and both were very good. The pork belly had a candied maple glaze that was a bit sticky on your teeth but still was good! For our entrees we had the pork osso bucco and the short rib flat bread. Both were full of flavor! Don't forget the side of brussel sprouts which were great as well. We didn't think we would indulge in dessert after a very filling dinner but we couldn't resist the s'mores option on the dessert menu!! We had fun toasting our own marshmallows!! Besides the food, the staff was great, our waitress was very attentive and was able to provide recommendations. I also want to note that they played good music during our time at the restaurant! Federal Taphouse and Kitchen is definitely on our list of places to continue to go to! Thanks!
December 31, 2014|NYE Fun|5|Great spot to dine for New Year's Eve. Great service and great food!
December 26, 2014|It doesn't get better than this place!!!!|5|Excellent restaurant!!!!! From greeting to sincere Thank you after paying bill everything was perfect. Waitress was very personable and provide some excellent recommendations from menu. Atmosphere was very comfortable and welcoming.....
December 22, 2014|Great Addition to the Hill|4|This was my second visit to the Taphouse. There are few places near Federal Hill that have a decent selection of craft beers. While the craft beers at the Taphouse do not rival a place like Julian's, they still have a better than average selection, with a much better atmosphere. Menu is upscale treatments of traditional bar food. Brown Sugar Bacon Flatbread was a very tasty sweet and salty combination. Coriander Crusted Scallops were cooked perfectly and were delicious. Wagyu Burger was probably a little steep at $17, but was cooked a perfect medium rare and definitely was delicious. This is an excellent change of pace from the traditional red sauce Italian places on the Hill. Enough television to watch a game, but not so much that you feel like you're in a sports bar. Definitely a casual and laid-back vibe. I hope they can carve out a niche for themselves.
December 19, 2014|This was a first visit and we were very ...|5|This was a first visit and we were very happy with the food and service. The menu had changed from what was published online, but our waitresss went to the kitchen and arranged a custome order. Our waitress was very knowledgeable regarding the Draft beers and was a great help in ensuring the perfect selection.
December 13, 2014|Nite out|5|Great spot for a nite out with friends. Excellent beer selection and house drinks are creative and fun. Upscale tavern food - good quality and great taste. Our server was so sweet and patient with us! We truly enjoyed our experience.
December 2, 2014|bhockey|5|Our second visit was just as good as the first. Once again, our server Bill was great, as well as everyone else who we interacted with. Thanks to Matt for the free desert. I hope I got your name right. This is quickly becoming our default go to place since it is so good, and close to where we currently live.

November 22, 2014|well worth it|5|The food and service where great. We had the lobster pasta speical...the ribs....the lamb burger and the tips. All great. Fun place. Only suggestion I have is get a table away from the door. Winter cold comes right in.
November 9, 2014|Great new place|4|Great food and service. Try the Chicken soup, the scallops, the chicken and the pasta dishes. Actually, I would recommend you try it all.
November 8, 2014|So much better than Prime!|4|I live in walking distance to the Hill...never ate at Prime...overpriced meat...but this place has reopened under same owner as a super cool craft beer/fun cocktail spot that happens to also have really good food!! The autum salad was delicious and really different. The cod was cooked perfectly and my friends raved about the scallops and said the carrots were roasted to be so sweet they would come back just for them! I cannot wait to come back and try some of the flatbreads too!
November 8, 2014|New Kid on the Block|5|Made reservations, but came early for the Happy Hour drink list and menu...awesome. This was a find. Then seated for dinner. Another great time. Wonderful server, interesting gastro-pub menu and atmosphere. We were not disappointed in either our bar experience or the dining experience. HIGHLY Recommended. Dine early...it does fill up!
November 1, 2014|Federal Taphouse and Kitchen shines|5|We dined at the new Federal Taphouse and Kitchen and were not disappointed. The food was excellent, The appetizers, especially the calamari and nachos were delicious. I had the ribs and they literally fell off the bone. My wife had the rigatoni bolognaise and found it delicious with the portion too much to finish. Our server Liz and the wait staff was very attentive to our table. While we were there both the dining area and bar were full with great atmosphere We will definitely go back again
October 31, 2014|good, not great|3|"my fiance and i were excited to try the new Federal Taphouse. we had seen the reviews and had loved Prime. my fiance had a glass of red wine, while i had a beer tasting. all the of our drinks were good. they have a reasonable amount of good beer on tap. the problem is with execution of the food. i had the short rib dish. while it was good there was only one piece of short rib with mashed potatoes and some veggies. for $26 i feel that the portion was extirely too small considering we were at a bistro pub. my fiance got the burger for $17 (grass fed beef) it was overcooked and dry with no condiments. if you are going to charge that much it better be great. it wasnt. overall a great place but prices are high for a ""bistro pub"". fell short IMO"
October 25, 2014|Work in progress|2|Given time they may work the kinks out of the kitchen and service. Some servers doing a good job. Manager seems very involved and concerned.
October 25, 2014|Visited for parents dinner over parents ...|3|Visited for parents dinner over parents weekend and hosted my daughter and wife. Food ranged from excellent to not so much! Brown sugar Bacon Flatbread was terrific, Osso Bucco was outstanding, Tenderloin Tips Diane was good and Salmon was a dissapointment.
October 25, 2014|Worst Restaurant on Federal Hil|1|Truly awful -- from lukewarm martinis to mussels with no meat to hard as rock calamari to paper thin burgers. Service was poor. The waiter laughed at every comment we had. He was deaf or couldn't understand English. It calls itself a taphouse yet the beer selection was awful -- brands that couldn't be sold in real taphouses.
October 24, 2014|First date|4|I went on Friday night and was on a first date. I consider myself a big foodie, and enjoy the farm fresh to table concept. The food was amazing, the beer was great, and they were able to honor my request of a table in the back corner. The one drawback though was that the music was incredibly loud......felt like I was screaming through the whole date.....made us want the check so we could leave.
October 24, 2014|Great bar|4|The food was terrific, but it was very loud. Creative salads, a great scallop dish, and great dessert (apple peach crips). Good for a fun night out.
October 22, 2014|AMAZING!!|5|Not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting typical pub food but I was wrong. The food was AMAZING!!! Calamari and sticky ribs were awesome and the grass fed burger and steak tips followed suit. Great beer list, great bar scene, great atmosphere. Finally a relaxed place on the hill. Definitely worth the trip!
October 18, 2014|Just ok...|2|The atmosphere is nice for a late night beer, but was not impressed with the food. The menu looks/sounds great and diverse, but quality of food does not meet expectations.
October 17, 2014|Love it!|5|Had dinner there on a Friday night with some friends. The food and atmosphere are awesome. Love the fried chicken and waffles and the sticky Thai ribs as an appetizer. The food is really exceptional. Will definitely be back very soon.
Dined on October 11, 2014|The restaurant was formerly know as Prim...|5|The restaurant was formerly know as Prime, The restaurant made some menu changes with less emphasis on steaks. The casual atmosphere was a nice change. There are many choices of craft beers, the appetizers were outstanding, especially the calamari and the Thai ribs that just melted off the bone. For dinner, we had the scallops that were done perfectly, not overdone. Service was excellent. We will definitely be back to try the ribs and rotisserie chicken on the next visit.
October 8, 2014|Great Menu, Great Atmosphere|4|"Went for lunch on Tuesday and enjoyed the menu and service, decided to try dinner and was not disappointed, we had the Thai Ribs as and appetizer and my wife had the Rotisserie Chicken was ""to die for"" her words! Great bar and beer selection. Thais may be our new hangout..."
October 8, 2014|Awesome new place!!|5|"What a great find! It's nice to have a more casual place on the hill that still gives that fine dealing feel. The beer list was impressive for a smaller restaurant and the food was absolutely phenomenal!!! I was expecting ""ok"" food but i was totally wrong. Everyone's food was amazing. The staff really goes out of their way to make sure you feel at home. Overall it was an excellent experience and we will definitely be back!"
September 9, 2014|Great|5|Our server was the best! Good food,good atmosphere!
September 6, 2014|Not the original Prime|3|Mixed review. 1st of all, if you are looking for the upscale Prime stake house--this is no longer the case. New ownership, much more casual; we were celebrating a birthday and expecting a fancier place. Food still good but menu limited. It was hot and the AC was broken in the entire restaurant somehow. The service was sub par---brought out the salads with the appetizer (pet peeve) and managed to cook the wrong type of steak for someone in party; that being said they did let us keep the wrong steak, the correct steak and dessert were on the house for their bad service so they at least tried to make right
September 6, 2014|Yummmmo|5|I have been to Providence Prime twice now and I keep getting blown away by the food! The first visit we tried the boar chops - wow was that good! This time we tried the shrimp and grits - that was amazing. Our entrees were delicious and plentiful portions. For dessert we had the tiramisu, which is the best that we have ever had!
August 21, 2014|Wonderful Evening|5|Started off with appy hour at the bar. $1 oysters and $6 filet sliders can't be beat! We had dinner and Kandace was our server. She was awesome! The food was excellent and the service was top notch. We will definitely be back again!
August 8, 2014|Not what it used to be|3|This place used to be our go-to place to meet up with friends, take out of town guests or just go out for a nice meal. I was sad to see that they changed their style and menu. Our favorite apps had been removed from the menu and several dishes had also been removed. The steaks we ordered were delicious and thankfully they still offered the amazing sweet potato hash which is our favorite side dish. I do liked the new layout which makes the restaurant seem more open but wish the old menu would come back.
August 8, 2014|Food was amazing...the quality, the prep...|5|Food was amazing...the quality, the preparation, and the presentation!
July 26, 2014|Great Saturday night out|5|Prime is an excellent spot on the hill! They've made some great changes to the overall feel and concept of the place and now it's somewhere you want to go not just for a special occasion but on a regular basis too. They recently updated their menu and now offer tapas and some amazing new entrees. Everything we had was fantastic and the staff and service was awesome. Highly recommended!
July 19, 2014|Great night out.|5|We had requested a quiet table and were accomodated with a table for four in a niche by the window. The service was great and the food was phenomenal. My son-in-law had told us it had the best steak he had ever eaten and he was right. The petite filet mignon melted in my mouth. We were able to have a nice dress up date night thanks to Providence restaraunt week.
July 18, 2014|Outstanding|5|Providence Prime is fantastic. From the Valet to the wait staff to the delicious food the experience its amazing!
July 18, 2014|Good food|5|The food and service were both very good. However, due to restaurant week the portions were much smaller.
July 17, 2014|Exceeded expectations|5|Wonderful restaurant week meals for only $29.99 - WOW!! From first courses - Caesar salad with shaved parm and white anchovies (requested) and the Thai calamari, main courses of 8 oz. filet and salmon Oscar (homemade Hollandaise sauce), to tiramisu and the best creme brulee I've ever had, everything was delicious. It was a pleasure to not have just an entree in the middle of the plate. Both meals came with sides of homemade mashed potato (1 was garlic mashed) and veggies (1 zucchini, 1 grilled asparagus). Tried Providence Prime for the first time. Will definitely return. Also, was pleased that valet parking was available. It can be crowded on Federal Hill.
July 17, 2014|Amazing!|5|My husband and I chose Prime for dinner during Restaurant Week. Immediately upon entering we knew we made a good decision. The restaurant is beautiful, service was so attentive and kind, and the food was absolutely fantastic! We had calamari and steak satay as our appetizers, both had perfect filet mignon as our main course, and finished with vanilla bean creme brûlée. Everything was wonderful! At regular price it is definitely a splurge, but they offer bar specials each day from 4-6:30PM. We are going to take advantage of those next visit! The only surprise was beer prices - more expensive than wine and majority of options were bottled.

July 15, 2014|Nice Find!|3|"I really enjoyed Providence Prime! A friend and I were out on a girls night out and were lucky enough that it was Restraunt Week in Providence. The food was outstanding and the service was great. The prices were in line with ""food on the Hill"", the only reason this wasn't 5 stars is because I was disappointed that the drink portion of my bill was more than my food. The prices for the drinks were not on the menu that is provided with great discriptions and I was in a little shocked when my bill came."
July 14, 2014|Not the same|2|I'm sorry but the last time we were there last year we had more of a steak selection than just the 2 that you had. 3 of us had steaks that were overcooked and not as juicy. We didn't complain because we were hungry. For the price it wasn't worth it at all. We brought a friend who I raved about the place to and he wasn't impressed at all. It was really unfortunate.

July 12, 2014|First Time Diner|5|Went to Providence Prime for Restaurant Week, greeted warmly by arrival and seated promptly. Very excellent food and great presentation. Waiter, Tyler, was great! I love the way they go out of their way to make sure every thing is perfect for you. The Maitre D was exceptional and the Valet guys were prompt and courteous. We will be sure to stop in again as food is delicious.
July 9, 2014|My husband I dined at Prime to celebrate...|5|My husband I dined at Prime to celebrate our 48th wedding anniversary. I can't say enough about the service and the quality of the food. We have never had a better meal anywhere. We left satisfied and happy.
July 8, 2014|Surprised|4|We have not been to Providence Prime in over a year and they have just changed their layout, decor and menue in the last month or so. The new layout is much more open and comfortable, the decor more casual and then menu is a huge upgrade and offered a great variety that all looked excellent. The meal did not disappoint, the service was ok and they were not busy at all on a Tuesday night.
July 8, 2014|Outstanding Steaks!|4|We enjoyed another dinner at Providence Prime. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Dinner was delicious, from appetizer of calamari to steak tips and filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The only slight disapointment was the gelato for dessert. It's texture was off, not smooth creamy as it should be, but rather like ice milk, could have been a freezer thing. Our server was professional and notified the kitchen and manager, who brought us a take home replacement dessert, which we explained was not necessary. We will definitely continue to dine here, both the food and service shine!
July 5, 2014|The right choice|5|Beer choice was excellent and server was very knowledgable when it came to pairings which is always a plus. Food was good, and the service was great.
June 27, 2014|Work in progress|3|"Overall, entree items were very tasty, attractive and fully met expectations for my wife and me. An appetizer, ""Colossal"" shrimp cocktail, as described in the menu, could be called medium, so be sure to ask for free extra pieces for that price. Server was not knowledgeable about the content of entrees - that needs to be fixed altho in (some) fairness, server was very new to the organization. We will likely go again because we have faith in the brand that includes Prov Oyster Bar and Springhouse on Block Island ..."
June 26, 2014|Providence Prime|4|1st time in Providence and found this place on Open Table. We were not disappointed. Food was great, service too. Would return upon our next trip through the area.
May 23, 2014|Great for group celebrations|5|This was all of our first times eating at Providence Prime. I had heard about it from a friend so we decided to check it out for a birthday party. We were not disappointed! The waitstaff was very attentive to our needs and offered some great food suggestions. The steak was nicely cooked (some pink in the middle), and those duck fat fries were awesome. i'd definitely come here again!
May 17, 2014|5 stars|5|The food @ service was excellent worth the drive from Boston.You help to make our anniversary even more special
May 17, 2014|We came to Providence Prime after our da...|5|We came to Providence Prime after our daughters college graduation...there were 11 of us including a 9 month old baby! The service was efficient and personable. The food and drinks was delicious and imaginative....over all we had a wonderful experience. We can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu!
May 9, 2014|good food|3|Went to celebrate a birthday. The food was excellent, and the service was as well. However, if you are looking for a quiet, romantic restaurant this would not be the place. Dining area is open to the bar and TV's on all night. There was music playing in the background but unfortunately you could not hear it. Tables extremely close together so couldn't help but hear everyone else's conversation.
May 3, 2014|Still good|4|They changed the menu!! They took away some of their best dishes. Rethink this decision
May 3, 2014|Unimpressed!|2|The 3 filet mignons were ordered were of excellent taste, however their individual price was way too high at $34 each. Their website stated the add-ons would be of no charge however, they stated at the restaurant that their policy was recently changed. Way too skimpy on the quantity of asparagus for the $8 price. We sat next to a party of 13, including two children. One adult was way too loud for this type of restaurant. The two kids were playing their video games a high volume level. All inappropriate. They need to upgrade their salt and pepper shakers to something other than what one would find at a local 24 hour diner. The music (contemporary Top 40 Hits) was a tad too loud. The alcoholic drinks took far to long to receive at our table.
April 26, 2014|NoComplaints|5|"Everything was perfect from the moment ""before"" we walked in the door. We were a party of four and we were all more than satisfied with the food, the service, and the relaxed atmosphere. Valet parking on a rainy night was especially appreciated. Best steak on the planet. Be sure not to miss this place if you are in Providence."
April 25, 2014|First Visit, Not the Last|4|My wife and I came for my birthday. The Clams Casino, one of my favorite dishes anywhere, might have had a little too much butter, but are still up there with some of the best I've had. I was unsure which steak to get, and our waitress recommended the rib-eye, which was a winner. It was cooked perfectly and was delicious. My wife is a vegetarian, so the chef made her with a tasty pasta dish with vegetables in a lemon wine sauce. The only negative was that we asked if the sweet potato hash was made with meat and were told no. After my wife ate a few bites of potato, I discovered bacon, asked the waitress about it, and she said it was pancetta. Very disappointing since it wasn't a secret my wife is a vegetarian (special meal request)!
March 29, 2014|Sub-Prime|2|Perhaps I made the mistake of not ordering steak. I had the short-rib pappardelle pasta dish. It was flavorful, but very rich, and I, therefore, couldn't finish half of it. My dining partner had the bone-in veal, which was excellent. The ambiance was so-so. At 7:30 on a Saturday the restaurant was 3/4 empty. Oyster Bar next door was hopping. We considered scrapping Prime in favor of dining there. Our female server was nice, but didn't know the menu at all. She stumbled through the specials, making several errors. Perhaps she was new. I ordered a mixed drink which was terrible. She cheerfully took it off the bill. I don't think we'll be back. There are far better options for steak in Providence...as well as service and ambiance.
March 28, 2014|Excellent|5|Got to eat here unexpectedly after thinking I had made a reservation at 10 Prime steak and sushi. When we showed up at the wrong place I checked my confirmation and realized Providence Prime is not the same place. Lol Embarassing. However we had time to still make our reservation. Loved it, much quieter than the first place and the food was excellent as was the service. Started by sharing a dozen oysters followed by fork tender fillet mignon and the best creme brulee ever. I am gluten free so this was perfect. The creme brulee had real vanilla beans. Embarrased by the mix up but loved this one and will go back. The hostess at the first place saiid we weren't the first to confuse the 2.
March 28, 2014|Great Food|5|The food was delicious, the restaurant was beautiful. The fact that there was only one other table with people was a little concerning for us, but the food was great and service just as good.
March 24, 2014|Great happy hour and food|4|We have been to the sister restaurant, Providence Oyster Bar, many times, but hadn't been to the Prime in a few years. It didn't disappoint, and we love that they offer happy hour specials that include raw oysters, too! Service was perfect - attentive, but non-intrusive, and providing a good suggestion when asked.
March 21, 2014|Birthday dinner|4|Brought my husband for his birthday dinner, as he loves steak and king crab and this is the one place that has that option year round. Our waitress was attentive and helpful, and made great recommendations (I was torn between a steak dish or short ribs with pasta and she pointed out that in the Hill if you want pasta you go to a different place). I had the bone-in filet mignon. My husband got the twice baked potato for a side and that was the star of the evening. We started with our favorite blue point oysters (which are also his absolute favorite variety) and steak tartare. Like I said, everything was delicious, and service was awesome but what sticks out to memory was the twice baked potato- go there and get that.
March 7, 2014|S' mores top of a great night.|4|Hadn't been here in 7 years but it will not be another 7 years before my next visit. The food was very good. The service was impeccable. We had 8 reservations and we ordered dessert before 9 and on a Friday night. The S' mores rock!!!
Dined on March 6, 2014|The meals were outstanding.|5|The meals were outstanding. I am not going to lie it was expensive so ask for a price before you make your choice. The steaks outrageous. It is a place to dine and enjoy your company, food and drink. Not a place to run in and out of. It was a very quiet night on 3-5-14, our friends birthday but even though it was all about her , it was all about all of us. Wonderful
February 28, 2014|Great spot for steak|4|Delicious food, extremely friendly and knowledgable server, overall very pleasant and enjoyable experience. My steak was delicious and those I was with all received their steak perfect as ordered. The sides were fantastic. Started with the garbage salad which is a mix of lots of different things, although the name was off putting it was pretty good although seemed to have some items that didn't vibe with each other, but overall a solid choice. Also started with calamari for the table which was very good. Overall a great dining experience, great steaks and staff, very nice steakhouse.
February 22, 2014|One of Our Favorites|5|Prime is definitely on the top of our great restaurants list! We would love to go more often, but it is a finer restaurant, we usually go on special occasions, or when we have a groupon. The staff is always fantastic and fun, and the steak is the best we have had. I love going to the hill, it is always a great experience. Thanks, Cindy Cooke
February 15, 2014|night out|5|Food was fantastic. Good portions. Leave full. Service excellent, not overbearing. Atmosphere is pleasant. Not too dark so you can see your food. The restaurant is not loud so you can have a conversation.
February 14, 2014|Ok for Valentine's Day|4|While I love Providence Prime, it is just ok for Valentines Day. The tables were extremely close together - more so than usual. You could barely squeeze between the tables to get sit. The waitstaff was completely overwhelmed. The Junior waitstaff did not pour water for us until we asked and we also had to ask for it to be refilled multiple times. Our waitress forgot to put our entrees in and our appetizers came out at different times - about 15 minutes between each one being served. All of the surrounding tables were given chocolate covered strawberries when they received their check, our table did not. Once the check was dropped we never saw our server again. All in all the food was just ok; too many reservations available for Vday
February 14, 2014|Not impressed|3|"My wife had the Cowboy steak and commented that "" she was not sure if it was beef"" it was. My filet was very bland. The service was average. All said would not return."
February 14, 2014|Happy Diner|5|You are never disappointed. Food and service are exceptional.
February 14, 2014|Never disappoints!|5|I've been here several times now and each time is consistent and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant and it has been on my top 5 list for a couple of years now. Nice red wine selection and they really know how to cook a steak THE WAY YOU ORDER IT! 5 out of 5 for me every time!
February 14, 2014|All around excellent experiance...G|4|All around excellent experiance...Great food and the service was excellent..
February 1, 2014|Great Food & atmosphere|5|Great food and outstanding service. Atmosphere was very nice as well. Staff was prompt and punctionual.
January 31, 2014|For the amount of money that|4|For the amount of money that is charged there isnt much atmosphere or ambiance. The main courses however were perfect! The creamed spinach was bland however. The waiter's assistant however started clearing and people were still eating. I thought that was done in poor taste and it was unacceptable. I tipped Michael generously as he was a great server.
January 18, 2014|Restaurant Week|4|Loved Prime!! Thank you Restaurant Week for bringing us there! So cozy and food was delicious. Great Wine List too!
January 17, 2014|Great meal!|5|We went during Restaurant Week and so glad we did! Everything from the Calimari to the filets and then to the desserts were soooo good! Bravo!
January 17, 2014|Amazing food|4|We went during restaurant week. We all had the filet mignon and it was amazing. It also has the best tiramusu I ever had. However, our server rushed us. I was still eating when he put the dessert down and while eating it he put the check down without asking if we would like coffee or tea. We would return again but would request a different waiter.
January 17, 2014|Took advantage of restaurant|4|Took advantage of restaurant week. Great choices and very friendly employees. Onion soup was fantastic.
January 15, 2014|We went for 2014 Restaurant|5|We went for 2014 Restaurant Week and just LOVED Providence Prime. It was our first visit, but we will definitely be back. The service, food & presentation were fantastic. George, our waiter, was right on top of everything and made some fantastic suggestions. We stuck with the Prix Fixe for the night, but will happily order from the main menu when we return.
January 14, 2014|Excellent as always!|5|I have been going to this restaurant for years and have never had a bad experience. The steak is outstanding...much better than Capital Grille!
January 7, 2014|Amazing|5|Great spot for date night! I've been to this restaurant many times over the years and have never had a bad meal. The food is always amazing as is the service and atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant.
December 31, 2013|Nice dining experience|4|The food, service, and ambience are all very good, but nothing was off the charts great about Providence Prime, especially for the price. You won't be disappointed as long as you don't listen to the hype about this place. If you like a good steakhouse, by all means give it a try. It's your typical small, (intimate?) Federal Hill boutique type restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation, especially on a weekend night. We'll go back, at some point, but it won't be in the regular rotation as it's a little pricey and more a special occasion type of place for my wallet.
December 31, 2013|New Years Dinner|5|Very good choice for New Year's Eve Dinner. Wait staff very attentive, nice menu selection with extra dinner specials. Very good atmosphere not rushed with a casual but classy feel. Moderately priced but well worth it. Will be back!
December 11, 2013|Prime in Providence|5|The steaks were excellent and cooked to perfection (correct for everyones various requests). All congratulated me on the venue selection.
December 3, 2013|This is a wonderful restaurant|5|This is a wonderful restaurant for steak lovers but I myself always have fish which they make equally delicious. The waitstaff is attentive and knowledgeable. This is one of my family's special occasion restaurants.
November 23, 2013|Delightful!|4|definitely a neighborhood gem. would like to return for appy hour!
November 12, 2013|birthday dinner|4|been here twice now. Both times the overall experience was great! WIll do it again
November 11, 2013|Fantastic|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our diner at Providence Prime. Food was superb with great value for the price. The staff are friendly, energetic, and efficient. We will recommend this restaurant to all our family and friends.
November 9, 2013|Wouldn't survive in NYC for a day|2|Ordered Caprese salad and the veal Milanese. Caprese: Mozzarella was rather dry, tomatoes of the super market variety = tasteless, basil substituted with lettuce. All doused in a sticky and overpowering balsamic dressing. Veal Milanese (on the bone): Chunk of fatty meat, thick breading, over-fried and soaked in oil. Parmesan for the arugula/tomato salad was substituted with chunks of mozzarella. Coming from NYC, I expected a large piece of super thin, lean veal, lightly breaded and flash fried, with fresh baby arugula, heirloom tomatoes and freshly shaved parmesan. This restaurant wouldn't survive NYC for a day. One star for food quality, but friendly waiter and decor allows for two overall.
November 9, 2013|Elton pregame|4|Went there before Elton john at the civic center. Waiter was great. Food delicious. Came out qui jam steaks all cooked to perfection. Would go back.

November 6, 2013|amazing|5|My girlfriend and I came in for my birthday and had not only an amazing dinnet we had the BESTand very friendly server(Michael) who made our dining experience that much better. I have already been back just to have a cocktail at the bar. Thank You for making our night extra special .
November 2, 2013|Not so much....|2|Very disappointed in Providence Prime. Took over an hour to get salad and appetizers. Then another 1/2 hour for entrees tomarrive. Had to ask for bread. Steak was okay but not for the price. Nice looking resteraunt, nothing special. Meal mediocre. Taking it off my list.
November 2, 2013|Underwhelming|3|Although our waitress was fantastic, it seemed that she was the only wait staff in the restaurant. From the moment we walked in the atmosphere was disorganized and rushed. The food was above average but not good enough to make me overlook the disorganized service. There are plenty of choices in Providence at this price point, and I won't be back.
October 29, 2013|Great steaks on Federal Hill|5|Prime Providence was a great night out. The food and service were excellent. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Would highly recommend Prime and can't wait to go back.
October 26, 2013|Awesome steaks!|5|Came here with my girlfriend. Smaller and more casual than I imagined but not in a bad way. Food and service were amazing. I loved the cowboy cut steak cooked perfectly the way I like it and the wedge salad was amazing :). Prices are very decent considering how wonderful the food is (^_^)!
October 25, 2013|Everything but atmosphere|3|Great food, great menu selections, expansive wine list, impeccable service. Just a room with tables.
October 23, 2013|Excellent dinner!!!|5|You will not be disappointed when you go to Providence Prime. I've been several times with my wife and the food and service are both exceptional. Try the sweet potatoe hash as your side and you will not be sorry. It is fantastic.
October 18, 2013|the service was excellent|5|the service was excellent and made the dining experience wonderful
October 16, 2013|worth the price|4|"Three girls dined. We began with a ""girlie drink"" and we sipped and sampled each one. We then ordered two appetizers to share. The seared tuna was outstanding and the stuffed shrimp were delicious. We then ordered wine. They have an extensive wine list and a large selection of bottles under $30. That was followed by rack of lamb which melted in your mouth - but the portion was small - and a side of delicious mushrooms. The only disappointment was that I paid over $12 for a ""garbage salad"" which was primarily iceberg lettuce with some interesting additions admittedly. I just don't think iceberg is ever worth $12. The evening finished with peach and blueberry crisp a la mode which was heavenly. All in all a great dining experience"
October 15, 2013|Not what we were expecting|2|My wife and I have heard great things about Providence Prime and were excited to try it on our anniversary. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype it received. My wife and I both ordered steaks and split 3 sides. When the best part of your meal is the chop salad and baked potato, I think that says enough. The king crab side showed up as we were finishing our dinners and the legs themselves were the smallest I have ever seen. Service was also sub par, my wife never got her second glass of wine, we didn't get additional bread that we had asked for and as mentioned already, the crab leg side was really late in relation to everything else.
October 15, 2013|Great filet and the service|5|Great filet and the service was outstanding. Our waitperson was super attentive and informative.
October 15, 2013|the Best!!!!!!|5|this resturant is the best steakhouse in town. Service is excellent. Quality! Quality! Quality!
Dined on October 9, 2013|YUMMY!|5|Everything was so delicious. From the bacon wrapped scallops with maple glaze appetizer to the dessert. The steaks were fantastic and I can't wait to go back and try another! Atmosphere was very nice and quiet enough that you can hold a private conversation easily.
October 8, 2013|What a great way to spend|5|What a great way to spend an evening... The food was fabulous! And the service very attentive...
October 5, 2013|Wonderful experience|5|I took my boyfriend there for his birthday because he wanted a great steak, and it definitely did not disappoint. Are table was ready when we got there, perfect location. Service was excellent, food and atmosphere excellent. Would definitely recommend Providence Prime.
October 3, 2013|Great place|5|Good rest. for food and service, excellant neighborhood
October 2, 2013|Nana's visit|4|started with the scallops wrapped in bacon and oysters rockerfeller. Scallops were cooked perfectly, and big! Oysters were average, but my mother loves them. 2 of us had the bone in NY sirloin special w/ twice baked potato. Steaks were done perfectly, and the potatoes was huge and delicious. Both were shared by the four of us. Fourth meal was the petit filet. Again done to perfcetion. One in our party asked if he could get a demi-glaze for his steak, and waiter was very accommodating. Service was very good, and not overbearing, even though it was not busy. He checked at just the right times. WIne list is very good too. Found a great Malbec, and they had Santa Margerhta Pino for my mother. very good experience.
October 2, 2013|Amazing Steak|5|This sophisticated city restaurant serves the best steak ever. Great service, cozy ambience, delicious food - what more could you want.
September 21, 2013|the food was very good, we|4|the food was very good, we only go to nicer restaurants my husband likes to eat well and this is a nice place for quality steaks....excellent service friendly not snobbish with a comfortable atmosphere....
September 14, 2013|Exellent dinner and service.|5|Exellent dinner and service. Steak was tremendous.
September 7, 2013|Close, but no cigar|3|Nice place for a good steak dinner... most notable is the wine list. However, if you want a comparable wine list and a better steak, Captial Grille or any other name steakhouse in the area is better.
September 7, 2013|Overpriced!|3|I don't think we will be returning. Almost $200 bill for my husband and I to split a special steak and my 6 year old had a side of Mac and cheese. The tomatoes in my caprese salad were pink and refrigerated. To receive those This time of year is pretty bad. Certainly doesn't compare to capital grille or Ruth's Chris. We love eating out And don't mind paying for it when the quality and service are excellent.
September 4, 2013|Another disappointment on the hill|2|Why oh why do people consider Federal Hill the place to dine? Start off with a wine list that has numerous offerings between $50-100, and many over $100, yet does not have the vintages. Duh! If you are paying $100 you have to know the vintage is critical. The waiter agreed that management is just lazy. Note that this is a beef place and only one patron out of 10-12 occupied tables had a glass (yes, just a glass) of wine. The food we had was anywhere from competent to bland. Take the shredded short rib with parpadelle that was just pasta with beef au jus. at these prices you can do mush better. Go to Cafe nuevo across the river. You will love it , enjoy a better ambience .
August 29, 2013|awesome food.|4|We had an 8 O'clock reservation but arrived early to have a drink at the bar (around 7:15). The bartender came back to check on me almost 45 mins after my first drink. I actually got my 2nd drink as my table was ready around. I was a bit upset since I could hear her asking others at the bar if they needed anything. I'm assuming it is because we were waiting for a table and they were ordering dinner with her. We had an awesome waiter who was quite busy but very attentive. The food was awesome! The filet mignon was better than I've had in quite a long time and the mashed potato's were to die for! Despite the less than par service at the bar we may try it again.
August 24, 2013|Not as good as I remember|3|I have been here a half dozen times before and it was always good. This time my steak was just ok. The 18 oz rib eye looked more like 10 oz. the taste was just ok. However my wife's steak Diane was very good. There was not one person sitting at the bar. So it wasn't a very vibrant bar scene. The service on a not so busy night was just ok, not once did the waiter offer or pour our bottle of wine. So it was disappointing. Not sure if I would hurry back.
August 24, 2013|Excellent in every way|5|Party of two on a Saturday night...we were surprised it wasn't busier. The steaks were awesome, service exceptional, prices reasonable. We will go back.
August 22, 2013|Excellent food|5|I would strongly recommend trying the 38 oz Porterhouse and the best part you can share it with your significant other. The steak was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth.
August 20, 2013|Great place for celebrations|5|6 of us went to Prime to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday---his choice of restaurants. We brought two special bottles of wine, which there was a corkage fee of $25 per bottle. The salads, oysters, prime tenderloin steaks, scallops, roasted mushrooms, broccoli rabi, and sweet potatoe dish---each one was superb. Server was very professional. All in all, a very good choice!
August 3, 2013|A great night.|5|Overall, we had a great. The bar service was timely and attentive. Our server, Sarai was outstanding as usual. The food was cooked to perfection and the bill was very reasonable.
August 3, 2013|Steak House with Panache|4|Though the menu has a lot of typical steak house fare, this is not a typical steak house. It's always a good sign when you have trouble deciding what to have because everything on the menu sounds so good. We started off with a couple of house cocktails, both of which were creative and delicious and that level of quality was sustained throughout the meal. The staff was efficient while still being attentive and friendly. All in all, an excellent experience.
August 2, 2013|Delicious!|5|We dined there Firday 8/2/13 after a very long work week. It's the best spot on the Hill for an Amazing steak! We've been fans of neighboring Providence Oyster Bar, and I'm glad we tried Prime, now our issue will be deciding which one to dine at in the future. Thanks for a great meal!
August 1, 2013|A little pricey but well worth|5|A little pricey but well worth it. Everything was great.
July 29, 2013|Quality|5|The quality of the meat was excellent. The food is alittle pricey. I have had steaks just as good for.less.money. would have liked 2 sides with dinner. The wine was priced very reasonablee, tbought it would be expensive
July 25, 2013|Excellent Steak|5|The filet was tender and juicy, and wonderfully flavorful. One of if not the best steak I've had.
July 25, 2013|Great Meal|5|We had dinner on Thursday July 25th. We had a 7pm reservation and we decided to have dinner at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and the service we outstanding. We had the littlenecks for an appetizer and the New York Strip for dinner. Bothe were wonderful. Both the meal and service were outstanding and it's a place we would go back to again and again.
July 20, 2013|Wonderful|5|Everything was unbelieveable. My 3rd time back and more to come.
July 16, 2013|Food tasted great, the steaks|4|Food tasted great, the steaks were slightly overlooked for medium rare tho.
July 15, 2013|Poor start- but good meal|3|We waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. The hostess came to apologize. Then when a server finally arrived, there was an issue with all four drink orders (no iced tea, soda was being changed over, and they didn't have either beer that was on the list). There was little flexibility on the menu (ie- policy is that you can't replace potato w a different veg). We were put off! However, the food was delicious from soup to nuts! I don't think we will rush to return. There are plenty of other places for a delicious steak in the area!
July 13, 2013|always a favorite|5|Love Prime- from the great seafood to the bar specials, this restaurant has a great atmosphere and delicious food. It is one of my favorite restaurants on Atwells Avenue.
July 6, 2013|No AC|4|So, always a great time but the new AC was not working so it was a bit hot in the restaurant and wished they had rented some fans etc to move the air around a bit...
June 29, 2013|Good Food, fun twists|4|Great steaks and wonderful side dishes. Some items are a bit different than usual (mac and cheese made with gnocchi). Food quality was great and service was ok. Service was slow on a night that was not busy.

June 22, 2013|Okay dining|3|It was our first time in Providence and we were looking for a prime spot to enjoy a fancy dinner. Food was expensive and the tables were close together. We would go back but it would not be our first choice.
June 20, 2013|Awesome evening|5|I took my special lady out for an evening and the waitress was great! She was very knowledgeable of the different types of meat and specials for the evening. Valet parking is compileraty which perfect! Bar tender made a sangria too! I would recommend to all. A little pricey but you pay big prices for big flavor.

June 5, 2013|Best steak this year|4|The reason why we returned to ,this place was the a good souvenir from the steaks we had. We were not disapointed . TRhe filet mignon was good ,bur the new york sirloin was sublime. The service was very good. The french fries however were as bad as it can get, over baked and way too fat.
May 25, 2013|Perfect Prime|5|Our experience at Prime was perfect. Prime provides a consistent dining experience with perfect steaks every time. Delicious.
May 22, 2013|Good food, great night|4|Quiet night out for anniversary dinner. Food was excellent and service was good which we expected given how quiet the restaurant was that night. Great for a romantic dinner...ambience was nice...an overall nice experience.
May 12, 2013|Decent food, awful service.|2|"We were one of 3 parties on Mother's Day. We had to wait an hour for our meals. Our server told us 4 times, ""your food will be right out."" It took so long it was as if the cooks went out and killed the cow from scratch for our filets. My side dish, macaroni and cheese, was bland and mediocre at best. By the time we were done with our meals and were asked if we wanted dessert, we were ready to leave and could not get out fast enough. I will not be returning to this restaurant nor will I recommend it."
May 9, 2013|Great steak and wine|5|Six of us ate here for a business dinner. Our steaks were extraordinary. And we discovered a fantastic cabernet franc wine.

March 25, 2013|Accommodating chef|4|Had a great time here. Shame that one side dish does not come with every meal--if you are hungry, the bill can add up quickly. Chef was very accommodating to a member of our party on a nutrition program--that really impressed my entire party.

February 16, 2013|You will not find a better|5|You will not find a better quality filet or sirloin anywhere! Bring your wallet. Two guests, a bottle of wine, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts with tip ended up costing $300. A special occasion, but a great one! Be sure to get the roasted mushrooms and twice baked potato for sides.
February 15, 2013|Good food, good people, high price|4|Pros: They know how to cook steak to your satisfaction! All of the food was delicious. The staff was great; our server had a great sense of humor. Cons: Pricey Small dining area No privacy between tables
February 14, 2013|Prime was delicious! Shared|5|Prime was delicious! Shared the special Porterhouse for two - yum! Salad was yum - sides were yum - everything great. I love Providence Prime. It is simple, but great.

February 12, 2013|A little half and half|3|Rib Eye bone in Steak was good- well seasoned and cooked to order - Short Rib with papradelle - bad news. gummy snarly mess and something a little funky. ( maybe past it's serve date?) Wedge Salad with under lying red wine vinegar --- WHO DOES THAT? so sour - it was difficult to choke down. Wine - delicious for 30.00 bottle. I would recommend for steak only.

January 30, 2013|This is the best resteraunt|5|"This is the best resteraunt that I have been to in Providence for Steaks, I recommend the 10 ounce filet ant the Sweet Potatoes hash is to ""die for"" it is an explosion of sweet and tangy all in one dish. And the mushrooms for a side for your steak - a must."

(22 bowen)during rest.week and they always bring the menu and actually inform you of same.I would recommend they not participate if they keep it secret and make you feel uncomfortable to order off it!

January 11, 2013|Great atmosphere, the staff|4|Great atmosphere, the staff was knowledgeable, and the food was fantastic. One of the sides could have used more seasoning, but the main course more than made up for it.
January 11, 2013|An off night for Prime Providence|2|i have been to Prime many times and the food is always delicious. Tonight however, my friend's steak was dry and flavorless. He said it was not worth the price. My seared Ahi tuna was average, I ordered it rare but it may have been a bit over cooked. The soy dipping sauce was delicious and made up for it. When making the reservation both on O/T and with the restaurant was told that the time requested was not available. The only time we could reserve was 6:45 p.m. so we took that however, the restaurant was not booked and there were at least 5 or more empty tables all night. Also the waitress was overly friendly towards my boyfriend and actually rubbed his back while taking his order. NOT PROFESSIONAL!!
January 10, 2013|This was our third time here,|2|"This was our third time here, and we have officially decided that that is more than enough. The food is decent, but not outstanding. The service is fine, but again, not outstanding. The prices are not in line with what was served. With there being so many wonderful options on The Hill, this one is a definite ""must-miss."""
January 10, 2013|Ok, but be specific with server|2|Unfortunately, we had a mediorce experience. Expected more, overcooked steak, wrong sauce on steak. Special entree wasn't what was described by waiter. Appetizers, both carpaccio and oysters rock were average at best. Oysters lacked a any hint of pernod... for the prices - disappointing. Our server was attentive and knowledgable, tend to think if he cooked the food it would have been better

IT SEEMED THAT THE PARTIES OF 4 OR MORE HAD GREAT SERVICE BUT WE WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY IGNORED. WE DIDN'T REALIZE THEY HAD SPECIALS UNTIL WE HEARD THE WAITER COME TO THE TABLE NEXT TO US. WE WERE ONE OF THE LAST RESERVATIONS IN SO IT'S NOT THAT THEY WERE SO BUSY. I WILL GO BACK AGAIN BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS FABULOUS. THEY SHOULD CATER TO PARTIES THE SAME WHETHER IT'S 1 PERSON OR 100 PEOPLE.

December 20, 2012|The entrees were really good,|3|The entrees were really good, but my father had to send back the side dish twice. The waiter took the side off the bill, which was fair, I suppose. Good atmosphere, probably need a reservation if you want to go here. Seemed pretty busy given it was a Thursday. Overall, the experience was good.
December 17, 2012|Good food, not exceptional|3|Good food, not exceptional steaks. Service a bit slow. Water glasses not kept full. overall a GOOD experience.Sweet potato hash was a standout. Excellent wedge salad.

The atmosphere was a little intimidating and the tables are almost too large; despite the romantic mood of the place I food myself physically distant from my date. Our service was very attentive and efficient. The food was very good but we expected better considering the price. Their wine list was very good and included a section of more moderately priced bottles which was helpful. Overall, I would recommend it but only if you have the money to throw around.

December 8, 2012|My wife and I shared the special|4|My wife and I shared the special bone in combination of Filet and Sirloin Steak very enjoyable, very good quality and cooked prefectly (medium). The restaurant offers a small local atmosphere which we enjoyed and it appeared the other customers did as well. Compared to a formal dining atmosphere that the expensive steak places in town offer and charge for. We had a nice Chianti to go with the meal. Most of the wines I thought were pretty pricey, especially knowing the cost of many and compare them to what my other restaurants that we visit charge.

December 3, 2012|Tremendous Steak on the Hill|5|My wife and I went to Prime for our anniversary. Our first time there was this past summer during restaurant week and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. This most recent visit was even better!!! My wife had the French Onion Soup which was excellent. I had the Wedge Salad which was the best I have ever had. Including a small amount of Italian dressing was nice touch and very tasty. We each had the 10 ounce filet mignon off the menu. It was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender. I love the fact one side is included in the price of the steak. I don't like paying for my sides. We will definitely be back for another meal. If you like great steak, but don't like being overcharged, this is the place to go.

November 3, 2012|The food we ordered was fantastic|4|The food we ordered was fantastic as usual: Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Lobster Ravioli, and the Porterhouse for 2 special. I would highly recommend any of them and will certainly order them again in the future myself. The service was a little hectic as the restaurant got busier. It seemed as though our table was forgotten about for a while - we were without water for quite some time and we waited for our food longer than the other tables around us. In the end though, the quality of our meal made up for the service! Delicious!

And our waitress couldn't have been more personable. Thanks for a memorable time."

The maitre'd knew that, sat us right away and the waiter was very attentive. The filet mignon special was outstanding along with the espresso martinis!!! We had great service, great meal, and was on time for our play. Kudos Providence Prime!!!
October 6, 2012|We were surprised on the dress|4|"We were surprised on the dress attire of other patrons, more casual than expected. I think that sent us a signal that it wasn't a ""special occasion"" type of restaurant, which is what we were hoping since we were celebrating our anniversary. Service from Niel was excellent! However, we did notice other staff falling short on service points to other patrons."

October 4, 2012|Providence Semi-Prime|4|while the menu was impressive, the food was not.... A $50.00, 18 ounce porterhouse should melted in your mouth. But it did not... The wine was reasonable , and the dessert offerings were very nice.... I would have to think twice before returning
October 1, 2012|Providence-Not-So-Prime|2|(1) Groupon is not valid for BYOB Wine Monday even though is does not state this in the Groupon; Theater Package, Appy Hour, Pre Fix Menu and holiday parties. None of these are in relation to the Monday BYOB. (2) Food was served lukewarm and got cold very fast. Steak and sides served on cold plates. Steak overcooked. Do not think we would return. Great potential, but it falls way short.

September 18, 2012|Great night at the Prime.|5|From the moment I stepped through the door way until the moment I said good evening, every aspect of the restaurant, staff and food was unbelievable. I was greeted warmly by the hostess and was offered several tables to choose from for our party of four. The wait staff was very patient with our questions and our lack of ability to choose from the wide menu. Food was excellent and wine was even better. One small note was that the Chocolate Lava cake was slightly over cooked, but even that couldn't spoil the evening.
September 15, 2012|Portions keep getting smaller|3|Portions keep getting smaller and the quality continues to decline I have been going here for a while and it's not as good as it used to be!

August 22, 2012|Great steaks - and the chef/kitchen|4|Great steaks - and the chef/kitchen actually knows how to make a steak very rare! We both had steak, and mine was very rare and my friend's was rare. You could see the difference when we cut in to them, and that's the mark of a very good kitchen and a very hot cooking surface. When I took a peak at the table next to us, one of them had ordered the ahi tuna, and it, too, looked perfectly cooked. It's also nice that one side order is included with the entree, yet served family style - no extra charge for sides.
August 22, 2012|Pushed our luck|2|This was our second time there this week. The first time the food was excellent. We ordered steak tips Diane and filet migon, that service was great and the food was excellent. On our open table reservation the service and food was lousy. We place our app and food order at the same time. While we waited our waiter was no where around and we noticed that other tables were already on dessert while we havent received our Burnt clams casino....horrible.. When we received our dinner only the food runner came over. The potatoes that came with our meal had Some horrible spices with it and the chicken was dry and rough. The steak wasn't cooked to order either. My wife and I both said we pushed our luck going back
August 18, 2012|I confess to not frequenting|3|I confess to not frequenting steakhouses, but I was not overly impressed here. We will not go back for the expensive steaks, but will go back to try the burgers and ribs. The Applewood bacon appetizer was very tasty, but a little disappointing in that the expected fat associated with bacon made it a bit chewy.
August 17, 2012|prime steak review|5|After two visits to this notable steakhouse, we have nothing but rave reviews. The steaks are prepared to perfection, succulent, juicy and full of flavor. The side dishes are impeccable, and their aged balsamic dressing for the Tomato and mozzarella salad are absolutely delicious. Though the wine list is slightly overpriced, they offer a myriad of options including my personal favorite, a Cakebread Reserve 2006 Chardonnay. The meal was paced beautifully. Diners did not feel rushed, but were not impatiently anticipating the next course either. Overall, it was a wonderful dinner and overall experience. Reservations are recommenede, the accomodated our Open table reservation immediately, despite the wait. Great value.
August 17, 2012|Providence Prime Nice but..........|3|Nice place, good food however, in my opinion, over priced. $28 for swordfish...........Could be a real gem but need to contain prices and reduce by 20% as the competition is very tough on the hill.

A bit pricy paid $12.50 for a martini but willing to ignore priceness because the food was good and I've been screwed in other places which were expensive but the food did not live up to the price. I may go back but it will be in the far future.

Dined on August 7, 2012|Wonderful yet again!|5|This is my fourth time at Prime and it just gets better each time. I went straight from work at 5 pm so getting a table was no problem. I ordered the New York Strip $33.00 cooked medium/well with a little pink – I am difficult with steaks, however, it was and has been in the past cooked perfectly! It’s nice for a Steak House to include the side rather than charge extra. We had the sweet potato hash and their wonderful mushrooms. The portions of the sides are large with plenty to share, the sweet potato was decadent and could be with a scoop of ice cream, a desert. Their mushrooms as always are one of my favorite and they do this simple dish well. I have always had excellent service and it continues to be on my list of top Steak Houses
August 4, 2012|Food overpriced for portions|1|Food overpriced for portions given. Front window seat was boiling hot. Not AC at the front window area seats. Horrible place.

July 24, 2012|Appetizers were simple,uninspired|2|Appetizers were simple,uninspired and nothing out of the ordinary. The cuts of meat (bone in rib eye) were thin and overcooked. For the same price, one can get a thicker, more flavorful steak (of the same cut) in most of Providence's other steakhouses such as Ruth's Chris or Flemmings. Overall, dinner was very disappointing. We won't go back.
July 20, 2012|Perfectly good steak restaurant.|4|Perfectly good steak restaurant. Steak tartar was excellent as was my cowboy cut ribeye. Wife enjoyed the lobster pasta dish but really a place for meat eaters.
July 19, 2012|We selected Providence Prime|5|We selected Providence Prime based on their menu for Providence Restaurant Week. We ordered off the $29.95 menu which was a 3 course meal. Everything was fantastic. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Overall, everything was excellent. I will definitely dine at Providence Prime again.
July 14, 2012|Restaurant Week|4|We went with another couple for our anniversary which always falls on Restaurant Week. We were seated in the front window which was nice because we had privacy and were not in the mix where it did seem tighter and noisier. Also, we could watch the sights outside. Both of the guys had the French Onion Soup for starters and the petite filets for entrees and raved about both. I had the calamari and salmon which were both very good. The chicken dish turned out not to be at all with the other diner envisioned...it was very coated and fried. But we made do and all the deserts were awesome. We left comfortably full without being broke. We did check out the regular menu and it did seem to be a bit pricey. We love Restaurant Week!
July 14, 2012|A nice evening for my hubby|4|A nice evening for my hubby and me. Excellent food and wine.
July 13, 2012|Nice ambiance and good food|4|Nice ambiance and good food all around. I ordered a filet mignon steak which was good; she ordered a chicken dish which was excellent. Service was a little on the slow side, but overall a good experience.
July 13, 2012|We went for resturant week|4|We went for resturant week and the food was wonderful...the waitress was less interested in us after she found out we were there for resturant week and would not be ordering off the regular menu....but I would recomend it to anyone....
July 12, 2012|Restaurant Week|4|We went during restaurant week and found it busy on a Thursday, but not too busy. Initially we did not receive the special restaurant week menu and had to ask for it.

May 5, 2012|should be Sub- Prime|1|Very expensive for very poor food. King Crab Legs were so small, I thought they were snow crab instead. The Manager disagreed, but did admit they ere the lowest grade of King Crab, instead of prime. My $43 rib steak was ordered black and blue, but was served medium well, and compaired more to a fast food restaurant than a prime steakhouse. After a discussion, the manager offered to replace my steak, by that time, everyone had already eaten, and I had lost my appitite. The bill was over two hundred dollars. Not worth a quarter of that. Will not return,and never will recommend this restaurant to anyone.

I especially recommend the specials, as they have a little more pizzazz than the rest of the menu. I thought that the decor was a little boring and outdated. The bar noise was intrusive to the meal.

I don't know why, but the service was not attentive as I am used to - perhaps it was because I was a solo diner? It was slow the evening I went, so that's not the reason. The atmosphere is on the trendy side. I guess if all you want is a good steak dinner, this place is fine.

Restaurant definitely not spec occasion/romantic and it is not just the casual dress. Steaks were very god, service very good. Music was TERRIBLE for dining, ruined our experience. We knew we would pay 200-250+ for wine and dinner and hoped to have a special evening at an upscale dining venue not a sports bar with games on screen, paper table cloths and blue jeans but apparently Prov Prime is marketing to the ""bar scene""."
March 7, 2012|Prime|4|We went straight from work at 5pm when they open so we were the only dinners in the restaurant with an exception of a couple at the bar. It did not feel as though it was only us, the restaurant is somewhat small so was very comfortable. Our waiter was excellent and attentive. I have only started eating steaks outside the house because I find most places do not manage to cook them how I like. I like my steak a little pink on the inside but with no blood – Prime delivered on my NY Strip 10 oz small – although a little charred on the outside the interior was perfect. Sides are included which is nice for a steak house, we ordered mash potatoes, creamed spinach and mushrooms as extra – the mushrooms stole the show. The sides are large and
March 3, 2012|Small portions but good food.|4|Prime is very small, so getting a reservation can be a little difficult, and showing up without reservations is not advised. My filet mignon was delicious and perfectly cooked, but menu options were somewhat cliche, with only what I would consider the steakhouse basics. For my one side dish I got the sweet potato hash, which I would Highly recommend. It was extremely sweet but had pieces of savory pancetta--yum! Some people might find the portions small since you only get one side dish, but I thought it was perfect. The staff was polite & professional, but the water glasses were tiny & they didn't keep mine filled at all.

My husband had a filet with an egg and LOVED it. I had the chicken milanese which I thought was an 8 out of 10 (if you wanted a ten you would have pounded out the chicken it was VERY thick and since its supposed to be a light dish it would have tasted LIGHTER if it was pounded thin). The service was mediocre. It was a younger guy and he seemed extremely shy and had a lack of menu knowledge. He also seemed to be at our table every five seconds pressuring us to order - and the restaurant wasnt busy at all - so it would have been nice for him to take a step back and ""evaluate"" the client (we obviously didnt want to be rushed"

The wine list is very nice and the oysters and cocktail shrimp were fresh and delicious. We then sat in the dining room for dinner. Mondays are ""bring your own wine"" night, which was exactly what we did. We had a fabulous dinner, I had a filet (which was great but cooked more medium than medium rare)and my partner had the veal chop. Very nice sides are included with your meal. We ended up having a wonderful night and a great meal for a very reasonable price. Would recommend and plan to return soon."

The garbage salad and the sweet potato hash were our favorites. The S'mores were so much fun. Providence Prime is smaller and more intimate than the other steak houses in the city. We all loved it and we will definitely be back.
February 23, 2012|Love it!|5|I have eaten here before and will again. They serve high quality steaks at a fairly reasonable price. I have paid much more elsewhere for a steak nowhere near as good. The free valet is helpful for this area; no worrying about where to park. The service was phenomenal; I can't wait to go back!
February 21, 2012|I went to Providence Prime|4|I went to Providence Prime on a business dinner earlier this week. The service was excellent and the food was very good. I enjoyed the French Onion soup as an appetizer and for dinner I have the Black and Bleu sirloin. The bacon was a little well done, but tasty. The steak was cooked perfectly and to order. I was too full for dessert this time, but I am certain it would have been good.

February 11, 2012|I have been to Prime several|2|I have been to Prime several times and always with mixed results. The service is always excellent so no complaints on that front. The inconsistency is in the food and in particular, the quality of the cut of meat. The cooking is consistently good but every other time, the quality of the raw product has been either superb or fair. I almost always order the comboy steak (bone in rib eye) as I did this time. The steak was thin and lacked significant flavor; not at all indicative of that cut of meat which I consider to be the most flavorful with great marble but no toughness. We took my 2 sons again this time and they had a sirloin and a filet that were good but again not as flavorful as we have experienced at other local steak houses.

The lights at 7:00pm were very bright and not dimmed for night dining and were so during our entire dinner. Tables for two are very small. The Restaurant was cold each and everytime they opened the front door. The steaks we ordered were not cooked right, had to be sent back while our sidies got cold and we were overcharged for a side dish even though we followed the waiters orders so we would not be charged.

The point Judith calamari was tender, had a light crispy batter and the perfect amount of hot peppers, very tastey! The second course was a 6oz. petite fillet. I ordered it medium rare, it was slightly over cooked and a bit dry. My wife ordered the salmon which was also slightly over cooked and on the dry side. The meal was finished with a creame brûlée and chocolate lava cake, both great choices. This was our first time at Providence Prime and overall it was a good experience although our main courses did not live up to expectations. We plan on returning to sample the everyday menu.

The pace the dinner was served at was great - we never waited too long for the next part of the meal or felt rushed. The food was delicious. The signature bacon with balsamic reduction, tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles was an excellent appetizer. We also ordered entrees off the specials menu that night - fillet stuffed with crab meat and sun dried tomatoes. I can't wait to come back.

The steak was very good and cooked perfectly. However, the lobster tail was not very rememberable in size or taste. I found the restaurant to be rather noisy and a little congested. I had better experiences here in the past, so maybe they just had an off night. I won't hurry back anytime soon.

You should reserve a table one day before (Tuesday evening was completely booked), they have a nice online reservation system.
September 6, 2011|I was disappointed with the|2|I was disappointed with the filet minon because it was overcooked and dry. I asked for medium rare. I cannot believe I paid $27 for that. The waiter forgot to ask if I wanted any sauce on it. The mac and cheese side dish was bland and I would have found it hard to imagine screwing up mac and cheese. The waiter had to ask for us to repeat our orders several times and took forever to bring our check. He rudely said that they don't take Discover and walked away even though I quickly pulled out a Visa card. The main reason the experience was so disappointing is that I have heard great things about Providence Prime and after my expensive, yet disatisfying experience there, I will never go back or recommend it to others.

I would choose Providence Prime over Morton's or Ruth's Chris. The price is comparable, but it is well worth it. They staff is accomodating and warm performing most gracefully under pressure.
September 6, 2011|Somewhat disappointing|2|My first experience at Prime; menu & wine list looked good, but prices on the higher side. My scallops were burned to the point that I needed to send them back. The waiter didn't ask if I wanted to see a menu again, simply put in t re-order, which we stopped, seeing that I was already eating half of my date's meal (which was good). Got an appetizer instead.

September 2, 2011|Not worth it!|2|I was really not impressed with this restaurant. The food was alright. I had gotten a lobster bisque and the lobster sauté. The bisque was alright, just needed more lobster, I only had about 6 little pieces in it and I was kind of disappointed. The lobster sauté was also not to good. The pieces of pasta were way to thick and very long to put on my fork, I ended up only eating 5 bites because it was so difficult to eat. Also, for the price, there needed to be more lobster as well. The pieces that I got were very chewy and not very appetizing. I love lobster, but not here. My husband was also not impressed with the food. Would not recommend!

We will go back, but will choose something other than steak and enjoy the sides and wide selection of salads and appetizers.

August 22, 2011|New Favorite!|5|Food was superb! Everyone loved what they ordered. Loved the gorgonzola mashed potatoes. The ambiance was elegant yet relaxed. Have tried several restaurants on Federal Hill, many very good, but this one stood out. Used the valet parking, so it was door to door service, no stressing about where to park. Our waiter, Jerome was gracious and friendly. The prices were a bit high, so I will save this one for a special occasion, but were certainly recommend to family and friends.

July 22, 2011|Dined at Prime in July and|5|Dined at Prime in July and again in November. Food and service were excellent! Everyone at our table ordered the small filet and they were all cooked perfectly. We loved all of the sides, which were large enough to share, especially the sweet potato hash.
July 22, 2011|Ok, but not worth the money.|3|Our Table was ready as soon as we walked in to the restaurant. And the service was fast on the appetizer. However, we waited about 10 minutes after finishing the appetizers to get our salads. The meat waas very tender but not that flavorable. I had the filet and lobster and for the price was disappointed the tail was only about 2 bites. Our waiter did check on us several times but never made real eye contact. Overall, OK but will not be going back.
July 16, 2011|Great Independent Steakhouse|5|Absolutely fantastic steaks! A nice local steakhouse that is not part of any national or regional chain. The steak was one of the best I have ever had.

July 14, 2011|All in all, a great restaurant.|4|All in all, a great restaurant. The food was outstanding! Even for a restaurant week menu, that typically lacks in flair, I was impressed. The ambiance was great, I loved the feel of the restaurant. The only real downfall was our server seemed very distracted. He was lacking personality and did not seem to care much about our experience. At one point he poured a new wine into my glass that still had the last bottle in it. In his defense, the tasting glass and the previous glass had about the same amount of wine in it, but it just showed that he was severely distracted. But all in all, a great meal!

July 1, 2011|Best Steak Ever!|5|Best steak on the planet. Blows the competition right out of the water. We have been several times and it never disappoints. Cowboy steak is worth every penny!!
June 29, 2011|Another great meal at Prime.|4|Another great meal at Prime. We were there early - around 5 - so the scene was quiet and we had great service. The garbage salad is always on our order list - and didn't disappoint this time either. We will be back, this is one of our favorites...
June 25, 2011|Prov Prime is nothing but sub-prime|3|Average steakhouse. The chef cut into my steak to check for doneness...that is a big no no!! They oversell and under deliver. The dessert was below average...not good at all.
June 25, 2011|As a frequent diner at the|2|As a frequent diner at the Oyster Bar, I had high hopes for Providence Prime. I was very disappointed. While the service was terrific, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer, which was not served as it was described on the menu. I had to ask for wasabi. My spinach was cold and had to be sent back. My husband's lobsert tail, servedd with the filet, was overcooked. HIs pear salad with gorgonzola had little cheese to be found. My bone in filet was good, and cooked to my liking. That wsa about the only good point.

June 18, 2011|Would go again, but.....|3|Could not have asked for better food. Our waiter was horrible, walked by us 15 times before he ever stopped at the table. Once we did order and then our good came never came back to bring more bread, clear used plates or to check on us until we ordered our dessert. Then to bring the check, now at that time he was very attentive. Would go back, bit would want our busser over the waiter.

June 18, 2011|good, but...|3|Our table was ready, and that was a good thing. Our waiter, however, was less than attentive. No smile, no introduction, and when telling us about the specials, was looking around the room, not at us. His continued lack of good service pervaded the evening. The food was very good, but as everyone knows, a waiter/waitress can spoil a what could have been a lovely evening.
June 18, 2011|Enjoyed our dinner out.|4|The appetizers and main course were wonderful. The side dishes left much to be desired. The ambiance was very nice except for the guy next to me who was wearing shorts and sneakers (but that is not Prime's fault). The service was fine but it was a little slow. We were in no hurry so the slow service didn't really bother us. I would definitely eat here again.
June 17, 2011|Wife and I ordered filet steaks|3|Wife and I ordered filet steaks cooked two different ways. Wife's meal was very good. My steak was average at best. Ahi tuna appertizer was mildly ok. The apperitzer also was missing wasabi which was on the description. My wifes special entree was missing the vegetable. For a high-end restaurant, parts of your meal should not be missing from plates, also meals should be consistant, and the service should have been a lot better. I most likely will not be giving them a second chance since there are so many great restaurants in RI, as in Alforno's, Cafe Nuovo, Basta, and many more.
June 16, 2011|Food was excellent. Waiter|5|Food was excellent. Waiter (Neil) was most attentive but not overbearing. Made some great suggestions and advised where to find the recipe for the great sweet potato hash side. A lovely relaxed evening!

June 14, 2011|Prime is an excellent choice|5|Prime is a great place to celebrate an anniversary or other special occasion. The food and service are excellent, and everyone deserves a treat once in a while. We went on a Tuesday evening at 6pm, and the timing was excellent. It was not yet very busy, and it added to the atmosphere and mood for the rest of the evening. The server was excellent, and each course of the meal was timed perfectly, we never felt rushed and we never felt like we were waiting too long for the next course.
June 4, 2011|Providence Prime is Prime!!|5|Every experiance I have had at Providence Prime has been nothing less than outstanding. My favorite on the menu is the filet mignon which melts in your mouth and is offered in a variety of ways and all are delicously prepared. The sides dishes that you choose from are an experiance all their own and are meant for two. Try the mac & cheese or the sweet potato hash. The waiters & waitress's at Providence Prime will make your night in the restaurant feel like your the only one there with their outstanding service. Providence Prime also has an incredible wine list. This is definitely one of my favorite places to be!!
Dined on May 29, 2011|Delightful dining experience|5|The atmosphere is inviting. The service and wine recommendations were beyond compare. The food was very well prepared - well beyond expectation. I highly recommend this restaurant for a special family gathering or relaxed night out with friends.
May 27, 2011|Perfect!|5|When we checked in they had a table near the bar with the play off game on as we requested
May 27, 2011|We get to have a great dinner|5|We get to have a great dinner only a few times of year, and we always find ourselves coming back to PRIME. You just can't get better service, a better steak, and a more quiet place for two people to simply enjoy each other's company.

May 21, 2011|Our dining experience at Providence|5|Our dining experience at Providence Prime was outstanding! This steakhouse is a perfect place for your special occasions. The appetizers, sides and desserts were exceptional, and the steaks were absolutely perfect! I have dined at many top steakhouses, and Providence Prime was as good, if not better than any of them. They have an extensive wine list, in all price ranges. The service was exceptional, our water and wine glasses were always full, without us noticing or being interrupted. The time between courses being served was just perfect. I just wish this restaurant was in New York, where I live instead of Providence, Rhode Island. If I were closer I would be a frequent patron for all my special occasions.

He claimed it was one of the best filets he had ever had and my tuna was delicious with wasabi mashed potatoes and bok choy. Our waiter was efficient but clearly didn't want to be there. He wasn't rude but didn't look at us while he spoke, no facial expression just went throught the motions. He wasn't worth the 20% tip but the food was excellent. Nice atmosphere and would go back again but eat at the bar.
April 2, 2011|This was my second time visiting|4|This was my second time visiting this restaurant, and I was not disappointed. The food is outstanding. The service is very friendly, and the atmosphere is exactly what you would expect of a nice steakhouse. The wine list is extensive and there are a lot of different food options for any budget. Also, the food is very reasonably priced for how delicious and upscale it is.

Small enough to be romantic but large enough to be great night out with friends.
