February 28, 2016|Frustruated|2|This is the 2nd time I have gone to the melting pot, and both times the services was slow. I get it is suppose to be romantic, however our server was slow to get our drinks, which was water. She brought our food first and then our drinks. The food was WAY over seasoned. The hostess did not seat us first, even though we had a reservation and we were early. She sat one couple first after taking their name, waited 2-3 minutes for her to come back, she took the other couples name and than sat us. I can see why it took so long for her to seat everyone, she explained the menu way to much, which should be the waiter's job. I would not eat here again, not at the high prices and poor services. It is not worth the 2 hour dinning experience. Even though the waitress was slow she was very nice and that was the highlight.
February 27, 2016|Date night?   This is not the spot|2|"First off - if the restaurant can not accommodate reservations, be honest and say: "" We don't take reservations"". 30 minutes pass the time is inexcusable and unpleasant. The notion of coffee with the desert means, bring coffee no later than a minute or so before or after the desert delivered to the table. Novel idea - cold coffee is unacceptable. Microwaving the coffee in the cup doesn't equate to fresh cup of coffee and makes cup hot, VERY hot. Food is OK, but there are plenty of places that introduce or have the concept of cooking your own food in hot pot with bouillon."
February 27, 2016|The service was terrible.....|1|Very disappointed when you spend $200+ for a family of four (and it's a birthday dinner..... although they don't do anything special for that it seems) and the service is terrible..... waiting for the waitress to comeback all the time, she couldn't remember who ordered what, then handed the salad plates to you (vs. Placing it down. Especially when I was on the outside seat and leaned back with an open spot right in front of me for the plate and she stood there holding it in front of me waiting for me to take it). Waited for our wine, water, etc... Just a terrible dining experience.

February 19, 2016|Disappointed|1|Awful service (almost comical) from Alex. Been getting worse and this is our last time there. And the stereo system has been broken for months??!! Awkward having to listen to everybody's conversation!
February 16, 2016|Wait a little long but thumbs up for gluten-free|4|I was disappointed to wait 15-20 over our reservation time especially since we confirmed that day. I mentioned to our waitress we were celebrating a birthday and no follow-up occurred. I was very glad that we were put up toward the front of the restaurant because I am usually seated way in the back. This was my first time eating there and being Gluten-Free. I was very satisfied with the bread choices selected for me. I also liked that there was a GF beer for the cheese fondue. The trainee waitress, however almost put worcestershire sauce in it which is not gluten free. I was a little sad that I was promised GF rice krispee treats for the chocolate fondue and then were told they ran out. I would still recommend this to my gluten-free friends because there was definitely care put into the separation of the two.
February 13, 2016|love this place|5|We love eating at Melting Pot. The only thing we didn't like this time is we were sat int he front room next to windows. It was cold out and we felt cold. The food, staff etc were amazing.
February 13, 2016|Great Family Fun|5|We went on Saturday and we had such a wonderful experience. Our server Scott was great I would recommend the melting pot and plan on going soon

When two people walk into an empty restaurant they should be seated at first available and not stuck in the back with the weirdly shaped tables. Otherwise food was good and our waitress was very pleasant.
February 12, 2016|What a great night!!!|5|The melting pot was a great experience. Me and my girlfriend loved it, it is our number one go to on special occasions. Great staff and service we will be back! Greatly recommended!!
January 30, 2016|We have gone to the restaurant in Framin...|2|We have gone to the restaurant in Framingham a number of times over the years and the experience was always positive, the service and food were always very good. The service was so bad at the Providence location that it detracted from the overall experience, turning what should have been a positive experience with the good food to an overall negative experience that evening.
January 23, 2016|Excellent Service|5|We were a party of 3, and new to the experience. Our server was amazing and explained everything clear and concise. We will definitely go back when we are in the area but it can be a bit pricey but for those special occasions it was worth it.
January 22, 2016|Always tasty food!|5|The Melting Pot in Providence is very nice as most are. The atmosphere is always enjoyable and the staff was very nice and happy. The convenience of the mall makes parking and staying indoors very welcomed on cold days. The only negative I had regarding this MP was the bar service was pretty poor. they made a few drinks the wrong way and that was disappointing. Especially when you are paying a premium. MPs are not ideal for children under 10ish. There is raw food on he table and of course there is very hot surfaces and objects within reach. Just have your eyes taped open!!! Enjoy!!
January 16, 2016|Our waiter and our bus boy were absolute...|4|Our waiter and our bus boy were absolutely fantastic. They had us laughing our heads off and completely relaxed by the end of our nights. My friend and I went out for a girls night and we have not left so happy in a long time. Thank you very much for the wonderful evening formation mark
January 10, 2016|So so|3|We were sat in atop near the bar with no other patrons. They closed the doors to this room. There were quite a few other diners in the main area. Food was average , whiskey bbq pork was overly salty. We could hear our server talking in the bar to someone.
January 10, 2016|Great food okay service|4|"My wife and I have been dining here about 4-5 times a year for nearly 6 years now. The quality of the food is always top notch and it is hard to find any fault with the menu options. The part of the meal that really makes or breaks the entire experience is your waiter or waitress. Since they are preparing the cheese and chocolate ( in the case of smores or banana fosters ) fondue at your table they are an important part of the meal. This past trip my wife and I ordered the buffalo cheese fondue. While our waiter prepared the cheese and made small talk I noticed that there was no hot sauce. He apologized and came back with hot sauce and shallots to add to the fondue. It was okay but didn't taste quite right. After reviewing the menu I'm fairly certain he prepared the cheddar fondue and then added the hot sauce and shallots instead of removing the wrong food and remaking it correctly. Our cooking style, Mojo, typically has parts added to it at the table such as an orange being squeezed into it. This didn't happen and the style had much less flavor than normal leading me to believe our waiter neglected this part of the meal as well. Lastly we asked about ""dessert"" coffees as there is normally a page in the dessert menu devoted to after dinner alcoholic coffee. Our waiter stated he was unfamiliar with those drinks and would look into it. He returned with our chocolate fondue and a list of drink names but no knowledge of what was in said drinks. This was a very atypical meal normally the wait staff ,including the bussers, are phenomenal and greatly enhance the dining experience. However, it serves to illustrate just how integral to the dining experience the wait staff is in this setting."
January 7, 2016|Best Waiter To Date|5|With this style of restaurant, the wait staff has to be excellent to make the experience great. Fortunately, we had the best waiter. He put in 1005 to make sure we had the best experience possible. By the end of the dinner I considered him a friend (not really but you get the idea)! The food, presentation, and drink list were perfect. I would come back again and recommend to anyone.
January 1, 2016|Amazing food|4|I absolutely love the food. The radio or cd player was broken so it was extremely quiet and you could hear other people's conversations. There was either a waiter or a bus boy that was a little too loud but that was ok. We waited a little too long for the main course but other than that I am still a huge fan of the melting pot. We go there atleast one to two times a year and it never disappoints us. Highly recommended for a romantic night out.

December 18, 2015|It was ok.|3|It was pricey for the quality of food and portion size. There are many more interesting restaurants in Providence. Children like this place.
December 16, 2015|Somewhat dissappointing|3|It had been a long time since we dined at melting pot and both my wife and I were really looking foward to our reservation. We both felt somewhat disappointed after doing so for the following reasons: we were placed on the second floor where we thought it was somewhat dark and gloomy. We both ordered the 4 course meal. The cheddar cheese was not hot, and was luke warm at best. I thought for the amount of chicken, steak,shrimp we received it was somewhat overpriced. Our waiter brought our broth to cook our meat and it had to be boiling for 20 mins before he actually delivered our main course. From the time we were seated until we finished was over 2 hrs. I will say the desert was good as we had a white and dark chocolate. We were so exited about our night out at the melting pot, and it did not live up to the hype for us sadly

November 14, 2015|Very interesting concept|5|Came here on a first date just looking to try something new. Totally awesome, I didn't realize that I was cooking my own food which just made it even more interesting. The menu pricing can be deceiving when you first look at it. How they have the prices laid out in the menu makes it seem less expensive than it really is. I had a blast though and so did my date and we plan on returning as soon as we can.
November 14, 2015|What a great experience. Reservations fo...|5|"What a great experience. Reservations for 6:00pm for 2 made through open table. Seated in a section for quiet conversation with little interruption. Our server Brandon was excellent. Great sense of humor while helping us make selections. Learning a little bit about his customer as we went along. My boyfriend was not the least bit interested in ""cooking my own meal i'm going to pay $100 for""....he's a changed man and asked when our next visit would be. It was delightful and can't wait to go again. His co-workers often checked our table with as much enthusiasm. The food was delicious and it was nice to spend 2 hours of chatting alone in a quiet place. Can't wait to go back!"
November 11, 2015|Fun interactive dinner!|5|If you are someone who wants to simply order food, eat and then leave, this place is not for you. Dinner takes about 2 hours here. There are 3 or 4 courses and all are interactive, dipping and cooking your food. So much fun! The cheddar cheese fondue with bread and vegetables was our first course, then regular salads, then the vegetable broth that you cook your platter of meats in, then the grand finale (chocolate fondue!!). Oh my god, make sure you leave room for chocolate fondue because it's amazing. We had the yin and yang one which was dark and white chocolate together. This is a very entertaining experience but you do need to agree on what type of cheese and chocolate fondues you pick as there is only one stove and pot on the tables for two. Menu was quite complicated to figure out for a first timer but now that I know what it's like I can't wait to go back!
November 8, 2015|Less than expected|3|"We were surprised to find out that the main entrée was served raw and it was our ""Job"" to cook it on the table top pot(s). We tried the 4 course dinner and for the $40+ per person we were sorry we did. We thought that we started with cheese fondue with meats and such included, but that little lunch meat was extra, and the included cold apple slices, soft cold bread pieces and carrots didn't complement the melted buffalo cheese very well at all. They should have had small chunks of cooked chicken to dip in, perhaps so salsa chips, or something! but soft cold bread, and such was a terrible mix. Then we did enjoy the house salad and house dressing. We then expected a cooked filet and lobster tail to be followed by another fondue pot of hot melted chocolate for dessert, but instead we were served a small raw lobster tail, and about 4-6 oz total of the filet and duck. We had to place small pieces on skewers and place in hot pot filled with seasoned broth for a few minutes for each piece. So while it was ok for the first few pieces but the novelty quickly wore off and dinner out became a chore instead. Don't drink or you might forget something in the pot way too long! Anyway, last was the chocolate fondue which was the best part. Served with fruits, and brownie bites, and mashmellows, etx, it was a fun and good tasting dessert. Don't know if we will ever go back, but if we do it's only because the wait staff, and the manager in particular were very friendly and helpful. If we do go back, we will skip the cheese. Might be willing to cook one entrée and share it, as that is more than enough work, and then enjoy a good dessert!"
November 7, 2015|Not a typical visit|1|Our reservation was at 8 and like others with reservations we waited quite some time to get seated. Then waited about 20 for a waitress to appear. Food was great as always but we didn't even get our dessert until 11pm!!! I don't know if it was the waitress or kitchen but it was really late. Our waitress would not stop coming to our table and talking to us for very long periods of time. Although she was nice it was still very annoying.
November 7, 2015|Melting Pot - First timers|5|I took 2 of my daughters to the Melting Pot. It was our first time. Providence was a very crowded city this day. I had a reservation for 6pm. The front desk employees were very courteous to all. We were seated at 6:15. Our waiter was Billy. Very friendly and helpful. The menu was a bit confusing for those of us who have never been. We did the 4 course meal which was pricey for us. It was delicious but way too much food. I don't believe I would do that many courses again. Overall a very enjoyable evening.
November 7, 2015|great place for a date|4|Be ready to open your wallet. Prices on the high side but it's a cool experience and a great place for a date.
November 7, 2015|Excellent food and service|5|Had en excellent experience. Our waiter Billy was great, food was awesome, atmosphere is great for a romantic evening
November 7, 2015|Yummy!|5|The staff was wonderful and the manager checked up on us during the meal (love that). The food is great. Love the house dressing. You can even buy it. Don't miss out on this great experience.
October 17, 2015|Service is slow-or maybe just the server|3|Pushed back the reservation until 6:15, coming with young kids from CT to celebrate a friend's birthday. Not seated until after 7 or 7:15, then noone came to the table until closer to 8. By then we were ready to leave and go to McDonalds :( Finally someone came but the water ran out of the pots by the time we got our drinks (another 20 minutes). The server seemed frazzled-maybe new? I don't know. Fun experience for the concept but execution was not all there.
October 13, 2015|Even though I used open table during the...|5|Even though I used open table during the week, knowing it would not be busy. It was easy and quick to use knowing we had plans in writing for our anniversary. Was not a lot of people, it was quiet. Sat us at large table so we had access to two plots, that was nice. Had the 4 course meal, something we had 8 years ago on a pre honeymoon. Service was outstanding.i think the guy was the bartender, but I liked his style of service. Food was good, but nothing like mouth watering that I couldn't get enough.
October 11, 2015|Got a bit slighted|4|We love going to TMP and go frequently. However, this visit we got a bit slighted on portions. Our salads were tiny and were missing croutons. We asked for more mushrooms and were brought only 4. We asked for more Rice Krispies and were only brought 4 and we had a lot of chocolate left! It wasn't our best visit which was disappointing since it was our wedding anniversary.
October 10, 2015|Melting Pot Providence Place|4|The food, as always was excellent. We sat in the front room, closest to the from desk. I prefer to sit in the back room, but I'm not too picky. Our waitress was very nice and friendly, but I found the service this time to be a bit slower than usual. I've never had a bad experience with the food or the staff at any Melting Pot, and would continue to recommend it to a friend. It was also very easy to make a reservation online.
October 10, 2015|Food an experience is|4|Food and fondue experience is great. Very unique. Our only problem was the waiter seemed very scattered. It was a 3 hour dinner due to long wait times and our ordered being misplaced. He also let our water in the fondue pot run out and smoke started coming out of the pot.
October 3, 2015|Busy event night|3|We have visited Melting Pots across the country. I am not sure this one was ready to handle the crowd of a Waterfire Event night. Service was extremely slow and servers were MIA a lot. Our entree pot mostly evaporated before the food arrived at our table. I had ordered a wine flight and had to remind our server to bring each glass, which usually arrived half way through the food course. The food was wonderful and up to Melting Pot standards. The noise level was very loud but that was due to loud teenagers in a booth near us. I think on a normal night the experience would have been better.

Dined on August 30, 2015|Its more for the novelty than the food.|4|Food was good with nice presentation. But a lot of the success is in the novelty of dipping and cooking your own food in cheese, then broth/oil, then chocolate. Servers are nice but make simple mistakes. One filled my date's drink with water before we could stop him, but she was drinking sprite and there was still a quarter glass left. It was also not for a high school or college student's budget. 40-50$ a person.
August 28, 2015|Love Dinner at the Melting Pot|5|The Melting Pot is such a great special occasion or group dining venue. We came with six high school juniors to enjoy an end-of-summer shopping and dinner event at the Providence Place Mall. We spent as long at dinner as we did shopping. The Melting Pot is designed for you to linger but it's never boring because you're involved with cooking your food in the fondue pots. Everything was great but we all loved the chocolate fondues for dessert. Our server, Ben, was great too. We were his only table as he was also the bartender, so we had a lot of personal attention. Please say thank you to him for the great service. Would love to go back with adults to sample the wonderful sounding cocktails.

August 26, 2015|Great atmosphere|5|If your looking for a different dining experience, this is the place to go.
August 22, 2015|NIce Date Night|3|Food was great, service was unbearably slow. Our waiter was great, I think they just need to hire more people. Dinner should not take more than 2 hours.
August 21, 2015|Awesome place for a night out with friends !|5|They have an awesome menu, it can get a bit pricey but deff worth it. I would recommended the 4 course meal. First, They make the fondue right at your table, then the beautiful and delicious but small salads come. Then onto the main course, everything is portioned sized and brought to your table raw ! Where you then cook yourself in the stepping broths on your hot plate. Now after playing a bit with your dinner, the final course comes a flaming pot of hot chocolate fondue. Defiantly best date night, or for a fun night out with your buddys

August 1, 2015|Amazing food, bad service|3|our food was amazing! But the service was terrible. Our server would disappear for 30 min increments and would forget things that we asked for. At one point between the main course and dessert we sat at an empty table for over 30 mins with the manager passing us several times and never stopping to check on us
July 31, 2015|Would definitely dine here again.|4|Our dinner experience was wonderful thanks to our waiter Alex. Courses were well spaced out giving our party the chance to pace our dining and engage in quality conversation. Food tasted great and the style of eating was fun. The only complaint I have is issues with paying the bill. My card was ran twice which put a hold on my account for twice the amount of the bill. When I called, the manager was highly responsive to my issue and did her best looking into the matter. Overall a joyous dining experience.
July 25, 2015|Ok visit|4|Not the typical visit but still ok. Table near us was very loud. Service seemed rushed. No offee for extra stuff to dip once we ran out and still had cheese and chocolate
July 18, 2015|Super Food and Super Fun!|5|Awesome place for a special occasion or just for fun. LOVE the fondue concept! The wait staff is very helpful and explains the menu and process. The variety of food was excellent, as was the quality and freshness of everything presented. Be sure to leave plenty of time to relax and enjoy....not a place to rush through.
July 8, 2015|Dinner|4|It was nice. A different experience. More expensive than I expected, so I would only go again for a special occasion.
July 6, 2015|Melting pot regulars- around the world!|2|Took friends for thier first experience and boasted about the service we always receive. This time it was different. Our server was friendly, but we were left for long periods without drink refills, weren't offered refills on our sauces because they didn't come back in time for us to have any food left to get more sauce. It wasn't like our usual experiences we have had. Food was great as per always but the service was disappointing.
July 3, 2015|Not what it used to be|2|We used to love going to The Melting Pot but it sure is not what it used to be. The hostess asked me to step back while she finished seating several other parties (totally understandable) and then she forgot about us and seated another party ahead of us. This other party did not even have a reservation and we did. Our server put forth some effort to be pleasant but you could tell she did not want to be there. So far as the food itself, the cheese and chocolate fondue were so thin and the flavors were just bland. Our Flaming Turtle dessert was a weak blue match strike at best. The food did come fast - almost too fast - and we felt rather rushed. The table bussers were constantly trying to take our plates before we were finished. It will be a long time before we attempt another fondue fiesta. :(
June 26, 2015|Don't fix what isn't broken, Keep melting pot good|5|The melting pot is delicious time and time again however it is expensive so I take my wife there for special occasions, most recently for our wedding anniversary. The food is delicious and there is a lot of it especially with the four course experience, however they changed their menu a bit. Their servings are now individual based instead of for two so you have to pay for two serving even though one is enough for two people. Their dessert platter has changed as there is now four pieces of pineapple on the platter instead of a piece of cheesecake (which my wife loves) so we had to pay additional to get a tiny sliver of seasonal cheesecake (blueberry) with a couple other things for $5.99 (not worth it). Still an overall great time and meal but as it is a splurge once or twice a year my wife was a little let down by the changes.
June 21, 2015|We have gone to a number of Melting Pots...|5|We have gone to a number of Melting Pots over the past 5 years and this visit was among the top experiences. Other than it being a bit on the pricey side for my budget, there is nothing negative to report. Our server was wonderful and the food was wonderful.
June 7, 2015|Horrible & Over Priced|1|The dishes cost $30-$50 each and they serve everything raw. The dining area reeks of raw fish and meat which you have to cook in a pot of boiling water at the table. It's not the most appetizing way to eat tiny bits steak (Everything is served in small bites so it can be cooked quickly at the table). We're never going back and we would not recommend this place to anyone. For a family of 4 it cost $250.
May 29, 2015|Intimate Dining|4|From entering the establishment to getting the bill it was a pleasant experience. My wife enjoyed the food and the wait staff. Very accommodating. The bill was rather high, but to be expected considering the fine dining experience we enjoyed. Worth every red cent.
May 18, 2015|Excellent|5|The melting pot is one of our favorite restaurants. The experience of dipping and cooking your food is a must try. Def not for the person who wants a quick meal. Be prepared to spend 1.5-2 hours enjoying the many courses. So much fun!
May 9, 2015|Restaurant was not understanding|2|Made reservations at approx. 3:00 PM on 5/9/15 on opentable.com. I couldn't inform the restaurant about a complementary gift I received via email (6 chocolate covered strawberries). An hour later I proceeded to call the restaurant to let them know about the gift. The restaurant decided not to honor the gift because I didn't inform them of the gift when I made the reservation. I explained to them that I didn't call the restaurant to make the reservation and they did not want to hear any explanation and just simply did not honor the gift. The only reason why I kept the reservation was because it was my daughters birthday. If not I would have canceled. the reservation the moment they said NO.
May 4, 2015|Our waitress was super nice and helpful....|5|Our waitress was super nice and helpful. The restaurant was quiet and there were not many patrons when we were there on a Monday night, but that meant we were the center of attention and could focus on spending time together. Cheese fondue was crazy good!
April 18, 2015|A restaurant where you cook your own food|4|The service here was great and the booths were very comfortable. I got the Fondue By You were you can mix three different entrees. The chicken pot stickers were great(would recommend getting), the old bay shrimp was good but very spicy and the filet mignon looked like really good cuts but I couldn't get the timing right on it. I would either take it out to early and have to put it back in or would just cook it to long so no matter what in came out chewy for me. My girlfriend got the chicken and she really enjoyed it. Make sure you have a timer on your phone so that you can measure the cook times. All in all a fun/entertaining time
March 30, 2015|Pricey|4|They don't seem to give you as much food like they use to. A little disappointed.
March 16, 2015|If you want a amazing night out start it...|5|If you want a amazing night out start it off right and see Ryan.
March 10, 2015|Another Great Melting Pot Visit|4|We revisited the Melting Pot in Providence to celebrate my 40th birthday. We got a secluded table and the wait staff were excellent. The pacing of the meal was perfect, which is important for fondue. We scaled back a little on portions when we ordered and this seemed to work great. We still left stuffed! This is not a cheap place to eat casually, but for a special occasion, it cannot be beat! I will be returning again (and again).
February 28, 2015|Delicious food and excellent service!|5|Delicious food and excellent service!

January 31, 2015|great anniversary dinner|5|Server fantastic, food amazing, soooo worth it. A little pricey but you get what you pay for and we had filet and lobster. went to the mall last minute decision and was told no open tables till after 830. Left and continued to shop and went on open tables.Com and was able to get a 615 Reservation. I assume They Block Of A certain number Of tables, BUT im Sure the Owner isnt loving THE profit Of People They Are Turning away. We watched two other couples get turned away and when we had dinner at least 3 tables never evendors had anyone sit at them. And that's only the tables I could see
January 23, 2015|Not my best nor my worse melting pot exp...|3|Not my best nor my worse melting pot experience. Our seating are was off the bar in a room which was drafty. There were two TVs showing sports which little privacy. Wish they validated parking
January 17, 2015|Fun time but super expensive|4|The whole experience was fun and the novelty of fondue is a great idea. But, it comes with a hefty price tag. The food was good/very good and the kids loved the idea of cooking it themselves. We went with a family of 6 and kids split meals. So, 4 adults and 2 children, we had a bottle of wine ($30) and the meal total was roughly ~ $327 - that included tip. So, it was good and it was fun, but for $55/pp - we could have ate at many other places and received more for our investment. Remember, the kids shared off of the adult plates so it really came out to ~ $80/pp, which is a bit pricey for what you get and you do all of the cooking :). I liked the place and our server was great, but I do not think I will be back with those kind of prices....
January 15, 2015|Fun, interactive experience|5|We haven't been to the Melting Pot in about 2 years, but came for my wife's birthday. We had a great meal, and delicious drinks. Our server, Brandon, was very attentive and made sure we enjoyed every course. We will definitely be back!
December 31, 2014|perfect for a quiet New Year's Eve|5|4 course prix fix dinner. Our waitress was very attentive. We had a bottle of wine. Outstanding.
