February 27, 2016|Beautiful and romantic|5|My surprise to my husband, they handed him a rose as we sat down as requestoed, the wine was amazingly selected by our waiter. the food was outstanding if yu get a salad get the spinach oh my goodness. waiter very attentive and helped with our first UBER ride - Amazing gem of a restaurant.
February 12, 2016|calming atmosphere|3|Great ambiance but the signature drinks were awful. Food was excellent. Scallops were a little salty but cooked great.
February 11, 2016|accommmodating|4|We had to add to our party of 9 and make it 11 and they were very accommodating. Service was good but I thought a little slow but it was OK we were in no big rush. The food was great - no one had an issue. The ones who ordered Paninis said they were awesome.
December 29, 2015|Comfortably Elegant|5|Centro's location on the second floor of the Omni Hotel was a delightful find. The hotel is easy to find, plenty of nearby parking, and the gracious lobby provided a bustling energy upon arrival. The maître d' was attentive, greeted and guided us to our table and party. The restaurant was quiet allowing time to soak in the decor and atmosphere of comfortable elegance. Our server was very attentive in an unobtrusive way and patient with 3 friends with 35 years of history between them to talk about. I ordered the shrimp cocktail and was pleased with the four fresh jumbo shrimp served on ice with a lemon wedge and cocktail sauce on the side. They were chilled appropriately and had a decent snap to them. The sauce could have been stronger / needed more horseradish, but I do like a cocktail sauce that makes your eyes water and your sinuses sing. For my entrée I enjoyed greatly the rigatoni bolognese. A just right portion of al dente pasta lazed in a flavor-rich sauce laced with tender beef, pork and veal and freshly grated parmesan cheese. The taste and texture combinations were overwhelmingly satisfying and I found myself repeatedly expressing my pleasure over this dish. I complimented the meal with a glass of Iron Horse Estate chardonnay. We finished with flourless chocolate cake and lemon ricotta cheesecake, both of which were delightful. Would definitely return. Was a true pleasure of a meal.
December 25, 2015|Lovely Christmas meal!|4|we went on Christmas day for a quiet respite ...my absolute favorite is the pizza with truffle oil, cheese, and pancetta. I will go back just for that. Steak was cooked to perfection. Server was not at all educated on wines and service but she tried hard.
December 24, 2015|Waited 2 hours for food and when it came...|1|Waited 2 hours for food and when it came out, it was cold! I will MEVER be back and will NEVER recommend!!!!!!!
December 16, 2015|Best|5|The best food I've tasted in a long time. Awesome service. I will definately be back.
November 26, 2015|Thanksgiving dinner|3|"The food was good, the service was good but even though the restaurant was serving barley six tables I felt they were rushing us. My daughter was still eating and they were trying to clear her plate. Most restaurants do this, they are so eager to clear all the plates it makes those who are not finished feel like they need to hurry up and eat. I go out to relax not feel like I need to gobble down my food. We came here for the Thanksgiving dinner and they were so adherent to the menu they would not let my son switch the sides from potatoes to the green vegetable offering. How is it such a big deal to plate one over the other? The answer is it is not! For a hotel restaurant this is ""good"" but I don't want to go out for a good meal I want a great memorable meal. I would not return."
November 26, 2015|The Thanksgiving dinner was very skimpy ...|3|The Thanksgiving dinner was very skimpy for $40.00 quality was good but there was hardly any turkey in the plate
October 30, 2015|Rediculous|3|Our reservation was at 7 pm and we did not get our food until 830!!! The restaurant did not have many people in it, yet the waitor said that the kitchen was backed up. We did not receive our appetizer until 8pm an hour after we ordered. Food was good but not worth the hour and ahalf wait at all. It was a little bit of a let down seeing as though we loved the hotel and the convenience of the restaurant within it but after waiting almost 2 hours for four entrees I dont think i would go again.
August 29, 2015|Blah|3|Was uninspired and rather dull. Nothing particularly awful but nothing was particularly good either.
August 22, 2015|Excellent food and service|5|From the bread to the delicious eggplant appetizer to the bolognese and chicken parm to the excellent wine and great service everything was perfect
August 1, 2015|PARKING/FOOD/SERVER|4|Our server, Yasmine, was excellent. Very informative and helpful. The food was delicious! Chicken Parm, pizza and salmon dish. The only downside was the issue of parking - I was told we could park in the R I Convention Center Parking garage. So we did. No attendant was there - we got our ticket. When we left, the hostess signed the stub for free parking up to 3 hours (We were only there about 1 1/2 hours AND it was after 5 as required.) The parking attendant said the ticket was not the appropriate ticket. So we paid the $12.00. After having a delicious meal and good service, the ending was a huge disappointment. I immediately called the restaurant. She said (whoever answered the phone) that they did not reimburse for RI CC parking - so why did she sign the ticket for reimbursement? And by the way, their website AND the R I Local magazine both say they reimburse for up to 3 hours. So I am totally confused and not very happy about this. I have sent the restaurant an email regarding this issue also. As of yet, no response. I would recommend the restaurant but I would be cautious about the parking reimbursement.
July 6, 2015|Great service great food|5|From the begging to the end our server was onpoibt, the food and dessert choices are excellent, i would def. recommen to come here to impress some one awesome atmosphere and impecable service
June 20, 2015|Centro was great|4|My brother recommended Centro as a great place to stop by after seeing a show at the Dunkin Donuts Center in Providence. We tried it and it was terrific. Located within the Omni Hotel. The restaurant was beautifully decorated and the food and service was great. We will go again.
May 17, 2015|graduation|3|we ate hear 3 times during our stay. Twice for breakfast, and once for lunch. The service for the first breakfast was inadequate. Also waitstaff was standing around during our meal, in the dining area, drinking coffee and having conversations.
April 25, 2015|It was OK but nothing really special. No...|2|It was OK but nothing really special. Not worth the money.
April 7, 2015|Very Dissappointing|2|Very disappointed in Centro. We just moved into a building connected to hotel in which Centro is located and we're hoping it would be a go-to place for us. When we arrived, we asked for a quiet table and were led to a table near a large, noisy group. When we asked to change we were told that restaurant was very busy that night. In fact, there were many empty tables which remained empty. After saying she would check and leaving us standing for several minutes we were finally allowed to move to another table. Our waitperson was very nice. We ordered appetizers and then waited 45 minutes for them (after about 15 minutes the server said they would be right out). Then we waited a long time for main course. All in all it was a 2 1/2 hr meal. We might not have minded the wait but the food was not good. Sauce on my veal Picatta was pasty and served lukewarm. Crime brûlée with bananas and fruite compote had no discernible bananas and fruit compote was a strawberry in a dollop of whipped cream. Menu was disappointing-mostly standard Italian fare with little creativity. Providence has many better choices at the same price level.
February 14, 2015|nothing special|3|Ambiance was good, wait staff was excellent and that is about it. Hostess was MIA. The food was not good. The clams appetizer was flat, no taste at all. The cod and scallop entrees were mediocre. If you're a guest at the Omni and are too exhausted to go to one of the many great restaurants in Providence then settle in and eat at Centro. Beyond that, don't waste your money.
February 11, 2015|What happened?|2|I am giving this a two star rating only because I ate here over a year ago and had a very good experience. This time, however, they should get no more than 1 star. The waiter was extremely slow and I had to flag him down every time we wanted something. After half our table ordered veal, he came back 10 minutes later and said they were out. No big deal, that happens. As a result everyone at our table got chicken and EVERYONE of us thought the texture was way off. I honestly think they may have microwaved it! It was awful. We didn't have time to send it back because we were trying to get to a game. Furthermore, the waiter never even came by to ask how our meal was Unfortunately, I am not sure I will ever go back after such a bad experience. Too bad, because my first time there a couple of years ago it was very good.
January 28, 2015|Service and speed embarrassing, food average|2|I really wanted to like this place. It's location to the hotel and concert we were seeing was very appealing. The atmosphere is also great. However the service was terrible. We gave ourselves 2.5 hours for dinner before our show. And that was barely enough time to finish dinner. We waited about an hour for our entrees, and our waitress was rarely ever to be found. We had to threaten to leave before our food was finally brought out. The food wasn't bad. Nothing special. The staff could have at least got us a round of drinks or asked if we needed drinks during the long wait.
January 18, 2015|We stayed at the Omni and I got a fantas...|5|We stayed at the Omni and I got a fantastic birthday celebration dinner - took our time with some cocktails and shared appetizers and two delicious entrees and dessert. Service was on point and ambiance was romantic. Great spot!
January 17, 2015|Awful service, total dealbreaker|2|I came with a group of girls for a fun night out and we were all really excited to try a new place. The menu looked promising, the atmosphere was beautiful but it was a sore disappointment for all. The service was some of the worst I have ever personally experienced. We left feeling like we were a burden rather than having an enjoyable experience. It took almost 15 mins to get a glass of wine, the water and bread we requested never came and the bill took probably the most time to take care of with her. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about either...and for the price, it wouldn't be a place I would come back to. It unfortunately just simply did not meet our expectations and next girls night we will be going elsewhere.
October 25, 2014|Won't go back|3|Nobody at door to greet us. Waited for table even though we had reservation. Waiter was distant and unfriendly. Too dark to read menu. No suggestions made. Didn't get our drinks until after appetizers. Nit a mention of friends birthday. A total fail.
October 18, 2014|Small portions|4|The menu had some great options. The portions were a little on the small side for the prices. The food was delicious, however. The ambiance/ atmosphere was very nice and a very nice bar/ lounge area.
October 11, 2014|Service was awful!|1|We were a party of 4. The waiter we had was terrible. He was not very pleasant, seemed always in a rush & did not really care about our service. We ordered 2 apps & 4 entrees. I had asked for a substitution no potatoes just veg & the waiter told me he would ask the chef came back out and said the kitchen is to busy to do that but we could order a side of veg. Then ALL our food & apps came out together! It got cold because we could not eat everything at once. The server came over & did not even care or offer us any options just said oh well it's busy back there! In the end the server never apologized or did anything for the inconvenience. Sad part is the food was delicious...
September 28, 2014|Expensive Restaurant|3|Although the food was good it was very expensive. More than other downtown Providence restaurants. And if you want coffee?? Each and every cup is $4.00 !!
September 13, 2014|Lovely, quiet, convenient|4|Came here after Disney on Ice at the Dunkin Donuts Center. It started raining as the show let out, so we used the indoor sky walk that connects the DDC to the Omni Hotel where Centro is and the Providence Place mall as well.The atmosphere was perfect after the high energy and noise level of where we'd just left; quiet, large and softly lit.We had beef carpaccio and meatballs to share as appetizers; both delicious. Our party had mac & cheese (my 4 yo; they do have a kids menu though I didn't see it on the website - was planning on getting her a pizza); snapper, salmon and pork entrees. All vey well prepared, as was creme brûlée and coffee. Great service except for a 15min disappearance after dessert was brought, we waited for our check.
August 9, 2014|Pre Waterfire dinner|4|We attended the full Waterfire lighting in Providence on 8/9/14. Knowing how crowded these events are, we decided to make early (5:30 PM) dinner reservations so we would have ample time for a leisurely meal prior to the lighting. We arrived early and were seated immediately. Since this was well before 'prime time' (7 PM on) it was not crowded at all. Service was excellent, attentive and friendly. Lobster Ravioli was excellent. Salmon with fingerling potatoes, fresh peas and artichoke hearts was delicious. Prices appear appropriate; 2 cocktails, shared salad, 2 entrees, 2 desserts (cheesecake, creme brulee), 2 coffees came to $117. Afterward, a short walk to the Basin area for the lighting. Enjoyed the meal and the evening.
July 29, 2014|Waiter that is on your side|4|I want to start with a suggestion. Upon arrival, ask for Paul M as your waiter. He is professional, attentive to his customers, and goes out of the way to take care of his customers. Now about the restaurant. The restaurant is fairly new and well decorated. It is quiet and good for dinner conversations. The clam chowder is excellent with large chuncks of clams. For entre, I highly recommend the scallop and the sirloin. The red snapper is a bit on the plain and tough side so I would stay away from it. The lobster ravioli is delicious. The portion seemed a bit small.
July 26, 2014|A Providence Gem|5|In a city of many great restaurants, it is difficult to stand out, but Centro manages to do that.
July 19, 2014|Food|5|Dinner food gas great flavor and presentation. The breakfast buffet and staff the next day were great as well. Ambiance was five star.
May 10, 2014|Nice evening|4|"Was surprised to find that this restaurant was in a hotel, but it was a very nice dinner without the ""canned"" atmosphere one finds in many hotel restaurants."
April 26, 2014|Last Minute Surprise|5|We had a change of plans last minute and needed a new location for a party of 10 on a Saturday night.. Found this place on open table and made the reservation... Everyone was pleasantly surprised how nice the atmosphere was.. We waited at the bar (by choice) while everyone arrived and had a. Great bar tender.. They sat us at a great table... Food was just as tastefully as the place itself... Would highly recommend this place to any and all my friends...
April 12, 2014|Consistently Very Good|4|Food is always great. Having no specials was a little disappointing but everything was great...
March 29, 2014|Delicious food @ Centro|5|The food was really great at Centro. I felt the prices were a little high but since I'm not from the area they may be spot-on. The service was wonderful and our server was great. We asked to have separate checks which I realize is extremely annoying to servers but ours was fabulous.
March 7, 2014|Formally known as the AGORA|5|Often overlooked as a hotel restaurant the formally known AGORA was renamed the CENTRO. It is located in the new OMNI hotel which is the old Westin Hotel which is connected to Providence Place Mall via a sky bridge. We were looking for a light lunch and a walk in the mall on a cold winter day. At the entrance of the CENTRO we actually met the chef and asked him what he would recommend: The spinach salad and the Vegetable Panini was our choice among his recommendations. Turns out the chef is always right. The Panini was delicious, not too fatty but crisp on the outside. The spinach salad had walnuts and goat chees. A perfect light lunch!
February 15, 2014|Perfect for Valentine's Day|4|I took my girlfriend here on Valentine's Day, not knowing much about the restaruant. It exceeded my expectations...the wait staff was exceptional, the food was delicious, and the overall atmosphere was great! I had the Sirloin steak and my girlfriend had the scallops...both were fantastic!
February 15, 2014|The food was very good. Lots|3|The food was very good. Lots of flavor. The featured drinks were a let down, Serving size wasnt what you would have expected. And our water boy had more menu knowledge than our server.
Dined on January 17, 2014|So So|3|Centro is very nice inside, the host was pleasant and our waitress was also friendly and honest when it came to her opinion on food choices...this is the only reason I give the overall place a 3. I think what matters most about a restaurant is food and there food was nothing to rave about, I ordered the squash soup...it was simple yet good but not awesome. As an entree I got the salmon and I've had better and even made better myself so I was a bit disappointed. Even the potato things on the side weren't very good, had a weird taste which I did not enjoy very much. As a dessert I got the Tiramisu which I've had better at multiple place, my boyfriend ordered their cherry banana bread pudding, and we did not like that at all.
November 9, 2013|All of our meals were well|4|All of our meals were well prepared and very tasty. We would come back again.
November 3, 2013|Good Food - Average Service|4|"Food was very good and the portions provided were on the large side. The service was spotty at best. Our waiter could have been more attentive, did not bring spoons or milk when he served our tea at dessert and did not check with us frequently enough throughout our dinner. We also felt that the service was very slow. The highlight of the meal was sitting next to Adam West's table, ""the original batman"", who was dining in the restaurant after the ""Comic-Con"" convention."
September 28, 2013|You will find better places|3|Didn't think the serviço was very good No patience and knowledge about the wine list & food Also we found many other places much better to eat, such as CAV
September 28, 2013|generally underwhelmed|3|Went there for a anniversary dinner. The service was very slow, but as well, the waitress acted like we were asking her to rob a bank when I asked for something not quite on the menu (which it was on the menu, she just could not think creatively- or be bothered to be more blunt). The service standard I think it generally not at the high bar that a restaurant with that menu and price point should be. The food was actually good (thank goodness, or I would have walked out). I am not sure if some people lower their bar on what they accept...But with so many other options and wait staff that are trained and willing to be of service, I am afraid that I would never go back there.
May 18, 2013|Great|4|I came here for graduation dinner with a group of 9 in total. The staff was excellent, knowledgable, and the food was fabulous. Everyone at the table was pleased. We got three appetizers to share and everyone ordered different entrees, everything was absolutely delicious. We had a few bottles of wine along with dinner and the list was impressive and our selections were delicious. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.
May 12, 2013|Enjoy and Dine|5|My experience at Centro Restaurant and Lounge was great. Very attentive and Friendly service and a very cozy, immaculate atmosphere. I would encourage any one to try it.
April 13, 2013|We brought a large group to|5|We brought a large group to Centro for a special event and had a wonderful time. Our server Frank was extremely nice and attentive and the food was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal!
March 31, 2013|above average yet disappoints|3|have dined here five times. its a decent place with solid italian food, yet nothing to write home about. the dining experience is, overall, a bit parochial. that is, the servers, bartenders, and food are reflective of a typical rhode island take on italian food. nothing too creative or experimental here and nothing impressive. the food is better than the service, however, which is done by very kind yet untrained servers. again, much of this is to be expected in a small state with not a lot of fine diners. the problem here is that the prices are too high for quality of the overall experience so you feel gouged. i hope the owners will find a way to put together a menu that has good quality but is slightly less expensive.
September 10, 2012|yom|5|the food was very good went early so it was not busy had a port dish that was to die for with vivergar petter would go there again for special dinner a little on the high side but worth it
August 31, 2012|MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CASH|4|Everything was perfect...... EXCEPT...... They only take cash... We had to go to 2 different atms to get money for our dimmer.. I usually dont carry 200.00 or more Dollars on me. So this was a total let down... Make sure you check before you start to order... Food was Great Service was Great but a big let down when we went to pay...We were in a hurray for another appointment since we had to run around to find an atm we were late ..

May 27, 2012|Excellent food, wonderful staff|5|We dined at Centro Restaurant to celebrate my daughter's graduation. The staff was helpful and friendly and the food was excellent. Dishes such as the crabmeat appetizer, the slowly cooked Atlantic salmon and the carrot cake were memorable. I would definitely return to this restaurant when I visit Providence.
May 26, 2012|The overall feel and ambience|5|The overall feel and ambience of the restaurant is great. Nice menu and great food. We would definitely go back again.
May 26, 2012|Imaginative Italian|5|My daughter and I had a fabulous dinner, from first course through dessert. Dishes are imaginative but not outlandish. The beet, goat cheese, and faro salad was unusual but very tasty, as was my daughter's chianti pear, argula, and proscuitto salad. (The only quibble here: the proscuitto slices were the bottom layer and thus completely out of view; she'd eaten most of the salad before she found them.) My daughter had the deconstructed lasagna with buttercup squash and I ordered the pasta ribbons with braised beef cheeks in a creamy truffle oil infused sauce - both wonderful. Desserts are generous - the untraditional but delicious biscotti plate could easily satisfy two. Service was very attentive. Expensive, but worth it!
May 25, 2012|Good dinner in downtown Providence|3|The food was very good, but not exceptional, and the portions seemed to be too large. I know that is a strange criticism in supersized America, but too much of a good thing is not necessarily good, and nobody had room for desert. It seemed to be a tad overpriced for the quality hence the three stars instead of four.
May 19, 2012|Staff was very nice and friendly,|4|Staff was very nice and friendly, made a reservation ahead of time to avert any long waiting periods after graduation. Dissappointed as table was not set up and ready when we arrived......
May 13, 2012|Mother's Day Brunch|5|For Mothers' Day my son paid in advance for brunch for both grandmother and me. EVERYTHING was FABulous! Service was EXCELLENT (John), and the food was absolutely TOP NOTCH!!! We lingered for 2 hours and savored every morsel. Thank you for a wonderful experience!!!
May 3, 2012|My husband and I went to Centro|4|My husband and I went to Centro for first time this week. It has own unique style , wonderfully dark and cozy. We loved it. The staff was very attentive.Don husband had build a burger and turned out to be enormous and I had the ahi dinner that was wonderful. Centro has the best selection of martinis: We tried 3 unique and fabulous Martinis.We would go back again and recommend Centro to friends.
April 21, 2012|If the food was as excellent|3|If the food was as excellent as the service, I would have given Centro five stars across the board.
April 8, 2012|don't bother|3|We went for easter brunch. We thought the food they had was good but it was the skimpiest buffet we have ever been to. So few choices and not great selection. The dessert table was a joke. tiny pieces of cake or small cookies. not impressive at all. We usually go in boston but thought we would try providence. The mimosa was not included and the choices were so limited. not worth the money at all. No shrimp, no salads, it was not what we expected.
April 7, 2012|We just had grilled pizza|4|We just had grilled pizza & salad, but everything was very good. Great service, very relaxing.
March 30, 2012|Our first trip to this renewed|4|Our first trip to this renewed hotel restaurant and we were very pleasently surprised. I had a shrimp and fetticini dish and my wife had a meatless and red sauceless lasagna tht melted in your mouth. Frank, our waiter, was solicitous and helpful without being intrusive. Place was packed and we feared we wouldn't get in and out by our theatre time but no problem. Can't believe they fed o many so fast so well. Wine list ran from 3090 so plenty of options. Longer serving hours and availibility of sandwiches will make it a great place for after DD Cntr Events while waiting out traffic. We were very happy & will return
March 28, 2012|I'm always a little concerned|4|I'm always a little concerned when I dine at a hotel, but there is no need with Centro. The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. I sat at the bar and Sandra made me feel like I was the most important person there. She also makes the best drinks! I would definitely go again and recommend this place to anyone visiting Providence - hey, even if you live there, try Centro.
February 28, 2012|Best carrot cake I ever had.|4|Best carrot cake I ever had. Would go back just for that. Our server Crystal was excellent. Very attentive support staff as well. Convenient location, expecially in winter, if attending an event at the Dunkin Donuts Center or the R.I. Convention center as the restaurant (located in the Westin Hotel) and the venues are all connected by indoor walkways. Leave your coat in the car in the attached parking garage.
February 14, 2012|First time and I was very|5|First time and I was very impressed. We went on valentines Day and that had a prefix which we never do but we decided to give it a try and it was excellant. I will return to try the regular menu
February 14, 2012|Nice night, good food.|4|Made Valentine's reservations and decided not to go with the special menu. The decor is very nice, you wouldn't know it's a hotel restaurant ... very well done. The brie and filo starter was excellent. I had the pork chop and it was cooked a ok. The chicken dish was tasty too. The potato side dish was nuclear hot and not nuked either, just hot! Would return. Mike was an excellent server. Nice beer list too, pear martini was way too sweet.
February 14, 2012|PERFECT Valentine's Day date!|5|I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day dinner after reading the reviews on this website. Valet service is available for $9, it was nice. We pulled right up to the front door and they took the car. Easy. We took the esclator up to the second floor and were greeted promptly and graciously. After confirming our reservation they took our coats and walked us to the table. The waiter we had was AWESOME! I can't remember his name but he was the best waiter we've had in the past year. The food was delicious and of very high quality. The suggested wine was also delicious. I was thoroughly impressed. The service, food and ambiance was wonderful and the price is more than fair. Thank you Centro, my girfriend was impressed!
February 14, 2012|2 thumbs up (three if I had them)|5|Centro was a great restaurant with great service. I would (and already have) recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a place that is not commonly known with a very classy atmosphere.
January 25, 2012|Menu selections interesting|4|Menu selections interesting and creative. A few issues--fire alarm kept going off at beginning of meal which was annoying and made it difficult for wait person to explain specials. Service was a bit slow. Two of our party ordered the same cocktail--one was excellent, the other way too sweet. Most of us liked our food, but the one person who ordered a chicken dish said it was overcooked and inedible.
January 20, 2012|Great place for high quality|4|Great place for high quality food. Food and service make you forget you are tucked inside the hotel. Great food, varied menu worth multiple visits!
January 8, 2012|The food was great. They messed-up|4|The food was great. They messed-up our order in the beginning, but made-up with an apology, extra course and free dessert. Very good place.
January 7, 2012|First time there very impressed|5|First time there very impressed had oysters that were very fresh great flavor then I had the duck liver on toasted biggette with the pork belly follow. by double thick porkchop wild rice with cranberries and maple syrup the pork was slightly over cooked I like med rare but none the less very flavorful!
December 25, 2011|Very good service and nice|3|Very good service and nice atmosphere. Food was good. The chicken was a little dry but my wife had pasta with braised shirt ribs that was very good. Service was excellent. I would recommend.
December 3, 2011|Went here because of an Eversave|2|Went here because of an Eversave I purchased and was very disappointed. The menu wasn't very exciting and nothing stood out as something I really wanted to try. Apps were all expensive at $15 or $16 however, the pastas and entrees seemed more reasonable. Ordered the scallops appetizer, pasta bolognese and the canelloni. We didn't care for any of it and didn't feel it was worth the money they charge for it. Will not be back.
October 15, 2011|Fun night - dressy casual, good bar|3|Menu selections somewhat limited. Very nice decor. Great looking bar. Traditional New England favorites such a cod and assorted mussels and little neck clam entrees. Appetizers good. Pizza oven fired with crisp light crust. Fun spot in a great location.
October 15, 2011|Overall, not worth the time.|2|Overall, not worth the time. Salads and starters were good. Pasta dishes were way overcooked to the point of being mush. Service was atrocious. Literally took 45 min from having our salad plates cleared to being served dinner. Then, another 30 min from receiving after dinner drinks to receiving dessert, weren't even served at the same time. Would not go back at any point.
October 8, 2011|wonderful restaurant--you|5|wonderful restaurant--you do not even feel like you are in a hotel
August 13, 2011|I went to Centro with a group|5|I went to Centro with a group of 13 people on Waterfire night. We choose it because it was very close to the Waterfire area and had a reservation for a group our size. We were blown away by the service and food. Not one person had a negative thing to say about their meal. When one person in our party wasn't satisfied with their cocktail, our server, Frank, took it back and made a different one free of charge. And at the end of the meal, he offered to take our group picture (which being a group of women, required more than one take!) We will definitely be back! Thanks Centro!!

July 21, 2011|What one expects in fine dining|5|"We felt the professionalism of team Centro the moment we arrived. Liz, the hostess, gave us a sincere welcome with a pleasant introduction and an offer to tour the restaurant. Our bartender readily secured our order and delivered martinis made to perfection! The wait team was gracious and accommodating. An unexpected guest joined our party of 6 late. They organized a place setting and seated her in under 10 seconds! They are friendly, flexible, gracious and helpful. The head waiter was ""appropriately chatty"" and excellent in offering wine pairings and menu selections. The chef, true to his friendly Texas nature, was wonderfully accommodating and let us know his job was to ensure we had a great food experience--he exceeded our expectations."
