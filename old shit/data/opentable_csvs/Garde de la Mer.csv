February 20, 2016|Food was OK|2|The food overall was OK, nothing special. The appetizers, in particular the octopus were minuscule and there was not much to share. The duck was too salty and not cooked as it should. The wine list was intensive and the wine we ordered (gigondas 2011) was expensive but worth every penny.
February 19, 2016|High expectations - saved by drinks and desert|3|Headed to an early dinner on a Friday night ahead of a show to celebrate a birthday. Ordered drinks, two salads, two main dishes and deserts. Service was great and food showed up fast (too fast - did not finish salads before main dishes showed up) - Espresso liqueur drink - AWSOME !!! - Bread - nice home baked with Gorgonzola cheese topping - Salad - $10 Artisan Greens- Breakfast radish, cucumber, carrot, shallot, confit lemon vinaigrette Hmm - gritty, like sand in the dressing - one portion was returned uneaten - Manager reassured us that is wast not sand - :) - Main Dishes - (1) $30 Sea Scallops - Succotash, polenta, butternut squash - Scallops seared outside completely raw inside (chef was rushing - 130 degrees, use a thermometer if u can gauge it ) Sent back to be cooked thoroughly - Other than that was a nice dish with complementary ingredients. (2) $27 - Arctic Char Roasted beet barley, celery root, apple, mustard greens - Nice dish ! Fish (maybe 5-6 oz sampler) was medium rare (but I like that), barely was nice . - Desert - Moist apple cake with yogurt - Heaven ! In short drinks and desert were the saving grace of this meal :)
February 18, 2016|Anniversary Dinner|4|My fiance and I decided to try this place since we had heard the food was really good. We dined on a Thursday day and were surprised there were only about 4 parties in a two-level restaurant. This was good for us since we wanted a quiet, romantic setting. We started with three different kinds of oysters that were some of the best we've ever eaten. Then ,we shared the sausage and lentil starter. The combination of flavors in this dish were amazing. I got the duck a l'orange which while I was eating it had great flavor but turned out to be too salty after it settled in. I had three full glasses of water when I got home. My fiance had the branzini which he thought was good but not great. We shared the creme brulee for dessert and were very disappointed. It was some of the worst creme brulee we've ever had. The sugar on top was too burned and tasted that way and the creme was the wrong consistency- too liquid almost like pudding instead of toward the flan family as it should be. We each had a cocktail which were both delicious and wine which was reasonably priced. The service and server were great. All in all a memorable dining experience with good views of the city but not sure how much longer this place will be there considering it was not very busy. We definitely would like to stop by for some oysters and cocktails again.
February 14, 2016|Valentine's Day|5|We have been here several times lastly was Valentines Day. What a great experience, the prefix meal was amazing and service was spot on. Thank you Benjamin!!!
February 14, 2016|A wonderful Valentine's Day experience|5|As out-of-towners we found this restaurant for Valentine's Day. We had a wonderful dinner and the waiter was fantastic. The bar is very attractive, and the food was beautifully presented. We would definitely come again, or recommend it to anyone .
February 13, 2016|Great food, service needs work|4|Valentine's day so prix fixe with limited choice. She had the fish and I had the chicken, both excellent. Bibb salad and calamari starters were a hit also. She had the chocolate torte and I something I else better than that that I can't remember. Service was indifferent. The band was good and not too loud. Its a good room and we would go back.
February 13, 2016|Anniversary dinner|3|Dinner was supposed to be special. My wife called ahead to let the staff know it was our anniversary (also valentines weekend) and she was told we would be able to order off the regular menu if we wished. We were also supposed to have a special table and get a celebratory dessert, none of which happened. My food was excellent but my wife's was below par. We will not be returning.
January 30, 2016|Have been to Garde de la Mer several tim...|4|Have been to Garde de la Mer several times and thoroughly enjoy the ambiance and food. This particular Saturday evening the service was very poor....perhaps a new waiter? Forgot my appetizer while my date had his chowder and delivered the bill before the dessert menu. Also had to ask if there were any additional specials on the menu. Definitely not the norm for this establishment. Service is usually wonderful. And we love the bar!
January 29, 2016|Usually love this restaurant.  This past...|4|Usually love this restaurant. This past visit was a bit of a letdown in terms of the food (service and ambiance were great). The rolls were stale, the special appetizer (Arctic char with blood orange) was TINY, and the special entree (short rib) was very dry. On the plus side, the calamari was terrific as always - I think it's the best calamari in Rhode Island - and the creme brulee was excellent.
January 16, 2016|Wonderful Addition to Providence|5|I had seen Garde de la Mer appear over a year ago, with little or no fanfare, announcements, or word of mouth. The location looked gorgeous, but the prices were a little higher, and without any particular special occasion in mind, I noted it for some indeterminate future visit. I'm sorry that I've waited so long to dine here. The food was amazing, the decor is beautiful, and the service was perfect. I came for restaurant week, and the marketing worked. I'll be sure to frequent this establishment often and will recommend it to anyone who will listen.
January 9, 2016|Very good on a quiet night!|4|This was our first visit on one of the quietest weekend restaurant nights of the year. Food was excellent! We started with octopus and Bibb salad. I had the char, others in my party had the lobster polenta, scallops, and the pollock. Everyone loved their meals...well prepared, tasty, and beautifully presented. Drinks were excellent full pours. I can comfortably recommend this restaurant...we plan to return on a more active night. Btw...our server was excellent and attentive.
January 8, 2016|Great meal!|5|My dinner was fantastic. I had a snapper special with best sauce. One of my companions had special dining needs. She was so happy with the dish that was prepared for her. She said she has never been presented with such a delicious meal that accommodated her allergies. we will be going back.
January 1, 2016|Perfect Dinner!|5|We have been to Garde on several occasions now and it has been consistently awesome...the menu is so good that the hardest part of the night is narrowing down what you want to order. Ben is about as good as it gets as a server and the entire crew is just top notch. If you are looking for good seafood and excellent service-there is no better spot in Providence than Garde! PS-the actual restaurant is gorgeous too!
December 12, 2015|Great theatre menu!|5|We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the cocktails were excellent. Service was great too! Will come back and will recommend to others.
November 21, 2015|We wowed our Boston friends.|5|We had a terrific meal, each of us ordered something different, and we all loved our choices. The dessert was particularly memorable. We had excellent service also. Our visitors were delighted, agreed that the cuisine, ambiance and service all measured up to the high standards offered in their home town Boston. We will probably choose a table a bit farther from the bar next time, just because we do prefer a quieter area.
November 21, 2015|Trendy|5|Love this place, food is fresh and cooked to order. This was our second trip there and look forward to our next trip. Our waitress Destiny was on top of it all evening even when we returned from out play she was interested on how are night was. Love, love, love this place. Keep up the good work.
November 21, 2015|A Gem in Providence|5|Garde de la Mer, Food and Staff were excellent 2nd time around

November 14, 2015|The food was delicious and the service w...|5|The food was delicious and the service was friendly. I was visiting Providence for a business conference and wanted some tasty seafood. (I'm from the Midwest so I rarely get fresh fish.) Garde de la Mer did not disappoint. I had the pan-fried haddock and it was amazing!
November 14, 2015|Slight off-night for a new favorite|3|"I've been to Garde de la Mer five times now, and always really enjoyed it. The chef's creations are consistently among the most interesting in the city, and are pieces of art when plated. The seafood is fresh and perfectly prepared. But Saturday was a rare ""off"" night. The wait staff seemed preoccupied, and took the wine list away two or three times despite requests it be left. Appetizer plates disappeared while we were still working on them. And the specials landed at the table without their usual flair and lacking the signature flavors we've come to expect. But it is the first time we've been disappointed here, so not a worry. Still, it was a surprise off night."
November 14, 2015|It's great seeing the chefs in action.  ...|5|It's great seeing the chefs in action. Not only is the food excellent but the presentation is like no other. Highly recommended to seafood lovers.
November 7, 2015|Birthday Celebration|4|We celebrated my husband's 61st birthday last weekend and we enjoyed our first experience at Garde de la Mer. The menu was small but appetizing. My husband ordered the lobster polenta but was disappointed in the size of the portion (small). It was rich tasting, though, and an interesting presentation; almost like a stew. I ordered the scallops and they were fresh and tasty. We found the portions small for the price, but Overall, we both enjoyed the ambiance and the service was very good.
November 7, 2015|Excellent Spot|4|My husband and I made reservations before an 8pm show at PPAC. We had an EXCELLENT dinner there. Beautifully cooked calamari which was perfectly seasoned and not at all chewy. My husband had steak which he loved so much he didn't even offer to share and I enjoyed the lobster polenta which also perfectly cooked and seasoned. Again the lobster was not all chewy. One of the best meals we've had in a very long time. We hope to be back again soon!
October 29, 2015|Great new find!|5|Decor contemporary but warm. Food great but wish foie gras was included on the menu as an appetizer! Service very good, staff friendly and professional!
October 17, 2015|Disappointing|2|"We had trouble parking the car. When we finally got in to the restaurant, the hostess said ""Yeah, the valet here is tricky."" ! We were seated next to the kitchen, even though we had reserved a booth. When we were moved, we discovered that our booth was only slightly less noisy than the table had been. The rolls were stale. The appetizers ranged from excellent (fried oysters and grilled octopus) to terrible (escargots). The entrées again ranged from a splendid cut of halibut that was nonetheless oversalty to a venison chop that lacked flavor and was served cold to splendid salmon fillet. The desserts were good (flourless chocolate torte, apple cake, and pear frangiapane), but the service was inattentive."

September 19, 2015|The venue is wonderful.  The decorating ...|4|The venue is wonderful. The decorating is terrific and the windows open up completely and there is outside dining as well. The service was very good and the food was very good. The location is great for a dinner before a show at PPAC.
September 18, 2015|Very good.|3|Accolades for a beautiful interior, exceptionally good Caesar salad with fresh anchovies and a chowder that goes beyond any preconceived notions. Lobster risotto was excellent, but the diver scallops were too salty for me. Service was casual but attentive, friendly and courteous.
September 17, 2015|Very good, but not extraordinary|4|I have had dinner at Garde de la Mer three times. The first time was, I thought, the best; the food was delicious and had very interesting modernist-type touches. This last time, although the food was very good (even though my entree was only lukewarm), I thought the menu items (except the clam chowder) were less adventuresome. Of course, many people do not like adventuresome, modernist cooking so I am probably a minority.
August 29, 2015|Great Find|5|Popped in on this place because of a special that we were part of. #rifoodfights #calamarichallenge we were very pleased with the whole experience. It made our top ten list!!
August 9, 2015|Very yummy!|4|Loved the wall-sized open windows. It was like eating outside but we were surrounded with the beautiful decor of the interior space. The oysters were super fresh and the dinner was very delicious (I had the tuna; husband had the swordfish) but the dessert (coconut lime mousse) was pretty under-whelming (although my husband's was outstanding! - the peanut butter napolean). Very inventive and unusual cocktails. Absolutely delicious.
August 7, 2015|You want it to be great, but -- en garde!|3|It's a beautiful place with a beautiful bar in a promising location, and all the visuals are terrific, including the presentation of the food. The seating was pleasant and comfortable. The muzak was a bit loud and intrusive, but we were able to tune it out after a while and could hold a three-way conversation easily in our booth. The hors d'oeuvres were good and nicely presented, though the bread rolls were too soft and sweet. My wife's arctic char was fine. My son and I both had the braised Moroccan (or whatever it was) lamb, which was excessively salty but did seem to have some tiny specks of lamb in it here and there. Maybe sheep are an endangered species in Morocco. The wait staff was a tiny bit over-extended apparently, though the place didn't seem all that busy and had plenty of seats on Friday night (early); the water boy was inattentive, which was unfortunate, given all the salt in the food. But we would give them another chance and have to wish them well.
July 28, 2015|Won't come back here|2|Food took almost an hour to come out. Waited a long time for our appetizers and then another 40 minutes for entrees. Food was overly salted and did not enjoy other entrees.
July 25, 2015|Lovely first evening dining at Garde de la Mer.|5|We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service. The friends who joined us, are very picky and often visit the best New York restaurants. They too were very happy with the restaurant food and service. We all agreed that the room decor was modern and in keeping with the building and an upscale (no pun in tended) fish restaurant. We were there for restaurant week so the price was wonderful. Otherwise, drinks are well priced but for a fish restaurant, normal rates are, in my opinion, a bit pricy. While we will definitely go again and recommend it, we would go very often if they could do their restaurant week menu on a daily bases.
July 25, 2015|Wonderful surprise!|5|Every aspect of our dining experience was terrific. The food was a delight with each course. We didn't realize this was restaurant week and we're pleased with the menu choices offered for this special. Such favors, I wanted to lick the plate!
July 25, 2015|Perfect!|5|We went with a party of six on a Saturday night for restaurant week and everything was perfect! The restaurant is beautiful, the food is absolutely delicious with a lovely presentation, and the service was spot on. Highly recommend!
July 24, 2015|To all the reviewers who said the food w...|4|To all the reviewers who said the food was too salty: please educate your palates. This is one of the few restaurants that seasons its food appropriately. Diners with pedestrian taste buds that think the food is too salty should frequent less sophisticated venues. Places like Garde de la Mer are wasted on non-foodies. I went to Garde de la Mer during Restaurant Week with three friends. First, all the dishes were beautifully plated. Second, the service was very attentive. Finally, everything tasted amazing. The squid appetizer was divine. The chef was brave enough to sautee the squid and include the tentacles. It seems like almost every other restaurant in Rhode Island limits itself to deep frying squid rings - so unimaginative! The dish also had a smear of the squid ink which made for great presentation. The trout entree was a tad overcooked and maybe slightly under-seasoned but the skin was nice and crispy. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake which was decadent and delicious, although I do agree with another reviewer who said it was more like a chocolate-encased mousse. My friends all had the panna cotta and even a die-hard chocolate lover like myself had a pang of regret that I didn't order it instead.
July 16, 2015|Fantastic restaurant. Went during restau...|4|Fantastic restaurant. Went during restaurant week. They had live music inside. The server was very attentive and the food was delicious. Would definitely come back.
July 15, 2015|They got it right.|4|I had not known about is restaurant until I was looking at the Restaurant W eek list and since trying new places is what RW is all about I decided to go there. All of our dishes were cooked and flavored well. We each had a squid appetizer and I then we had generous servings of sea scallops for one main and trout for the other. Desserts were both very good as well, a panna cotta and a what they bill as a flourless chocolate cake, but is more like a chocolate encased mousse that was refrigerator cold.. Plating is a bit odd,as they seem to plate entrees and mains in an off center diagonal with whatever else served with the protein under the protein. Loved the look of the place, lots of banquettes and nice bar. Wine list good with a few under $30.

July 11, 2015|Keeps Getting Better and Better|5|I was not in love with the menu when this place first opened…and then they thankfully changed a few items and we went and it was great. Then we went a few weeks later with friends and the menu was again different and even better….then we went with another couple on Saturday and the whole table wanted multiple dishes because the menu looked so good! Happy to report the actual food tasted as good as we hoped. Smoked tomato gazpacho was heaven on a hot day as was the picked shrimp app-so different and ultra delicious! Scallop dinner was perfect, there was a fun twist on the fish and chips, and the corn croquettes on my husband's dish was a fun treat too! Service has been constantly strong! I cannot wait to go back!
June 27, 2015|THE CHEF NEEDS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL|3|GORGEOUS NEW RESTAURANT. EXCITING VENUE, WONDERFUL ATMOSPHERE, GREAT MENU, TOP NOTCH DRINKS, A LOT OF GREAT THINGS TO BE SAID. ONLY ONE PROBLEM. OUR MAIN COURSES WERE POORLY PREPARED. MY FRIEND GOT THE SWORDFISH. IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY OVERCOOKED AND VERY RUBBERY. MY TROUT WAS SO SEVERELY OVERSALTED, THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ENJOY. BOTH ISSUES WERE A LACK OF ATTENTION TO WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE CULINARY REALM OF KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THE KITCHEN. AND THUS, ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THE PLACE PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE ENTREES THEMSELVES.
June 6, 2015|We went here for my husband's 65 th birt...|3|We went here for my husband's 65 th birthday. The service was excellent and we had a lovely evening. My husband ordered the bouillabaisse and was disappointed. There was hardly any fish or sauce. It was the most expensive item on the menu and it wasn't enough to fill you up. Although the rest of the meals were good, the menu wasn't exciting enough to want to come back. Step it up a little!
June 6, 2015|Good to be here|5|This is the third time we have been here. The first time we sat at the first floor bar. Very relaxing The second time we sat at a booth again on the first floor -more intimate. The third time we sat at a table on the second floor balcony. -smaller floor footprint and cozy. Both the second and third visits we went to the roof top bar. Wow what a happening place. We stayed later our most recent time and by the time we left there was a line for the elevator AND a line to get in the building via the revolving doors. The young generation has found the cool place to be. All good.
June 5, 2015|Food was exceptional great wine choices|5|"Went there for a special occasion. The servers were attentive and offered menu suggestions. The lamb with chickpea gnocchi appetizer was heaven. I had the striped bass...fantastic. The portions weren't huge so it left room for dessert. The vanilla lemon cheesecake with a carrot cake base or ""crust"" wass the perfect way to end the meal. I will definitely return."
May 30, 2015|Be On Guard|3|"Most reviewers on this site seem to like this place, I did not. The good stuff: our server and the wait staff were excellent. We had an issue with one of the entrees (not a send back, but a complaint of the concept and execution) and the meal was complimented from the bill; a very kind and correct gesture. The rolls were some of the best we have had: crispy crust, warm soft interior, brushed with salted butter; delicious. The desserts were outstanding a real showcase of the evening. You know if I am talking about he rolls, the rest of meal left me with a lot to be desired. The apps and entrees have loads of components but the there is little cohesion in the food. I also felt that certain meals are named after classics but should have a disclaimer; something named a ravioli shouldn't be meat on top a hard-to-find piece of pasta; bouillabaisse isn't green. I don't mind the changes but at least the change should either honor or be better than the original. I don't want to bash the place, everyone may have an off night. My guess here is we have a talented chef that may have a lot of terrific ideas and is still working through things: case in point, the aforementioned ""comped"" dinner: Olive Oil Poached Halibut. A sous vide of olive oil and halibut wrapped in nori. Halibut is generally a thick fish but the rest sounds good. It isn't. The fish is overdone, the olive oil and the nori become tasteless. This all rests on a sweet parsnip baby food concoction. To be honest not one thing (other than the bread and desserts) had a wow moment or exceptional flavor. In fact, to me, almost everything tried left me more puzzled than comforted or satisfied or made me interested in coming back. Oh well this happens. The room is very nice, a really beautiful setting. Wine list was ok - one note: a glass of a cotes de rhone from the maker Perrin can be had by the bottle at Trader Joe's for the same price. A vino no no. Go to Garde, but you have been forewarned: be on guard."
May 7, 2015|Great New Providence Restaurant|5|Loved this new Providence restaurant and would definitely return. Amazing service to go along with their upscale and delicious menu.

May 2, 2015|Exquisite|5|This relatively new restaurant is sure to become a gem in the crown that is Providence's dining scene. From the unique and tasty appetizers to the beautifully prepared and presented entrees, this restaurant continued to impress on every level. The service was fabulous and not rushed. We look forward to going back to try many of the other menu items in the near future.
April 17, 2015|interesting food|4|our first time in Providence, and this was a very nice find. convenient to hotels and the food was interesting, and well executed
April 11, 2015|Wow! What a fantastic new entry into the...|5|Wow! What a fantastic new entry into the Providence culinary scene. Garde de la Mer opened about three months ago and while our waiter confessed that they were still working-out the kinks, it sure didn't seem like it. The location at the corner of Dorrance and Weybosset is exquisite. Well-appointed in beautiful subway tile, woods and beadboard with an open kitchen. Plenty of tables of various sizes. Energetic vibe, especially in the bar. The service was spot-on: attentive but allowed us to relax without feeling rushed - also great recommendations on entrees and wine. Six varieties of oysters made it difficult to chose. The fresh seafood for mains was delicious, ample and prepared perfectly. Dessert was just enough to top-off the evening without being too much or too sweet. The espresso was the best I've had since in Italy a few years ago. The only drawback? Garde de la Mer will make it harder to choose the next time I come to Providence for dinner, but we'll be back!
April 10, 2015|The food was awesome.|5|Pork belly confit, squid, salmon and the tuna were delicious all done extremely well. We will be going back.
April 10, 2015|Outstanding new seafood restaurant!|4|We had read overwhelmingly positive reviews and were very excited to try Garde de la Mer. Our expectations were more than met. The wine list was impressive. The food was beautifully prepared and presented but even so, it was apparent that the kitchen prizes taste even more than style (not always so with modern restaurants). Our waiter was an obvious foodie and helped us to create an amazing meal. He was also surprisingly well versed about the wines and turned me on to a Chardonnay I actually loved. Kudos!
April 4, 2015|perfect for special occasions|5|This restaurant is absolutely perfect.. The seafood is fresh and the creations are inventive while maintaining and highlighting the freshness of the food . The service is impeccable but in the background they seem a bit informal ( chatting, laughing etc) but maybe they just really enjoy working there?
April 2, 2015|Great new addition to fine dining in Prov|5|really fabulous bartenders and edit staff, great oysters, squid and tuna. Gorgeous decor. My halibut was the only downside, wrapped in seaweed and a little mushy.
March 20, 2015|Fantastic food|5|This new restaurant is a real gem. Menu is creative and exquisite. Wine list is extensive. Our waitress was very attentive. The atmosphere is nice with low lighting and table cloths but the television over the bar diminished the romance of the place a little. Overall fabulous experience here.
March 12, 2015|a new favorite in providence|5|"Upon entering we were impressed with the beautiful interior architecture work. Service was prompt and welcoming throughout. Our waiter was a familiar face transplanted from Bacaro, another providence favorite. The food was excellent - from simple things like hot, freshly baked bread, to the tasty lemon semi freddo dessert and everything in between. I had the salmon and my wife had the scallops, both were as delicious as they were delightfully presented and prepared. When it was time for our entrees our server has plenty of help to deliver everything at exactly the same moment. I had the clam chowder appetizer and it was not only tasty but the presentation of pouring it at the table was a fun (and practical) twist. There were good non seafood options on the menu but we didn't opt for them. While dining we saw the owners of Persimmon, one of our favorite foodie finds in the East Bay, come in. Clearly the new Garde de la Mer has a buzz and is attracting foodies. I am told all the windows open up to provide an al fresco experience in the summertime. It is not yet ""discovered"", as there were many open tables in early March when we went just a few weeks after opening, so it seems they have not yet put much into marketing the place. If anything it felt a little empty but I am sure that will change as the word gets out. The bar has a towering tall ceiling and great artwork, with oysters on ice displayed at one end. It's a fun place to sit for a drink. The kitchen is open, visible and immaculate which is fun to watch. Only negatives here were that it would feel better if it were more discovered and full. Also they do not have any airlock by the door so on the chilly night there is a very cold draft as people come and go. I am sure they can figure that out, the core experience here is terrific and we will be back often. One of our new favorites in the city."
March 8, 2015|This was our first visit.  It was truly ...|4|This was our first visit. It was truly amazing. We were very pleased. It was early on a Sunday, so a bit quiet, but that made for a great opportunity to check out the view from the upper level. The food was excellent. Creative, fresh, and just enjoyable. A nice menu without too much to cause stress. We dined at the bar and the service was top notch. Very professional and well informed. Can't wait for the snow to melt and to go back!
March 6, 2015|Great dinner|4|We had dinner at Garde de la Mer with another couple--each couple split an appetizer that was excellent, and all 4 main courses were good to great. We would recommend it to friends.
February 21, 2015|Second time and we'll be back.|5|Great server. Free valet. Nice ambiance. Food yum! Loved the Maine Lobster and the Delmonico Steak. Clam chowder was very good served in a lovely manner. Great wine list too and the specialty cocktails were great.
February 21, 2015|BEST Seafood, Oysters, Atmosphere !|5|"We have been here twice, and the food has been outstanding both times. The wine list is robust, and they have some good cocktails. Their oyster bar is LEGIT with several different varieties and we have always asked them to bring the ""shuckers"" recommendation for their best selection. The seafood dishes have also been great! They also make some other great French/contemporary style cuisines. FREE Valet at the Providence G directly after the restaurant."
February 18, 2015|Fine dining for french Seafood|5|This is a very upscale restaurant at very fair prices. Creative preparations, wonderful service, delicious fresh seafood. Our second time dining there and both times excellent.
February 18, 2015|French upscale|4|New restaurant in a rehabed building will become crowded fast. May take several visits to decide if food is worth the price.
February 14, 2015|Unique Decor/ Great cuisine|5|Lovely atmosphere with romantic vibe. Delicious food, but very small portions. For the high price tag, meals should be more substantial. I am not a heavy eater and am a small person too, but I found I was hungry afterwards! Other than that it was really nice.
February 13, 2015|Good Prix Fixe Valentines dinner|5|Day before Valentine's, dinner before theatre. Wasn't expecting prix fixe, but it was very good, and reasonable (if you want 3 courses). Food was excellent -- from chowder to fish to dessert. Service was also very good, and prompt, once we told our server we had an 8 pm show. Ambiance is classy and welcoming. Good drinks, too!
February 13, 2015|Wonderful New Spot In The Providence Foodie Scene|4|I love this spot. Fresh oysters, lovely wine, and creative entrees. I've been twice. The second time however, my fish was overcooked, so maybe they need to work on consistency. The chocolate dessert is luscious.
February 12, 2015|Great addition to Providence Dining Scene|4|Garde de la Mer is a wonderful addition to Providence's fine dining scene. The food has Modernist elements and the options are interesting and beautifully presented although I'm not sure I detected any specific French influence. Rhode Island has long needed a fine dining seafood restaurant and this is it.
February 7, 2015|Thoroughly enjoyed this new dining experience....|5|Garde de la Mer is a new restaurant. My husband & I went there for his birthday and it was lovely. The ambience in the main room is very French urban with a lovely bar and cozy booths for four or more. As a party of two, we were slated to be seated in the room you enter as you come into the restaurant. We asked to be moved closer to the bar as this feels like the heart of the restaurant. The wine list was varied and had offerings across price ranges to appeal to all. The service was excellent. The staff was accommodating and helpful. The menu, as one would expect from the name, has a heavy emphasis on seafood. My husband had an octopus salad and salmon for an entree. He loves seafood and had a difficult time choosing because there were several unusual options with the specials. Each dish was creative, and would appeal to foodies. As in France, the offerings are done in numerous courses and they are portioned accordingly which was expected but the piece of salmon was particularly small. Everything was delicious, fresh and unusual. Looking forward to going back.
February 7, 2015|Top notch new restaurant|4|Found this place from Open Table, and I could not be happier. Started with oysters and squid app with black ink (outstanding). Followed this with an entre special (halibut sous-vide). The complexity of this dish was as surprising as it was delicious. Layers of flavors that you do not find often outside of big city foodie restaurants. My wife had the Delmonico steak, which arrived overcooked. We returned it without a problem, and it was a wonderful dish as well with a rich brown gravy, morel mushrooms, roasted sweet potatoes and parsnips with a base of mashed. Terrific stuff. Deserts were fantastic as well. Definetely will dine here again. They do need to beef up the menu a bit, but a great start. The server Destinie was informative, professional and attentive.

Dessert the chocolate torte and lemon semifreddo yum. We shared everything. Loved it. The hostess is awesome and our server was great too!

The food was very good-- not a Farmstead (RIP), but definitely well done. Would go here over Gracies, Salted Slate, and some of the other comparable restaurants. It's very pricey, so definitely won't be a regular. I wish they had a bar menu or some substantial apps at a moderate price (so I could be more of a regular). The decor is comfortable, so would be easy to hang out here after work for a drink or for a casual work meeting if it were a little more affordable. Overall-- would recommend.
January 22, 2015|Nice vibe but still new|3|I decided to visit Garde de la Mer for restaurant week because it looked beautiful and was new to the Providence food scene. However, it seems like its relative newness worked against me because they still seem to have a few kinks they need to work out with food and service. There were long waits between dishes, not very well spaced out, and the service overall lackluster. The dishes were also salty, and the lobster bisque came out cold. Overall, a beautiful restaurant that has potential if these flaws are worked out.

Absolutely great, from decor to presentation to taste. And I was told that there's going to be a restaurant on the rooftop during the warm season - I look forward to having that experience hopefully soon! Specifically I would like to suggest that you try their cocktails - wow! Really different from the standard fare.
January 21, 2015|Best restaurant week place I've been to!|5|Food was fantastic, presentation was beautiful, even the teabags were hilariously posh! The normal menu was a bit pricey for impoverished students such as myself (though really not that bad by Providence standards), but I definitely hope to be back here again for the next restaurant week!
January 17, 2015|Another Homerun at the G!|4|The physical space is beautiful! The wine list is awesome with gat prices...I liked the the restaurant week menu better than regular menu because I got the scallops with lentils which were heaven...but missing on regular menu (need to add either scallops or a white flake fish if you are going to be a seafiod restaurant)...waiter was great (even when fire alarm went off)...and dessert was also perfect! We will go back to eat when they add scallops to the menu, but will go back sooner just to grab drinks at bar!

January 15, 2015|You must go if you love fresh seafood|5|Excellent and fresh seafood with strong customer device. Desserts are also phenomenal. Try the sweet potato Genoese. Everything was spot on.
January 13, 2015|New Kids knock it out of the park|5|Let's start off with the fantastic decor. This place is just beautiful. The black and white interior, the killer marble bar, it's just classy as classy gets. And then there's the food and drinks. The Cote Garde was very nice and refreshing. The food was outstanding. My friends and I went here for Restaurant week, but I'll definitely be back sooner rather than later. The squid was tender and tasty and the aioli just tied everything together nicely, kinda like The Dude's rug. The arctic char was downright sublime. And the sauce, good lord! The torte was good, but the brown butter ice cream definitely blew everything else on the plate away. I cannot wait to go back for more. We also had a couple of oysters at the bar. Samantha, the raw bar chef/cook/shucker at the bar (not sure what title she has) was awesome. Friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and she steered us in the right direction with her recommendations. I hope this place lasts because it's a gem
