February 20, 2016|Disappointing and chaotic|2|We have been to Public Kitchen many times, mainly because it's the closest restaurant to the VETS auditorium. The food is OK, never amazing but generally not bad. The menu never seems to change much and has little focus, just a bunch of random items with no discernible theme. The service is uneven. Sometimes quick but often slow or just odd (some things come out quickly and others take forever). It seems that no matter how early we arrive, something delays us enough that we are racing out to make an 8:00 concert and have to skip dessert. I don't know what it is exactly, whether a shortage of staff, or not well trained staff (which certainly seems to be the case), but we have this experience nearly every time. I think we are about to give up on this place, in spite of the convenience. It's too bad, especially because it is in a nice hotel. I'm surprised they are not getting any pressure to improve.

Service was good at beginning but slowed to a crawl towards end even though dining area was almost empty. Bar was very busy and fun
January 16, 2016|Disappointing|2|We decided on Public for a pre-show dinner. It seems to be a popular choice with diners who have the same idea. I wish I'd asked to be moved as soon as another couple was seated immediately next to us along a banquette- their overpowering use of cologne was a tip-off to their level of overall obnoxiousness. While their behavior was not the restaurant's fault, this couple made sure that everyone in their vicinity knew just how unhappy they were and just how atrocious their table manners are (picking teeth with pick while seated at dinner, loudly sucking through teeth, smacking lips, napkin stuck into collar of shirt- it was almost a caricature.) If the meals we had been served were better, it might have lessened the impact our neighbors had on our meal. Unfortunately, the steak my husband ordered was overdone and my pasta, although topped with a pleasant sauce, was marred by large clumps of chewy, uncooked noodles that were stuck together. The meals were pricy considering the level of quality and finish. It should be noted that couples at tables on either side of us were dissatisfied with their entrees for coming to the table cooked incorrectly or not as promised. Extremely disappointing experience- we won't be back.
January 16, 2016|Disappointed|3|"We dined early (at 6 p.m.) with another couple. We ordered the steak special; they ordered fish. Their entree came 20 minutes before ours (there was supposedly a ""computer error.""). Our steak entree was mediocre, at best - and way overpriced - thus little value for a lot of money. At first our waiter was pleasant and attentive; then he ""disappeared"" as more people came in. It was hard to find him to pay our bill and we had a performance to attend. So food was just so-so and overpriced and service was mediocre and extremely slow. I would not recommend this restaurant; nor would I dine there again."
December 25, 2015|A very nice experience.|5|We were there for Christmas dinner and it was a wonderful dinner. The food was excellent and the service attentive, but not cloying.

November 7, 2015|Average|2|Overpriced given the small portions. Menu is on the smaller side. A little irritating that when I called they claimed to have no space at all until after 8:30pm but then they accepted an Open Table reservation for 6:15pm with no problem and the place was 2/3 empty when we arrived. Food quality was good. Just wish there was more of it on the plates.... Seems like a trendy place.
October 31, 2015|Very Good Experience|4|We were two couples in search of good food, reasonably priced and not too noisy. While the selection is limited, it was diverse enough for meat-eaters, non-meat eaters, those seeking comfort food and those looking for a little adventure in their food. I had a salmon tartare that was scrumptious as were the home made chips that came with. My husband had the Thai noodles which he said were very tasty, although not as spicy as he usually likes, and our friends had a homemade pasta with chicken and a Kimchi soup (very spicy!) We also had the roasted beet salad and fries. Everything was well-prepared, plated and thoroughly enjoyable. The service was terrific - our server was very attentive, but perhaps he was able to be because it was not at all busy on a Saturday night. We were there relatively early, but it wasn't exactly filling up even by the time we left. Halloween, maybe? We would definitely recommend it and will go back.
October 29, 2015|Dinner|2|I was very disappointed, we made reservations and were never told limited menu because there was a show at vets....nothing on website either!.And why limited menu it was not busy at all.. It was overpriced and small portions.,not even a salad included . A ten dollar bowl of chowder was a large bowl not even a quarter full ! barely a cup! Why would you serve a nearly empty bowl for that price and not even a cracker! no bread with dinner. My husband was still hungry shorts ribs were short. It was very overpriced with so many dining options in providence this is not up to par.I feel the limited menu was to take advantage of people going to show.The only good thing was the excellent service . In all it was quite the disappointment and alot of money....If we were told ahead nothing like website, or informed by hostess limited menu before seated and ordered drinks we could have gone elsewhere.
October 18, 2015|Meh.|3|We went here for Sunday brunch. Food was OK. Our party had meat lovers omelet, traditional eggs benedict, and the daily special omelet. The common side was rustic potatoes and omelets came with a choice of toast. The potatoes were delicious - crispy and seasoned well. The omelets were OK but not outstanding. Somewhat flavorless. The eggs benedict should have had slightly runny poached eggs but the eggs were basically hard boiled (i.e. over-poached) and the hollandaise was thick and bland (should have had a tang a lemon and pepper). The service was really passive and not attentive (we had to ask for our waitress to come back several times because she kept forgetting to bring items that should have been served without asking - she put 3 water glasses on the table when there were 6 of us. She brought 4 coffee cups for 6 people, etc. Forgot to bring the cream, etc. It was NOT busy at the time we were there - only 5 or 6 total tables occupied so can't write it off to having to take care of too many tables. Plenty of wait staff available. Overall, won't go there again and won't recommend.
October 17, 2015|very disappointed|2|If you are staying in the hotel this is a very convenient place to eat. The staff is friendly and helpful and the place is very attractive. The food is mediocre. My seafood stew was tasteless. They do not serve bread.It took forever to get my car from the valet parking. I won't be going back.
October 16, 2015|Apres-Theater|4|Nice, varied theater menu in close proximity to The Veteran's Memorial Auditorium. We went after the Philharmonic and the place was hopping. Good food, reasonable prices, and good service. I had a delicious grilled salmon and my son enjoyed the braised short ribs. Very enjoyable experience.
October 11, 2015|A place worth going out of your way for.....|5|Dino and his staff always are SO attentive and make every effort to make your dining experience memorable! From the moment you arrive to being seated strategically so you're not on top of the next patrons. The servers are always attentive and make certain to give you space to chat, but keep an eye on you. Food is interesting in both selection and presentation and there has not been a dish that has disappointed. On this last visit, we had creamy chowder, crisp fresh Caesar's salad and lobster ravioli with HUGE chunks of lobster in a sauce that wasn't too heavy.....just right! Of course, we had to squeeze in room for dessert and were not disappointed with a strawberry shortcake with a hint of lime. Again, it was light and tasty!
October 2, 2015|Warm and friendly service, delicious foo...|5|Warm and friendly service, delicious food that reinvents classics in a way that doesn't distract from the flavor. An awesome meal all around!
September 19, 2015|Excellent service and good food|5|Surprised it wasn't full at 7 pm on Sat night as the food was good (not huge menu but ample and fit for those with big and small appetites as well as meat eaters and vegetarians. Service from Hamilton was excellent - great attention (kept water glasses full, knew the menu and was accommodating for allergy info) without being intrusive. We've been to plenty of 'fine dining' establishments and our service Hamilton was right up there with the best! No one rushed us out either - very appreciative when visiting with friends.
September 5, 2015|Great Experience|5|Went here on a Saturday night based on reviews I read online. I was staying in the Renaissance and found the convenience, and menu, quite appealing. We ended up changing our reservation the day before to add two friends and adjust the time without issue. We were seated immediately at a table that was half moon shaped, which was great for our party of four. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly (though she did make it clear that she was tired of her job that night). She made good suggestions for food based on what other patrons had been ordering and the feedback she received. We were all very happy with our meals - steak was cooked well, the Cavatelli dish was not only beautiful but also insanely delicious, drinks were tasty. We even ventured into dessert which was delightful - cappuccinos were good, the Candy Bar was unexpected in the best way, Tiramisu and Cheesecake were great. Overall, it was an awesome experience with great food and attentive service. Would go here if I lived in the area!
August 29, 2015|Great Fun Before Show|5|Public Kitchen and Bar is located right next door to the Vets so it's a great spot for a pre-show meal. The atmosphere is high end yet very casual and comfortable. The bar was very crowded the night we dined and very energetic. We often like to sit at the bar to eat but unfortunately there were no seats. We were however seated immediately at a nice window both with a great view of the Statehouse. Our server asked if we were going to the show and made certain that the food and drinks were paced to get us there on time. Great service. The menu is varied and eclectic. Meals were served promptly and were delicious. I would highly recommend to locals and anyone visiting Providence.
August 29, 2015|Good food, slow service|3|40 minute wait for appetizer is unacceptable and it was salmon tartare!
August 29, 2015|A delight in every bite.|5|We had a great pre-show dinner. Our waitress was wonderful. Every bite of food was interesting and delicious! We started with lemon drop martinis and split the CHEF’S BAR BITES BOARD, which included tiny tacos with lamb and avocado spread, chicken wings, and croquettes -- all with several interesting dipping sauces. Also split the FIG N’ PROSCIUTTO pizza, which was crispy and tasty. Finally, split two desserts (GRAPEFRUIT CREME BRULEE and PUBLIC CANDY BAR) with cappuccino. No bite was anything less than wonderful. Thanks for a great evening!
July 9, 2015|Great food|5|My wife and I wanted something light to eat late in the evening (around 9pm). Their pizzas were incredible! A couple of days later we came back with our teenage sons for lunch and had another wonderful experience. Some of us had pizza again (different toppings). I had a lamb burger that was really excellent. I am not a fries person, but their fries were unusual: very crisp and lightly salted. Delicious. We will come back.

May 23, 2015|Good food|4|The food was excellent. They clearly didn't have a table for us as they kind of stuck us in an empty corner near the exit sign and were very confused when we first arrived. That said, food was delicious and service was fine.
May 22, 2015|A great find!|5|Typically do not think of restaurants located in a hotel, but Public is a great find. Great menu, excellent food. Highly recommend.
May 9, 2015|Nice menu.  The restaurant was a bit emp...|4|Nice menu. The restaurant was a bit empty which was a surprise but also allowed us to linger without feeling rushed. It is definitely on our return list!
May 5, 2015|Dinner and a Show|5|Dinner and a show is always a challenge - where do you stuff the car? how do you get from dinner to the theatre? PK&B makes it a dream - its like walking from a private dining room to the show in the living room. The food is inventive, but not off the map. The ambience is a little hip, a little chic, but not too hip that it makes me feel old or too chic that I might tip over some exotic table decoration. Noise is good on the edges - don't know about the middle.
May 2, 2015|Small place ... big tastes|5|The Public Kitchen, located in the Renaissance Hotel in Providence is the perfect place for dinner before a show at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The diverse menu will satisfy everyone's taste buds, and the pleasant decor is always inviting. Always listen to your server and pay attention to the daily specials as they are always uniqe and delicious. So stop by and enjoy.

April 19, 2015|Delicious food|5|Haven't been here since it was formerly Temple. I've been missing out! My girlfriend and I came for dinner before before the Brit Floyd show at the Vets. We started with the clams casino, had the paella and scallops as our entrees, and finished with the peanut milk creme brulee. Everything was amazing, and our server Jeff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommended.
April 19, 2015|delicious and convenient|5|Great spot before heading over to the Vets for a show. Food was interesting, different, and expertly prepared. Service was impeccable. Nice view of the capitol, too!
April 14, 2015|Very Good and Well Priced|4|Public is not one of Providence’s fine dining establishments, but it is very good and well priced. A good variety of choices. Nice Atmosphere.
April 10, 2015|Pre-concert dining|5|As always, before attending a RI Philharmonic concert, we dined here. Jeff was our waiter, charming and solicitous. We appreciate being quickly accommodated (changed our seats to preferred booth w/view of Capitol Building) and swiftly served so there was no pressure re getting to the concert. We enjoyed the food and appreciate the valet parking service greatly. We look forward to our return! Sincere thanks!
April 4, 2015|One of my favs|4|Fantastic restaurant, been there three time with three different groups. We love the chef's board, Lamb Shank, and soft slow cooked beef taco. I have three favorite restaurants in Providence, this is one of them. Try it.
March 28, 2015|Great service and great gluten-free options!|5|The Public Kitchen And Bar is a great place for dinner prior to a show at the VETS with complimentary valet parking. Our server Kelly, was wonderful and made sure the kitchen took extra care with my GF meal. Everyone enjoyed their meal selection.
March 27, 2015|Great food and View of State House from right seat|4|Something for everyone - My chicken confit rigatoni was delicious. The GF burger my partner had looked terrific and she said was extremely pleased. I tasted a frie - not one of my favorite things, but these were delicious. My daughter and her friend each had their own pizza and ate every bit - they shared an order of fries as well. Disappointed that we were not offered a wine/drink list - not sure if that was inexperience on the server's part or SOP. Regardless, we simply ordered a PG and PN, both of which, though not inexpensive ($10 ea) were adequate. All in all, meals above, two glasses of wine, one soda, and tap water came in under a C note before tip. We arrived 6:25P on a Friday for our 6:15 rez, were seated quickly. Service was good until we were ready for the check and our server was nowhere to be found. Another passed by and did help locate ours quickly. All in all, nice dinner and nice time. We'd all go back.
March 21, 2015|Great dinner right next door to Vets Auditorium|4|Three of us had a lovely meal prior to a concert by the RI Philharmonic. We shared two salads and each ordered an entree: one salmon, one braised cod, and one swordfish special. Each of them were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Altogether an enjoyable experience.
March 21, 2015|Just OK|3|Excellent host service. Comfortable ambiance. Convenient to the Vet of course. Cocktails disappointing - bartender ignored our requests. Chef's platter Appetizer was extremely over priced for quantity and quality of food. Entrees were good but not excellent. Again value for price didn't seem to be in balance. Did not get dessert.
March 14, 2015|Great Service - Great Food|5|First time diners. Dinner with 3 friends before attending ballet at The Vets. Great service from the valet to the coat check and everything in between. Our server was amazing - she found the right balance- knowledgeable on wines and food, very attentive but just the right amount, very engaging and friendly. All of her recommendations from apps to desserts were right one. Everything was delicious and everyone agreed we need to come back! Soon!!
Dined on February 14, 2015|A Big Disappointment|1|Unfortunately, this is my second poor experience here and I have only been here two times. First, the Valentine menu was very limited. Second, the food was extremely bland. I had the cod which was moist but very chewy. It had little flavor and the portion size was small. We also had the lobster ravioli which was good but not great. The value paid for our meal was not good as well. We had two salads, entrees and drinks and it cost $120. I expect a much better experience and more creative and flavorful cuisine for this price. Overall, the ambience was good but they are going to need to change the menu and increase the flavor and creativity in order really succeed.
January 31, 2015|Entrees lacking|3|Great service, interesting space, but the entrees are lacking. Specifically, entirely too many of them are Gluten Free and so only come with a veggie side. That makes the dish too small, and lacking in variety. They should instead give the option of Gluten Free on any dish, so that if you don't want it they give you a carb to go with your side of veggies.
January 23, 2015|Outstanding Find|5|I chose Public Kitchen because of its location, but what a lucky choice! The food was delicious, the service was great, and the restaurant itself was lovely. And, for 830 on a Friday night the noise level was manageable, so you could actually have a nice private conversation over dinner! It's just a short hop up the street from the chains at Providence Place Mall, so definitely take the stroll instead of settling for more of the same!
December 31, 2014|NYE|4|We visited for the first time for New Year's Eve. Public kitchen had a pre-fix menu that can be hit or miss in most situations but our entire group found something interesting to order and food was inventive and tasty and did not feel mass produced. We had an enjoyable night.
December 25, 2014|Good dining|4|We went on Christmas day since we waned to celebrate and not cook ourselves. the menu was the regular lunch offerings. We were pleased with the small plates and salads. Then when we ordered our burgers the lamb burgers were well done instead of medium rare. They were most apologetic and reordered them for us. The desserts were the right size and very good.
December 13, 2014|Night on the Town|5|Food and service were excellent, great place to have dinner before going to a show at The Vets
December 5, 2014|A celebratory spot for a great night with friends|5|We had a terrific meal at Public before the Demetri Martin show at the VETS. The location was obviously a huge plus, the staff was fabulous and accommodating, and the delicious food turned out to be a fantastic surprise. We ordered multiple salads and appetizers, creating a night of tapas. The flavor combinations, the presentation, and the quality of the ingredients were fantastic. The food was thoughtfully presented and prepared. Yum!! This was our first time at Public, and it certainly did not disappoint. The decor, staff, food, and location were all wonderful- will definitely be back!
November 22, 2014|Poor choice|2|"We made our reservation on Open Table and arrived right on time. The bar was full and we were told they were ""checking"" on our table. 25 minutes later we were seated in a almost completely empty restaurant! I already knew what I wanted since I had checked the menu on Open Table. Guess again, the menu was missing a dozen items that were online! Of course they were the ones I was most interested in. Ordered the salmon instead. Bland with no taste. Should have gone to Bravo 3 nights in a row!"
November 15, 2014|Before the concert|2|The staff seemed a bit disorganized as we arrived. They did not seem to know where to seat us. There were too many people that came over to ask us how everything was. I prefer just the waiter or to be left alone.
November 15, 2014|Great dinner|5|We went to Public Kitchen & Bar to have dinner before a concert. The food & service was great! Staff is extremely friendly & helpful. Always a pleasant time.
November 14, 2014|The Chef's Back!|4|Once again, we enjoyed a splendid dinner (with guests from Chicago) overlooking the Capitol Building before a superb concert at the RI Philharmonic. This time, the food was again as excellent as it had always been prior to our last visit. Our hopes for the return of Public Kitchen as one of our favorite Providence restaurants were completely restored.
October 25, 2014|Very Cool Vibe and View|5|Extremely convenient if staying near the Capitol Bldg. View of Capitol was amazing, as well as the service and food.
October 25, 2014|Recommend Public Highly!|5|"Public is a very hip and interesting restaurant made all the more interesting by being set in the lower floors of an old Masonic temple. The decor builds on this while still managing to look fresh and vibrant. The menu is built on a firm foundation of ""pub foods"" often given a foodie-friendly twist. For example, as an appetizer, we had sliders. Lobster sliders! It's little touches like this that set the menu at Public apart in a city full of great food. I would be remiss if I did not mention the excellent service. We have visited Public on several occasions, sometimes while they were quite busy. Every time, we were treated like the only customers in the restaurant. I struggle to find anything to criticize about Public."
October 25, 2014|I was shockingly surprised by the dishes...|2|I was shockingly surprised by the dishes we ordered... the half-chicken I ordered was so over salted, I wondered how something so obvious could have slipped by the kitchen. The paella dish we also ordered was seasoned poorly- entirely too hot without any real spice flavoring. I was hot for the sake of being hot and it lacked a thoughtful construction. Not only was a disappointed to sit down to such a meal, but $90 later I feel like I wasted money and time. I will never dine at this establishment again, and I will strongly discourage others the same. It was That much of a let down.
October 25, 2014|Creative cuisine!|5|Six of us had dinner at this wonderful restaurant in the Renaissance Hotel for a special occasion, and each of us was delighted with our selections. The food is creative, delicious, perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, and there is an array of interesting menu choices. Most desserts sound better than they taste, but not so with these desserts! Our drinks and wine were also excellent. The service was outstanding, and the ambience is quiet, relaxed, and quite pleasant. I would go back in a heartbeat, and I am particular.
October 17, 2014|What Happened?|1|We ALWAYS dine at PK & B before attending a RI Philharmonic concert and often bring guests. Our experience this past Friday night (10/17) was a shock. Usually, the food is a delight. Not this time. Hopefully, next time will restore our trust.
October 11, 2014|Great time|4|Everything about our night was wonderful. The ambiance, service, timeliness and food were excellent. They have a tremendous wine list with various price ranges. Kristen was a great server, very personable and friendly.
October 11, 2014|Farm to table|3|This is a corporate restaurant's effort to be farm to table. It's better than a burger menu.
October 9, 2014|A Must Before the Show|4|"Located in the Renaissance hotel, Public Kitchen is the perfect place for a pre show dinner. the menu is varied, the food is always very well prepared, and the portions are ample without being ""too much."" The service is attentive, yet not pushy, and the vibe is just what you need before heading around the corner to the Vets for a show."
October 3, 2014|Great Menu|4|We loved the eclectic mix on the menu and the tantalizing mix of ingredients. That being said, the food and the environment were not at all pretentious. It's nice to eat well without trying too hard. We would go back again.
September 27, 2014|Great find|5|Nice reasturant located in a hotel. A little off the beaten trail but well worth it. Food was good, beers were great, and ambiance was excellent.
September 22, 2014|Spicy Thai - OH MY!|5|A trip here just for their spicy Thai noodles is worth it. Chef blends coconut with other Thai flavors to create this wonderfully aromatic and complex dish. Delicious.
September 20, 2014|Excellent food but...|4|Busy evening and kitchen couldn't keep up with demand, so long wait. However, food was excellent and I liked that it was cooked to order. Also, wait staff worked very hard and was very professional. I wonder if they were understaffed.
September 19, 2014|Providence surprise|5|Great food and service. Inside Renaissance Hotel. Amazed at how slow it was considering how great it was. Locals I spoke with seemed to have no idea of the place and never heard of it.
September 13, 2014|Odd Place|2|My wife enjoyed her meal but pricing is premium for what you get for sure, Mine was salty as ever. Drinks and service took for ever and the place wasn't even half full. The experience was less than stellar for the look and prices. I sent an email to the place and it was ignored. If a place doesn't care about customers or opinions then I wont give them my money. I'm not surprised I didn't get a response as I saw a waitress arguing with a party, then the manager joined in telling customers they were wrong. Great business model. That party left mad and swearing. From the Valet to the bar to the management, the place was a nightmare the night we went, and they didn't even care enough to respond. Dont waste ur cash, many better places around.
July 26, 2014|Overall a good meal|4|We had a few minor issues (dirty silverware, food undercooked) but these were dealt with in a timely manner and the staff was very attentive. It was a little surprising to see so many empty tables in the restaurant on a Saturday night.
June 28, 2014|Great steak|4|My dinner was terrific, sirloin steak. My husband's fish and chips was just so-so.
May 25, 2014|Opinions |3|Had a wonderful dinner with friends. When the waiter was giving us the specials he was extremely opinionated. Made faces at the pasta selection called it boring, the meat selection was plain... Not a good way to start dinner. Overall we love public. That was just an area for improvement
May 24, 2014|Tasty But…|3|The menu was disappointing as it was no where near as elaborate as what is currently on Open Table. No short ribs, no seared scallops, no half chicken, no tagliatelle n' braised beef. I ended up with fish and chips w/parmesan fries. It was perfectly cooked, but not very exciting; the paper liner on the dish would tear when you sliced the fish as it soaked up the oil… Dessert was small and tasty - more of a tasting. Again, very tasty but not new or exciting. We had grapefruit cheesecake and strawberry bread pudding (needed more whipped cream; would have asked but by the time the waiter came back we'd finished the dessert). Not to discredit him - the service was excellent and attentive.
May 24, 2014|To Care |1|I ordered the lamb burger, which I often do when it is available at a restaurant that i go to, I was there with my father, I had just graduated college this past May 24th, the burger tasted fine, not great but nothing wrong with it either except that I ordered it medium rare! and it was medium to medium well, my server never came to check on the temperature and obviously neither the cook or the expediter double checked, the restaurant lunch service was not busy at all maybe a total of 4 more tables besides mine, both Brown University and Johnson and Wales graduating that day its surprising that it was so slow, it was my first time here and now I understand why it was slow. because no one in the restaurant cares enough .. which is a shame!
May 21, 2014|Management is failing the Kitchen!!|2|As our table ended up being in a private event space at the very rear of the restaurant, we walked through the well designed and attractive dinning room. Our table was in a sparse space that felt completed separated from the dining room; it took our server some time to arrive but he was pleasant but seemed overwhelmed. We had show tickets; but had allowed an hour and 45 mins and arrived early for our reservation. We quickly selected wine, appetizer, and entrée and informed our server about the show. It took 45 minutes for our roasted beet salads to arrive; and while we were finishing them another set of salads arrived but were sent back. Our entrees did not arrived until an hour and 45 mins after our arrival. Good food but POOR service
May 21, 2014|Avoid going before a show at Vets|2|Took over an hour to get our food and it wasn't cooked.
May 11, 2014|pleasantly surprised|5|great restaurant with nice ambience. try to get nook booth. food good and timely. would definitely go again. overall feels like a rich experience without being over the top.
May 9, 2014|Okay, but over-priced|3|My husband and I have been to Public Kitchen & Bar several times. The bar is convenient, as is the restaurant. Staff is congenial, but a bit perfunctory; our waiter at dinner lacked the professional 'edge' that is often found at $$$ locations (our waiter at breakfast was wonderful). The food at dinner was okay -- but seemed spare in its presentation and quantity for the price. Not sure I would return here...
May 2, 2014|Good Food Small Portions|4|Good food. We ordered a few dishes to share. Food was tasty but portions were small. I would recommend asking to make the small plates as large plate options.
April 29, 2014|Great on a quiet night!|4|We went early on a Tuesday, when the place had very few customers, and the server was very attentive and friendly. The food was really quite good - and we split a few of the small plates (tacos and lobster sliders) - which worked really well. The only disappointing thing about the menu was the complete lack of chocolate on the dessert menu; we opted for dessert elsewhere to satisfy our chocolate tooth. But the desserts did look great for non choco-philes.
April 25, 2014|Not worth the price|1|We had a 6:30 reservation on a Friday night. There were still people in the bar for after work drinks. The bar was so noisy that even though we were seated at the far end of the dining room, it was still too loud to have a conversation without speaking loudly, which only added to the din. Our server was very energetic (maybe a little over the top) but attentive to our needs. The by the glass wine list was ok, but nothing special. The beer selections were predictable and uninspired. The chicken wings were very good. I had scallops, which were perfectly prepared. However, while the food was prepared well, it wasn't worth the $100 bill at the end. We will not be returning to this restaurant in future.
April 18, 2014|Spectacular dining experience |5|This was our third time dining here. With a new menu to sample we tried the cold slit pea soup with creme fraise baby kale and cauliflower steak for apps. Amazing combination of flavors. Dinner was salmon with sides that shined. Lobster sliders were light and fun. Spicy Thai noodles as good as any authentic restaurant would make. That it had all these great combination for the non meat eaters in our group made it so enjoyable. Also a great drink menu and some amazing bourbons and whiskeys. Definitely a great place to sign or end a night in the city.
April 13, 2014|You've got to be kidding!|1|Just totally disappointing. The service was pathetic and our meals were so-so. I had really high hopes for this place but it wasn't anything special. Our waiter brought out plate after plate of cold unimpressive food that should have been served hot and our drink orders took anywhere between 25 & 30 minutes for 4 people!
April 12, 2014|Ate here a month ago and loved|3|Ate here a month ago and loved it- this time much less so. The pork was excessively salty and tasted a little lackluster. My friend had the supersalad and the fig-prosciutto pizza which was OK but somehow even that tasted better last time.
Dined on April 12, 2014|Service work needed|2|The food here is very good but the service was severely lacking, even with the manager intervening, it did not help. Had to leave before dessert was served even though they were aware that we had a concert to go to. This was our second time here, our first visit was flawless.
March 29, 2014|What a surprise|5|I have been to Public Kitchen on three previous occasions and have been happy each time, but on Saturday the staff and the food just knocked it out of the park. My party of 3 was not so happy with our table way in the back...but we have never had better service in a restaurant! The gnocchi and hummus for apps were perfect starters...the fresh pasta special literally had my friend saying it was better than a similar dish eaten at Alfornos for twice the price. The wine was delicious and the fact that the staff even sent over an extra wine for us to taste because it paired nicely with one of the dished-classy...and the candy bar dessert is a favorite (but serve it with a fork and not a spoon!!!). Truly a fabulous meal!
March 25, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. I would recommend the Spicy Thai Noodles!
March 22, 2014|Dinner in the city|5|The window seats with a view if the State House was beautiful. The appetizers were fabulous. The lounge area was fun and the bar area was comfortable. Valet parking made exploring a downtown restaurant delightful. Will definitely return
March 21, 2014|The picket line outside aside.....|3|Generally, a good experience with above average food quality (except for the ho hum makeshift Caesar salad) yet the waiter could have been more astute on the delivery and more timely on the service. The bar seemed to cause delay for the restaurant wait staff. I've always wondered why the hostess desk has three attendants, all delightful, but there were three!!!
March 8, 2014|Beautiful Atmosphere but...|5|The food was a bit pricey but you are downtown Providence so this is to be expected. I do not recall any entree, except the burgers, being under $23.00. With that said, the food was excellent. Very different in pleasing combinations to both the eye and the palate. However, the service was slow. I heard this from other reviews and hoped it was just an off night. No, sorry. They do not seem to have enough help. We had to track down our waiter to pay and when we moved to the bar, we waited a long time to be served. Not sure what's going on. They did have a DJ after 9:30 PM but the crowd was subdued. Maybe because it is connected to a hotel? Not sure. I would go back for the food and atmosphere but I do hope they step up their service.
March 6, 2014|Must try the PEI Mussels and Calms|4|The flavor is phenomenal! So incredibly savory, it will spoil your tastebuds forever. The pan seared scallops were also unbelievable in flavor and cooked to perfection. A nice veggie pair to it was the extraordinary Brussels Sprouts. Only thing from me giving a 5 star was the fact that they were missing an ingredient thy o their signature drink, Russian Roan which normally tastes like a liquid jolly rancher candy, substituted with another liquor and it tasted off. They should have told me from the beginning when I ordered my drink. I usually stop by for that drink when im in town and was disappointed when it didn't taste the same. However albeit, food was exceptionally good for someone like me who has discriminating tastebuds.
March 6, 2014|Unique and excellent|4|I never expect much from hotel restaurants but this one was great. So what pricey but fantastic food. I had a fresh made burger that was one of my best in months. I also had the most unique and fantastic clam chowder. My only gripe was it was $9 for a cup ( which they claimed was a bowl) and I could not afford to pig out on it.
March 1, 2014|Overall great experience.|4|Overall great experience. I thought the quality of the food was great, fresh and well prepared while not overly expensive. Decent wine selection and nice by the glass. Bar was very busy, nice tenders and wait staff. Although the service, very slow. I would recommend to others and hopefully be back some time soon
March 1, 2014|Good food, poor service|3|"This restaurant is adjacent to a hotel but has a separate entrance. They offer valet parking but when we pulled up, we were told they were full due to ""gridlock"" and had to find our own parking. The dining room in downstairs and has a grand feel to it. The food was very good but the service was exceptionally slow and impersonal...until it was time to pay the bill, at which point it was clear they wanted us OUT. I mentioned the service issue to the hostess and she seemed indifferent to it all. We would consider returning. Maybe it was just a bad night for them."
March 1, 2014|Perfect for Pre-show at Vets|5|We weren't expecting much, although the menu was very tempting. It turned out to be beyond our expectations (once we passed the very noisy bar). The food was imaginative and delicious. There was something for everyone - big meals, small meals, hamburgers, etc. The service was attentive, despite the busy-ness of the bar, which we could not hear once we sat down. The ambiance was pleasant but not overbearing. Altogether a perfect start for a wonderful night.
March 1, 2014|Nice surprise|4|We went because we were going to a show at the Vets next door mainly for the convenience. We were pleasantly surprised with a great meal good service and a very attentive manager, Mike. Server could have been more attentive but it was clear she was very busy that night. Overall a great place with a creative menu. Everything we ordered was very good. We will definitely go back.
February 28, 2014|went for 10 yr wedding anniversary|5|The service was fantastic. The food was awesome. We had he chef small plate board and everything on it was deilcious. My husband ate all the bbq wings and I ate the liver on a crostini. Out main courses we excellent. I had the Gnocchi which ended up being too filling. My husband had the short ribs and raved about it all night. We should had ordered the chef's desert board.
February 22, 2014|Great food and drinks, service a little ...|5|Great food and drinks, service a little slow but still great
February 21, 2014|Great atmosphere|5|Great for multiple occasions (bar scene, lounge, or dine). Service was top shelf along with their signature cocktails, food was delicious, highly recommend the short rib. Place is very clean and has been freshened up with a much classier style than previously (Temple). Complimentary valet too!
January 31, 2014|Noisy bar|3|"Two of us sat at the bar across from noisy and what appeared to be new bartenders. I think I saw the most amount of alcohol wasted as they continually spilt drinks, made the wrong ones, etc. I saw a server pick up drinks from the bar to serve to a table and actually put her finger in the drink to ""fish"" something out. No, she did not use a spoon or other utensil, nor did she ask for another drink to be made, but used her finger. The food was good and beautifully presented."
January 24, 2014|The proscuitto and fig pizza|5|The proscuitto and fig pizza was undeniably delicious. The truth, hipster chic without the I don't care attitude from the staff. Will frequent.
January 22, 2014|Went with a small group of|5|Went with a small group of friends, love the decor, service and food. Can't wait to go back. Everythhing was perfectt
January 20, 2014|Great Spot|4|I absolutely loved the look of Public Kitchen. It's so glamorous and I definitely see myself going back there. I went for brunch on MLK day at 11 with a small group of friends. The waitress let us order brunch food even though they were moving to lunch, as long as we all ordered from the breakfast menu. We were happy to do this! The only reason I am not giving a full five stars is because we were one of two parties in the entire restaurant and the waitress never refilled out waters! She was not very attentive after the initial order and I thought that was extremely odd given there were so few people in the restaurant at that time.
January 8, 2014|electic|4|elegant and subdued decor-menu more casual but inventive and diverse, has appeal for foodies and non foodies-location a little off the beaten path (except for theater next door)-looks like a great place for a quiet drink (except for theater nights!)-definitely would like to try other things on the menu there have been several different restaurants in this location over the last few years, all of them good
December 30, 2013|Front of the house great|3|It seems like they did all this work making the front of the house better from what it was but they forgot to work on the kitchen staff. Our food came out cold, the first two plates came out and then at least 5 minutes in between the rest of the party getting their food. They just don't know how to poach eggs here. Everything just thrown on a plate. Home fries were good at least. With so many great brunch places to go to in providence they need to fix some major issues. It's just another hotel restaurant. Our server was good she felt bad. She was on top of her game getting us everything else.
December 16, 2013|Great Food!|4|Love the food at Public. Service is always good too. Will go back.
December 4, 2013|We were a party of five. We|3|We were a party of five. We chose Public Kitchen because we were attending a performance at the VETS. The food was good. However, the portions are small, and the prices are high. It is more in line with what is offered in Boston restaurants. Providence area restaurants are much better than those in bean town. We would return if we were again going to a function next door.
November 28, 2013|Public Kitchen outstanding|5|We brought our family here for thanksgiving dinner. It was fantastic!! Great options that were all delicious. My kale salad was spectacular....especially because I do not like kale.
November 9, 2013|Great out of the way restaurant!|5|On a night when we were headed to see Elton John, we needed to find a restaurant that had a 5:30 res available. Open table listed this one, and it was great! Beautiful interiors, and easy walk to the DD center! Great new unusual menu; fantastic service! Loved it!
November 9, 2013|Exceptional|5|All in all, a wonderful dinner experience. The menu has many new and exciting choices. We have been twice and basically shared mostly appetizers and dessert with friends and family. We have had the burgers also and they were fantastic. We went the appetizer and pizza route so we could try a little of everything. On our next visit, we will order a regular dinner dish and narrow our choices. The service was exceptional with talented and very experienced servers who make everyone at your table feel like family. The hosts were very nice and came over to thank us for coming. I will recommend this restaurant to All my friends and family. Thank you again for such a nice time!
November 1, 2013|food was very good but service|2|food was very good but service was horrible. bar service even worse than food service. that's why I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to friends. It's a shame because food was so good.
October 18, 2013|Quick Public Thoughts|4|"Quite a different place from Temple. Not at all the ""men's club"" look that the newspaper reviews saw. I thought it was sort of funky. The changes are nice, however--sort of a refresh. Food is what one member called ""upscale pub grub,"" but they do some nice fare with interesting presentations on a wooden board. Some interestingly different wines, and a nice list of other alcoholic beverages. Service is still somewhat stilted, especially for such a high-energy mood coming from the bar area. I definitely will go back to see how they come along."
October 18, 2013|Food & Valet Before Philharmonic|4|We were delighted to see that the Renaissance Hotel (with a view of the Providence, RI, glorious Statehouse) found a replacement for the restaurant we always visited before a RI Philharmonic performance. If anything, the food is better than it was (able chef!) and the service was excellent (charming, informed waiter).
October 5, 2013|Wonderful|4|When you read the menu you expect to have a small portion size. Fear not, you will surely leave with a full belly. The staff here are polite, helpful and approachable. The ambience is warm and beautiful. The menu is full of American comfort foods with a foodie twist like deviled eggs with a trio of salts, loaded tater tots with brown gravy and a burger that was made of lamb instead of beef. The one and only downside we could think of it the food overall is a little on the salty side but otherwise delicious! If you're not too full make sure you get the dessert tray. It varies day by day but ours was loaded with more comfort foods like rice krispie treats, muddy buddies, mini creme brûlée and spice cake.
