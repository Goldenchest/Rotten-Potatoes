February 14, 2016|Chaotic on Valentine's Day|4|Little trouble getting good table because of crowd. Also, there was a mix-up on food but it was straightened out quickly. Overall, one of my favorite restaurants in PVD. Nice views from location on Seekonk River.
February 14, 2016|Valentine|5|Went in for a Valentine's Day brunch. Wasn't disappointed! The menu was wonderful, the service friendly and professional, and the atmosphere was perfect. There are enough vegetarian options, even on their smaller brunch menu. I will definitely be back for dinner, sometime.
February 13, 2016|perfect place for a special occasion|5|First time we visited Waterman Grill. It was recommended by a friend of mine who lives in Providence. I also googled it and read the reviews just for curiosity. My friend and reviews convinced me to make a reservation at Waterman Grill. Once we got to the destination, we thought it was somewhat odd, a restaurant out of nowhere but it was night time so it was difficult to see what's around the area but once we got inside, we were greeted with this fine gentleman who welcomed us with a big smile at the front desk. Though it was super cold outside, the restaurant staffs were warm and the place in general was inviting. The staff guided us upstairs and had us seated in quite candlelight intimate table. I loved it! It was nice and cozy. And then Brian introduced himself as our waiter. He was so attentive and very polite. Brian knows his stuff and were pleased with our selection. Food was superb and the butternut squash soup was to die for. When we finished our dinner waiting for our check, the light went out and only the candles in our designated tables were lit. And I said this is nice and romantic. It was just four of us left upstairs and the two young folks who were sitting next to us liked the ambiance. And then Brian said what happen to the light! I said I thought it intentional because of the occasion but he said they needed to fix the lightings. Overall it was very nice and plans to come back after the renovations. Please extend our thanks to Brian for making our experience delightful.

February 13, 2016|The food is excellent.|5|I had my son's rehearsal dinner at Waterman Grille this past August and they did an amazing job.
February 13, 2016|Special Day|5|This was a special occasion, my mother's 90th birthday. We got seated quickly and found a card on the table. The card was birthday wishes for my mother, and it was signed by the staff. My mother was delightfully surprised. Our server, Scott, was great and very attentive even though he was very busy. We had a couple of their Share Plates (the Grass-Fed Meatballs are awesome) and dinner was great. When it came time to order dessert my mother got another surprise. Scott served my mother their delicious Sky Bar dessert with happy birthday written on the plate. This is not my first visit to Waterman Grille, nor my last. Thanks to Scott and the staff for making my mother's 90th birthday dinner a special time. One side note. Everything was great, except for a very noisy table of 6, but it is what it is. Lack of respect for other diners. I guess they figured they were all alone in a very busy restaurant. There is no need for people sitting less then a few feet from each other to scream at one another. I am sure there is no easy well to tell ignorant people to shut-up without causing a bigger issue.
February 12, 2016|Perfect timing!|5|We had made reservations for the Friday night of Valentine's Day week-end, so we planned on maybe still having a bit of a wait given a completely packed house, but our table was ready, exactly as we had requested on the site. We had a fabulous waiter who was fun to chat a minute with and who helped us with a special order and lots of questions about the menu. Our meal was paced beautifully from the salad to the dessert, so we never felt rushed and had a few minutes in between courses to digest and think about what was coming next.
February 11, 2016|Excellent food, fantastic service|5|Waterman Grille is not the easiest to find as it's not downtown and not near any other eateries but it is just a short trip and is worth it! It is our local neighborhood gem tucked along the river that is perfect for special occasions. The food is on the pricier side but we have always, ALWAYS had excellent meals and service every time we have gone.
February 5, 2016|Service was outstanding! Everyone was ve...|5|Service was outstanding! Everyone was very courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. Ambiance was very nice, even with a screaming baby a few tables away. Our filets were both under-seasoned, and the char was a bit much for a med-rare cook. Temps on meat were perfect! Looking forward to tasting other items on the menu.
February 3, 2016|Changes|4|Last time we visited (2 years ago) we were very disappointed. We decided to try it again and we are glad we did everything was great from the service to the food It seems to us that they made several menu and staff changes since our last visit It now is up to a Newport Group Restaurant in my opinion
January 27, 2016|Great!|5|The restaurant, the staff and the chef,Noah were all remarkable. Our food was served looking delectable and the wait was not too long. Chef Noah managed to deliver 6 different dishes, with each one looking more appetizing than the last. We had a great evening!
January 22, 2016|what happened to your cooks?|2|all seafood were fine and fresh and well cooked: cod, scallops and swordfish. but the beauty stopped there: squash soup was like a dessert,: agreed, it's naturally sweet but that much of cinnamon? what do you want to hide? then crab cakes: more of a potato patty than crab, and worse: extremely salty!! what happened to your palates, chef and cooks? we thought we could catch up on the mezze plate? how can one get wrong with a mezze plate? go to any grocery store, you'll get more decent tabouleh, or edible hummus which tasted nothing like garbanzo bean nor tahini either. worse, it's jellyish! entrees were better, but canellini beans were not tender, and the polenta was tasteless. my advice: less is more. be modest, serve less items (on each dish and on the menu) but pay attention to each of them!
January 22, 2016|Excellent!|5|Quiet, especially if you request to sit upstairs! Food was excellent as well.

January 20, 2016|Excellent service, wonderful food!|5|Excellent service, wonderful food!
January 15, 2016|A night to remember!!|3|Great place, great food.Good service. Been there before always nice. We had a rude guy and his wife next to us who were very loud and vulgar, no ones fault but they should have been asked to leave!!
January 15, 2016|Restaurant weeks trying different places|4|Nice dinner we had a the Salmon was very good , unfortunately it was winter and dark outside. We will come back in the warmer weather the location is right on the water.
January 14, 2016|Great Meal on the Water|4|We went to Waterman Grille during restaurant week. The portion size was amazing! We both had split pea soup - huge bowl and very tasty. I had the sirloin steak - cooked perfectly and about 8 oz. My friend had a beautiful piece of salmon on a bed of spinach. - fresh and perfectly cooked. For dessert I had creme brulee - creamy and sweet and my friend had chocolate bread pudding. Although our meal itself was fantastic, our waiter Brian made the meal. My friend has a garlic allergy and he made a great recommendation to substitute the fixed menu accompaniment with spinach. He was there when we needed him and was very helpful and agreeable.
January 9, 2016|Fantastic meal|5|Had a delicious meal from start to finish---Cesar salad and clam chowder were both so good. My daughter had the filet and I had the burger and were great. The service was perfect. There to check in on you but not overbearing. We really enjoyed our experience.
January 9, 2016|Very good food|5|Loved the food. The service was great. The calamari was delicious.
December 31, 2015|Excellent food with a pleasurable atmosphere|5|We were seated in an appropriate time frame in association with the assigned time of our reservation. When we were brought to our table, we expressed that we would prefer a different table and, with no fuss from the staff, we were escorted to new table that made our dining experience quite nice. All of the food we ordered was prepared to perfection; of note was the polenta that was served with pan-seared scallops. My wife and I agreed that it may be the best polenta we have ever tasted. Also, the wine has a good variety of choices. Great food, wine, and service made for a memorable dining experience
December 31, 2015|Even though it was a busy New Year's  Ev...|5|Even though it was a busy New Year's Eve, neither the quality of our food or the service was negatively affected. We had a lovely corner table overlooking the river, and thoroughly enjoyed the oyster special, the arugula salad, and our entrees. I had the roasted cod...light , moist and flavorful ...and my husband was happy with his lamb shank. Great place for special occasions or to drop in on a Thursday night for the burger and craft beer special in the bar area.
December 31, 2015|New Year's Eve dinner|5|Waterman Grill is always good but on New Year's Eve to have a relaxing dinner, no rush, great service and fantastic food!
December 23, 2015|We have always had great service and exc...|5|We have always had great service and excellent food. Only negative is how loud it is in there. We were stuck next to people who clearly have no manners. Dropping swears and being overall inappropriate. Not Waterman's fault.
December 19, 2015|Waterman grill|4|Food was excellent, service outstanding. Atmosphere very pleasant. Drinks were pricey. I would definitely go again and recommend.

December 7, 2015|40th|3|I took my girlfriend here for her 40th birthday on December 7th. The service was inattentive and sub-par. The room was full of diners but only one waitress was on that night. I was terribly disappointed and spent well over $100 on the meal. For a restaurant with such a standing in Providence, this was unacceptable.
December 5, 2015|Great location /ambiance but oh so average quality|2|"There was a time that Waterman Grill was a great new find for us but is has unfortunately devolved into just another restaurant with average food and average service. It's too bad really becaus the location and atmosphere is tops. Waitstaff and hosts (especially) are just not into recognizing their customers who go there repeatedly and often. That could be somewhat overlooked, but with average food at best, this has just become one of those places ""we used to go to."" This past Saturday night we gave it another shot and both my wife and I agreed that this would be our last time there. It's just not that special in any way and so why pay good money for average food and average service. I hate to put this like this but The 99 is far superior in both quality and service. It's a sports bar atmosphere and if you don't mind that, you can eat far better and far less expensively and be greeted by hosts that make you feel like you're more than welcome."
December 3, 2015|Wonderful place to dine.|4|Upon our arrival, the restaurant was extremely busy, but we were seated immediately. It was my dear friends Birthday so it was a special evening. The food was very good, but the service could have been a little better. It seemed like there should have been additional wait staff on that night. We waited a long time for our meal and drinks. What is always a small but lovely perk is when the reservations are made that you ask if it is a special event. IE. Birthday, Anniversary, etc. It makes the experience a little more personal.
November 28, 2015|Special Night|5|When making our dinner reservation I had mentioned it was our anniversary. We were treated with a table right by the romantic fireplace and complementary champagne. The incredible service and the delicious food made for a truly special night. We will definitely be back soon!
November 28, 2015|Great meal|5|We hadn't been here in over a year. Dinner on the Saturday after Thanksgiving was delicious. Our server was great with suggestions and descriptions of the specials. We will be back again soon.

November 16, 2015|Consistent!|5|We have been to Waterman Grille a couple times now and both times, the quality of the food was very very good. The consistency is very nice to see. The ambiance is great, the place smells fantastic, very nice wine/drink menu. This truly is a great little neighborhood gem.
November 13, 2015|I haven't been there in a while and was ...|5|I haven't been there in a while and was pleasantly surprised at the high quality tasty food. Samantha was great waitress. She didn't rush us.
November 8, 2015|Nice pleasant evening|4|With the disastrous prior ownership behind them, the Newport group has taken this place where it belongs. A real nice addition to the neighborhood for almost any occasion. Thanks for turning this around.
Dined on November 7, 2015|Noisy and food problems|3|"This is a VERY noisy restaurant; tables are very close together and there is little to no sound absorption material. I've overlooked this in the past because I liked the food but this time the food was disappointing. I ordered the pork tenderloin, which came with a ""cauliflower puree"". I assumed this would be something like mashed potatoes (that's how I've seen it before) but essentially it was a drizzle on the plate under the pork. My companion ordered a salad and the scallops entree and the waiter brought a salad with scallops added--clearly not what she had ordered. By the time her entree came, corrected, my pork was cold. Altogether disappointing--especially for an $85 dinner check."

We were told the full menu was not available until 3:00. The food was good (limited to 4 sandwiches or breakfast items) - we will be back to try the full menu.
October 25, 2015|Always Great for Brunch|4|Just love having brunch here. the seats are cpmpfy, view nice, pretty place, food great, hosts always terrific and friendly and our server was lovely. We will be back soon.
October 24, 2015|Wonderful Time|5|Made a reservation here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and I can say we were very pleased with everything. Our server, Samantha, was warm and really paid attention to the food allergies my girlfriend has. She even ensured special requests made in Open Table were fulfilled. We tried plates we had never had before, the swordfish and filet Mignon. Overall a good experience. Should we ever stop by Providence again we'll be sure to stop back in.
October 23, 2015|First of many...|5|We have been patrons of the Boathouse for a few years and after discovering the Smokehouse this summer, decided we needed to check out the Waterman Grille. We reserved a table through Opentable, but decided to go a little early and grab a drink at the bar. We were greeted at the door and shown to some open seats. I had the Teachers Pet and my husband had the pineapple infused vodka on the rocks. Both were amazing and the service was excellent. The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect for our evening out, although there were a few larger parties that made it a bit louder than expected. Immediately after we were seated at our table, the waiter, Jason, welcomed us to the restaurant, asked us if it was our first time, took our drink order and referred me to the gluten free options. He was very helpful, professional, and informed. The GF menu was amazing! I was surprised by the vast selection, especially including the variety of dessert options, and was happy to hear that they will be expanding it to encompass even more of the traditional menu soon. We ordered the cheese plate as our appetizer, which included GF crackers, and it was a great touch after they brought it, he informed us of each component. A huge bonus was when he had a warm GF dinner roll brought out when the typical bread basket came to the table. These are the small things you miss at restaurants, when you have dietary restrictions. We chose the mac n cheese with duck confit and the vegetable risotto, both lived up to our expectations. We finally ended with the GF Almond Joy dessert, which was absolutely delicious, with a cappuccino and port wine. I am sure that this was the first of many visits to Waterman Grille. We are now trying to decide who to have join us on our next excursion, and have been telling everyone about our experience.
October 20, 2015|All around enjoyment|5|A beautiful view of the water, with crew boats rowing by. The food was outstanding, the service unsurpassable and the ambiance charming.
October 19, 2015|.  My experience|4|The food and menu choices was excellent. It was a bit too noisy for me though, but that will not stop me from going there again. Nice atmosphere and plenty of parking.
October 17, 2015|Lovely view and fine dining|5|I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner and prefer the dinner menu. The view of the river is lovely and the food delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked. While I am not usually a fan of polenta their preparation of it served with the scallops was tasty.
October 16, 2015|Great place but very busy and noisy.|4|Great place but very busy and noisy.
October 11, 2015|Good bet for brunch|5|Pleasantly surprised. This place is tucked away on the riverside. Great view. Went for Sunday brunch and had an excellent meal.

The muscles weren't anything great but the other stuff was soooo good. I cannot wait to go again. The bartender was the nicest guy too. The homemade bread there is delishhhh. We had a really nice time there :)
October 9, 2015|Recommend to Foodies|5|I love the selection here! I had the pan-roasted Atlantic Salmon with braised beluga lentils, shiitake mushrooms, haricot vert, and beet vinaigrette--and it was even better than it sounds!! We also had a really fun time here--we asked about a wine and a manager came over , talked with us, and described several options. We ate late evening, so we didn't get to enjoy the waterfront view, but it's a great location for an event.
October 3, 2015|Delicious food in perfect ambience!|5|Meze platter has THE BEST FALAFEL I have ever tried!!!! The restaurant was beautiful, service was great and food was very good....Cant ask more of a restaurant!!! I cant wait to go back on a hot summer afternoon to enjoy the view and more food.
September 28, 2015|We have eaten here in the past, and the ...|3|"We have eaten here in the past, and the food/service/ambience was amazing. Our most recent experience was not at all what we expected. We were stuffed into a corner table next to one of the few other couples sitting inside. When our dinner arrived, my wife's French fries (she ordered the burger, which was wonderful) were ice cold. She is not one to complain, and it wasn't until I complained to her that my own French fries were very overcooked/dry/crunchy that we thought maybe there was a problem with the fryer. We brought this to the attention of our waitress at the end of the meal, who offered to get us ""new"" French fries - an appropriate response if the matter is address at the beginning of the meal, less appropriate while we are eating dessert. Based on my previous experience and the price of meals I would have like to have received some consideration for the inedible fries we both received when the final bill came. Alas, that did not happen. There are too many wonderful restaurants in Providence for us to go back there any time soon...."
September 26, 2015|always good at the waterman grille|4|the waterman grille is always a good spot for dining and a good glass of wine. On a busy Saturday night the place was energized and tables were hard to come by, however the management is well versed in running a busy restaurant and the tables are turned efficiently without felling rushed. upstairs is a bit noisy , but , so what ? doesn't take away from the experience. Great TAPAS and small plates menu, to satisfy everybody's needs . Great Place
September 20, 2015|Very good|5|We had a very good time; the service and food was excellent. I would recommend to friends and would go back again.

September 13, 2015|Average at best|2|Unfortunately we had a new server who was not well trained. The food was average, she was unable to answer basic questions. We waited for our meal for over 90 minutes. Because we had a small child with us, after an hour I took him out and had my food brought home. We had hoped for a much better experience.

September 12, 2015|First time visitt|5|Went here for the first time. Megan was my server. She's great. Food was awesome and very reasonably priced. I will be going back. Staff is super friendly
September 7, 2015|Pure perfection in Providence|5|We dined outdoors and the scenery was gorgeous. Our waiter made sure every detail of our meal was perfect. He was very attentive yet not at all bothersome. The food was perfection. There is really no other way to describe it. We had an extremely romantic dinner. I will be back time and time again.
September 6, 2015|Great anniversary dinner with friends|4|This was our first time dinning at Waterman Grille. It was easy to get to with plenty of parking. We had reservations for 8 pm for six people. We arrived early for drinks and the staff asked if we would like to be seated early. Within 5 minutes we had a table. We enjoyed the 3 course special with the $10 bottle of wine for 2. The food was fantastic without a long wait for it to be served. Our waiter although very courteous he could not sufficiently answer questions about the menu. We ended up getting appetizers we did not need, but still very tasty. The restaurant manager was very courteous as well and asks several times how everything was. Although the bar was pricey the rest of the menu prices were on point. We will definitely go back and have already suggested it to friends.
September 5, 2015|Good experience previously|2|We have been here a couple of times previously and have had great meals. This time however, my entrée wasn't that great, but the mini meatball appetizer was outstanding. The service was good and they were very accommodating with adjustments to the bill, as well as giving us a dessert on the house for the inconvenience. Overall, the Newport Restaurant Group is great, this experience was just a fluke.

September 3, 2015|Disappointing|5|We love the Waterman Grille, so I thinking this could have been an off night. Scott our server was amazing. The bar was backed up which caused a delay in getting our cocktails. It was the last night of the summer menu, which meant no alternate choices. My dinner was a bit over cooked, and my husband's scallops were gritty. We opted not to send them back since it was a busy night. We will go back once the winter menu is in place, and hope it is the Waterman Grille we enjoy.
September 2, 2015|Mom loved it|5|My 89 year old mom was delighted with her dining experience. The staff was attentive and helpful. She needs a walker and the hostess went out of her way to escort her to the ladies room. Mom was well satisfied with her meal choice and the interesting view by the water. Overall we had a lovely time.
August 30, 2015|Nice restaurant with great views of Seekonk River.|5|Pleasant atmosphere with tables on deck overlooking river. Food and service were great. Highly recommended.
August 28, 2015|Great location right on the river.|4|We sat on the deck right above the river. Great spot. Nice just to relax and watch the ducks, swans, sea birds and a surprise appearance of a harbor seal. Drinks were good. Food sounds fantastic but it falls just short of wow. 5 stars for creative and a good reason to try Watermans. The menu changes during the year and always has something interesting to try on it. We had three Share Plates. Best one was the Chicken & Biscuits. Excellent! The other two were just OK - Mediterranean Plate and Shrimp Fritters. A little expensive night out so we go once or twice a year.
August 22, 2015|Great Experience|5|Normally I just eat and don't pay much attention to food quality, but Saturday my dinner was something I continually tell everyone I meet about. The food was extraordinary and I actually finished everything. The dessert was good,but did not match the dinner.The service was top notch. The server was knowledgeable about the entire menu and wine list as well as the entire property and the history of the resturant..
August 21, 2015|Excellent food with good gluten-free options|5|"We tend to come here for special occasions - it's nice to eat on the river, and watch the sun go down. The food is really excellent, and the gluten-free options are much more than the ""re-heated Udi roll with a burger on it"" - really delicious meals that also happen to be gluten free."
August 20, 2015|I ordered a white sangria, which was disappointing|3|The sangria was flat and tasteless (was it the wine? the juice?). My friend's drink of gin with black raspberry was also disappointing. Something was/is drastically missing in the drinks. The salmon (my dish) and the swordfish (my friend's) were also disappointing. They were edible but very mediocre. We had so look forward to our dinner as our previous experience was good. This was terribly disappointing.
August 19, 2015|A great place|5|We had a fantastic evening at the Waterman grille. Food was great not fancy but tasty and generous. I must comment positively on the staff we were seated next to a really loud group of 10 it was a full but the noise was awful when I asked they moved us quickly and with no fuss. I really appreciated how accommodating they were and would go again in a heartbeat!
August 17, 2015|We celebrate here!|5|Great food, great service,great wine list. We have never been disappointed. Try the lobster mac and cheese, it is outstanding !
August 15, 2015|Good spot|4|Great ambience with a varied menu for all. Can be pricey, but worth a periodic stop. Solid local spot.
August 15, 2015|We were married here 11 years ago and re...|5|We were married here 11 years ago and return to celebrate our anniversary. It will always have a special place in our hearts. Food was amazing, service was exceptional, love sitting outside with a view of the river. Was introduced to ricotta donuts......to die for!
August 15, 2015|Our server did everything absolutely per...|5|Our server did everything absolutely perfectly. We got there around the same time as a big party so the kitchen was backed up, but she made sure to keep us updated, make sure our drinks were full, and that we were happy. Perfection.
August 15, 2015|Brunch|5|Great choice for outdoor seating and brunch menu. Had the crab cake/egg special and it was outstanding! Will be returning soon to taste some of the standard brunch menu items.
August 14, 2015|Waterman, again|5|Our 4th or 5th time at Waterman Grille. We've never had a bad meal. We'll keep coming back until we have a reason not to. We dined outside this time. The evening weather was perfect for it. Our server was very pleasant. Food was outstanding, as usual. We sat back and thoroughly enjoyed the evening.
August 14, 2015|What a find. Who knew?|5|This place is awesome. Doesn't appear that way as you approach the restaurant but it's lovely. The outside dining was very nice by the river. Great ambience and great service. The food was awesome, especially dessert. If you are in downtown Providence, you must have dinner here.
August 12, 2015|Good food, poor service.|3|"Came here w my fiance to celebrate our anniversary on Aug 12. Our food took a little long to come out. We were actually pondering on whether to leave or not. Our waitress did not come to our table to check up on us or to let us know what was going on. The only reason we knew the food was taking a while was because we overheard another waitress at another table telling the couple that the ticket machine was down. Our food finally came out and the food was worth the wait, however. Our waitress did not check on us. I envied the other tables because we saw how much attention they were getting from their waiter/waitress. When it finally came down to pay we were waiting over a half hour for our waitress to see that we were done. At this point I wanted to walk out and pay at the front. She was nowhere to be found. And when she finally came, gave us our check, and we paid, we hadn't even left the table when she proceeded to grab the check and tip! That's so rude! It was as if she was waiting for the tip, which I told my fiance to not leave one because the service by her was so rude. Idk if it was because it was near the end of the night and she wanted to get out of there but she should not be waitressing if that's how she treats her diners. No name introduction, no ""how are you guys tonight?"", checked on us a grand total of 2x the entire night, and takes the check from our table as we are getting up! Ive already told several people about the service and I don't think they'll be coming here. Idk if I'd come back. Id only come back if that waitress never serves us again. Will say that the one gentleman who served the table in front of us was excellent. The experience would have been so much better if our waitress was doing her job better."
Dined on August 8, 2015|A lovely summer evening of dining with friends|4|As a member of nearby Narragansett Boat Club, we row past this great waterfront restaurant daily and its always full of people. The menu covers all the food groups and has a nice vegetarian menu on their main dinner menu. I had sea scallops cooked to perfection over polenta. Delicious! Other members of our party had duck; vegan; and salmon and all were not disappointed.
August 2, 2015|Nice Setting with Good Food|4|Family members gathered for Sunday dinner at the Waterman Grille. From beginning to end it was a nice experience. The server was prompt, attentive and at no time did we feel rushed.. The menu included a number of nice choices including a fixed price menu with three courses for $28. Everyone enjoyed their meal. This was our first time to this restaurant and we would be excited to go back.
August 1, 2015|Pricey and so-so|3|I wasn't impressed with my expensive beef filet. My husband said his yellowfin tuna was quite tasty. And there's not much the restaurant can do about the noise level, but it was pretty noisy. If you're looking for a quite, intimate spot, this isn't it.
August 1, 2015|My friend from out of town come here for...|4|My friend from out of town come here for the Lobster mac and chesses. He had the same dish last year when he was in Rhode Island and the restaurant used both the tail and the claw meat. However, this time the restaurant only used the small pieces of claw meat for the same dish. He is very disappointed.

July 25, 2015|Very nice|4|The duck was wonderful. Try to sit outside of weather is nice. Service was wonderful.
July 19, 2015|Enjoyed Sunday brunch...|5|Dined outside with my child for Sunday brunch. The food is always great, I wanted to change my normal order of the waffle, so I went for the Waterman eggs Benedict instead. I wasn't a big fan of the amount of pork loin served on the dish. You get so much pork loin that it's overbearing. I'm more a fan of bacon. Needless to say most of the pork loin went uneaten. Other than that everything was perfect!
July 18, 2015|Loved the restaurant's ambiance.|4|Loved the deck where we ate. Both inside and outside atmosphere was cozy and warm. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable and patiently explained the dishes we had questions about. Very nice, good food, would go back again.
July 18, 2015|Outstanding - all around|5|Where to begin? Dan - our server - 5 stars out of 5 - timely - helpful - patient. Next - the food could not have been better - good portions - great texture and taste - and the presentation was pleasing to the eye. I was with three guests who live and dine frequently in Boston - they could not name a restaurant they have eaten at in Boston where the food was better.
July 18, 2015|Just ok.|3|Facility is very nice but on the river with a dreary view. The other side of the river is a blighted undeveloped area that is nothing to look at. The food was ok but the menu is somewhat limited and the food was ok but not exceptional. Some dishes were over cooked. Server was ok but nothing special. We would not return. We had dinner the night before at Hemenway's and that was far superior in food and service.
July 18, 2015|Great atmosphere and food!|5|Great atmosphere! Enjoyed the Providence Restaurant Week deal! Nice menu. Food is a little different from what you'd get anywhere else.
July 9, 2015|Lively and declicious|4|"We didn't know it was ""Beer and Burger"" night when we made reservations, but the restaurant was hopping when we arrived! The service was extremely prompt, and the food was delicious. Waterman Grill is consistently good - in fact, very good!"
June 24, 2015|Beautiful night and great food|5|My husband and I went to dinner here as part of our anniversary trip back to Providence (where we met). The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. J got the prix fixe menu (meatballs, chicken and sky bar for dessert - amazing!) and I ordered mussels and gluten free penne and shrimp. They even brought us some champagne! This was my second visit and J's first, but we will certainly return again.
June 23, 2015|First Visit to Rhode Island|5|My sisters and I were visiting Rhode Island for the first time. Open Table highly recommended Waterman Grille and we agreed with the recommendation. The food, service, and attentiveness of the staff were outstanding. We tried several of the small plates, entrees and desserts. We loved all of them! If you are visiting Providence, you must dine at Waterman Grille. P.S. The Mooring located in Newport is outstanding also!
June 21, 2015|very good brunch with family|4|small historic space with good food. right on the river. tight quarters but not uncomfortable to me. would recommend.
June 20, 2015|Great restaurant|5|The oysters were so good. I would go back just for those. The service was very good. We enjoyed the view. The scallops were nicely cooked and beautifully platted.
June 20, 2015|Great wait and food runner  staff and good food!|5|I loved the tables on the water. The wait staff was attentive, as well as the food runner, who waited a brief moment to make sure all was to our satisfaction . The wait staff came over several times to make sure all was good. It believe that is key to the success of a restaurant.
June 16, 2015|Outdoor dining the way to go|4|I chose the Waterman Grille to celebrate my partner's birthday with another couple. With the reservation I requested a quiet corner near the river our if a nice evening, outside. With showers in the forecast, it was clearing when we arrived for our 7 p.m. reservation. We were shown to an inside table with a river view in as quiet a corner as they had but the noise level was very distracting and not at all to our liking. The waitress was very accommodating to leave it up to us to move outside knowing of the possibility of rain. She agreeably set up a very nice and quiet outside corner table which was exactly what I had in mind as the backdrop to our dinner. The server was fabulous with just the right degree of attentiveness, as was our meal - a combination of orders from the 3 course special menu and the full menu. Three hours after arriving, we left the restaurant feeling totally satisfied and delighted with the restaurant, the food and our server. Based on the noise level on this Tuesday night, I would probably not choose this restaurant again unless we could be guaranteed outdoor dining. I can only imagine what it would be like over the weekend.
June 14, 2015|Cute, quaint, charming|4|Limited menu/ They ran out of the entree I wanted (Newport Benedict) by 1:15. The replacement was tasty, but nothing memorable (Eggs Benedict). Fruit on the side was hard, unripened mellon with one sliver of watermelon. Boring, unimaginative...not at all impressive. My friend got the cassoulet, which was a much better order. It came with tasty toast and also sides of her choice. Server was absolutely terrific.
June 14, 2015|A Pleasant Brunch, as Always|5|The sunrise basket is always good. The bellini's are nice. The omlette had good color, good texture, and good height. The roasted red peppers in the omlette were full of flavor. The Italian sausage was not fatty nor grissly. Megan, our waitress, was pleasant, attentive, and jovial.
June 14, 2015|Very Good|4|We enjoyed Sunday brunch. We had a lovely table outside with a nice view of the river. Service was a bit slow as they were pretty busy. I had the special of the day which was a Mexico dish with pulled pork and scrambled eggs and cheese in a tortilla...,very good. the prices were reasonable for the quality and food portions. I would recommend it and will be going back.

June 7, 2015|As always the food and drinks are great!|5|I heard about this place from a friend at work. Im always out in Providence and figured I would give it a try. That was two years ago and i have been going ever since. Dinner, lunch or brunch. All great in my opinion, food is always great!! I would recommend this place to all! Enjoy!
June 6, 2015|We're repeat customers as we like the pl...|5|We're repeat customers as we like the place very much - never disappointed.
May 30, 2015|Date Night|5|My fiance and I had a wonderful dinner here. The mussels appetizer was delicious to the last drop with 2 large grilled pieces of bread for soaking up the addictive broth! I had the duck and my fiance had the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly. I would recommend both entrees. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. We finished our night off with a few cocktails at the bar. I would highly recommend the pineapple doli and an expresso martini.
May 21, 2015|noise level was difficult|3|wonderful except the loud table near us which made it difficult to speak and hear ourselves and nearly wrecked the experience.
May 14, 2015|I took my friend there for her birthday ...|5|"I took my friend there for her birthday dinner because she expressed an interest in dining there since she had never been there but had heard fabulous things about the food and service. I, too, had never been there so it was a fabulous find for the two of us. We entered into the restaurant for our 5:00 p.m. reservation and passed through the bar/high top area and heard the happy chatter of Happy Hour participants. We were escorted to the inside dining area and seated at a table for two with a water view. If the weather was warmer we could have sat in the outside dining area. Our waiter, Dillon, was efficient and charming and answered all our questions regarding various items on the menu, particularly ""What is whelk?"" The food was delicious and the fried apple dessert was scrumptious. We will be back again."
May 9, 2015|The WG is a great place, the food is alw...|5|The WG is a great place, the food is always top notch as is the service. Family of four, two really enjoyed the hanger steak,third had delicious scollops and the fourth enjoyed the statler chicken. Appetizers were mussels in a tasty coconut sauce and calamari with banana peppers, both were very good. The setting is very nice, exposed brick walls and dark wood or perhaps you sit on the deck overlooking the river. Highly recommended.
April 26, 2015|Great for Brunch with Friends|4|Breakfast burrito was only so-so. The bread basket continues to outperform. The Newport Benedict as well as the bacon side were exceptional. The Bellini and the Bloody Mary are a great value
April 24, 2015|Waterman Grille|5|My boyfriend and I love this place the food is outstanding and the service is great. The setting is very romantic with dim lighting. We had the oysters for an appetizer, the short ribs, and the filet mignon as entrees. Everything was delicious. The best part of the meal is the almond joy dessert. I would highly recommend this restaurant
April 19, 2015|Great Vibe, Affordable Prices|4|This was the first time dining at Waterman Grille. It won't be the last. Researched dining options online since we wanted to get dinner before a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center at 7 pm, and settled on Waterman Grille among the many dining establishments in Providence. Our server, Prana, was friendly, accommodating and outstanding, handling multiple tables with flair and efficiency. We ordered from the 3-course options (what really sets this apart from others is that you get a good bottle of wine for the table for only $10 more) ... a great incentive. Appetizers (meatball and butternut squash soup) were fine (although we noticed a much larger portion delivered to a diner who order off the main menu.) But that's OK. The main course (pork tenderloin) was more than plentiful (suggestion: go with the chef's recommendation to have it cooked medium) ... But the salmon was a little short on volume. Again, not the end of the world since I found the $28 per person three-course price to be well worth it. We ended up taking our dessert to go since we were pressed for time ... the creme brule/cookies combination worked perfectly two days later, Add the lively vibe to the dining area ... as well as the bar in the other room, and it was a very satisfying experience. We look forward to the summer when the outside deck will be open for our next visit. Definitely check it out.
April 19, 2015|We love waterman. Had the short rib brun...|5|We love waterman. Had the short rib brunch special and it was amazing. My poached eggs were hard which I hate but my fiancé changed his with mine. Welcoming staff at the front door. Only small negative was my bloody didn't have the usual amazing spiced rim that it usually has. Still amazing and great views.
April 4, 2015|Perfect|5|Waterman is always a favorite tonight they did not disappoint. We were celebrating a milestone birthday. We had an excellent table, wonderful service and were gifted our desert which was served with a birthday candle- wonderful touch! We had the Filet which was cooked perfectly. As well as a nightly special the Salmon- again excellent.
April 4, 2015|Easy to Relax and Enjoy Saturday  Brunch|4|One great feature of going to the Waterman Grille for brunch on a Saturday with friends from out-of-town is that you can make a reservation and that reservation is honored. You are brought to your table on time, the view of the river on a sunny day is inviting (even with a chance to see crews rowing), and the menu for brunch gives an array of choices that meet anyone's palate. Each of us selected a different entrée that were well prepared; all of us had a Blood Mary which were delicious. The best part of the brunch was the relaxed atmosphere and the fabulous service. It was clear that from the hostess to the waiter and the manager, that everyone at the Waterman Grille wanted us to relax and enjoy our time together -- WE DID!
April 3, 2015|Wonderful dinner!|5|Delicious dinner with a great view of the water! We celebrated our anniversary here and had a wonderful dinner! The bread was amazing too!

I was impressed & will return!
March 28, 2015|Rhode Trip Satisfaction|4|"My adult niece, Meghan likes to visit places seen on the Phantom Gourmet and we have done many rode trips to such places from MA to places in New England....just because we can. Depending on the amount of ""jingle"" in our pockets depends on how close to home, N,S, E, W we go. We drove from MA to RI specifically to dine here and not once did we regret any one of those miles as we drove from home to Waterman Grille. Baked swordfish and filet mignon entrees with both a scrum-deli-icious chocolate/peanut butter desert and equal type of apple crisp deserts.....we all agreed each bite in each dish was like separate orchestra tunes in our mouths. This is definitely a place I would make reservations if I had to for my Last Supper!!!"
March 26, 2015|We miss the Perin Cote Du Rhone|5|We miss the Perin Cote Du Rhone which was priced with $ 21 per bottle. It has since been rplaced with a Concha Y Torro Castillo de Diabolo costing $ 28 so $ 7 more for a lesser wine.
March 15, 2015|Lovely setting|4|Our second time meeting friends for brunch here, and it didn't quite match up to our first experience. Two of us enjoyed the cassoulet very much (though the beans were a bit al dente), but a frittata and breakfast burrito were less spectacular. They seemed to have changed the menu a bit and didn't offer as many gluten free options. The Bloody Marys were also less potent and flavorful, despite being advertised as chipotle infused. Our server was efficient but a bit less than engaging. We did have a nice table by the window overlooking the water, which made for a nice setting. Varied menu and reasonably priced.
Dined on March 14, 2015|Recent Dinner with Mixed Reviews|3|Waterman Grille has been a longtime standby for us so I am reluctant to criticize it. I enjoy the ambiance there, including the interior decor, the cozy fireplace and in particular, the porch-like dining room on the river. At our recent visit, the Autumn Salad (though the name might be freshening up as it is now March) was so delicious and tasty - pickled craisins! - so good), and my scallops with barley entree was quite good. My companion's entree, shrimp over pasta, had no flavor, it was bland and uninteresting, a big disappointment. He mentioned it to the server (we are not complainers, and never comment like this, but it was so bad he thought feedback would be helpful). We were a little disappointment that there was just no attempt to make it right, no apology or regret was forthcoming. I think we will likely give it another try because we've been going for years and usually like it. But I would recommend against this particular dish.
March 14, 2015|We enjoyed incredible food ~all delicious.|5|Our dinners were incredibly well balanced and beautifully presented. We each ordered something different and each one was enjoyed. Our server was very attentive (without being overbearing) and we are looking forward to our next visit. Experience could not be improved upon!
March 14, 2015|As always|5|As always, a great brunch, or lunch, or just on a hunch.
March 12, 2015|Food is always a delight.  Service top notch.|5|Waterman Grille always aims to please. Excellent staff. Subpurb food, Unique drinks and an excellent full wine list. Make for the perfect evening.
March 8, 2015|Always excellent! A neighborhood gem!|5|I am never disappointed at Waterman. Always great.
March 8, 2015|Brunch selections are tasty.|4|The Sunrise Bread Basket is quite tasty and is ample for several persons. The scrambled eggs in the tacos were well done, good texture, good color. Whoever cooked the eggs knew when to take the eggs off the heat. The Newport Benedict had great aroma and mouth feel. And the Berlinis were yummy.
March 6, 2015|Very enjoyable evening|5|We had an excellent dinner at the Waterman Grille with everything from the starters to the dinner (swordfish and fish taco's) and desert were great. Our server was very friendly, very helpful and she was provided great advice. We will definitely be back and we like the atmosphere/dining area.
February 22, 2015|Couldn't have asked for a better experience.|5|I called In with dietary concerns and they went above and beyond to accommodate my request. My husband and I had a wonderful evening.
February 15, 2015|very enjoyable dining experience|5|Service was excellent, great menu, our particular dishes were very enjoyable, good wine list, scrumptious dessert!
February 14, 2015|Just Righjt|4|We dined there Valentine's afternoon, in a snowstorm. Understandingly the restaurant was quiet, but not deserted, We had a table with a view of the river, and it was beautiful. We had the cheese sampler as an appetizer, and it was delicious. The fish and chips were good, but the batter coating was a bit thick for my taste. The creme brule' was billed as maple flavored, but lacked both maple flavor and any other real taste; very disappointing. Overall, the Waterman Grille was a great choice, and we enjoyed it and will go back.
February 14, 2015|Wonderful Valentine's Day Brunch!|4|A friend suggested a brunch outing for the 3 couples, and I looked in Providence (easier parking/access for all). TripAdvisor reviews were good, and once we arrived, we saw why: friendly welcome, nice looking place, table right by the window, with views of the water (sea ducks & , mergansers swimming around). The $5 Mimosas and Bloody Marys were great, the bread basked filled with amazing baked treats (mini muffins, croissants, all delicious) and our server was wonderful. The chicken & waffles was much loved, so were the potato pancakes. We couldn't resist desserts, so we tried @: the apple and the chocolate ones, both beautiful!

February 10, 2015|Attentive Service & Delicious Food|5|Our waitress Jenna was extremely attentive and nice. LOVED the buttersquash bisque. Perfect cure to a cold winter night.
February 8, 2015|Daily Special Special|5|All at table had the daily special for Sunday brunch- recommended by server. Great suggestion ! Everything great as usual.
February 5, 2015|Nice Evening!|5|Service was exceptional! The food was good and well presented. This place is definitely a repeat.
February 4, 2015|hidden gem|4|A great spot on the river if you want to avoid federal hill crowd. Plenty of free parking. Food was tremendous from the bread to desert. Specials were delicious and price point was like a restaurant week. You have to stop by and try it yourself. Finally, the place had plenty of energy for a Wednesday night.
January 23, 2015|First Visit-GREAT|4|Cozy and great food-first time here and everything was great. Had Med Plate to start and it was huge. Swordfish was ooutstanding
January 17, 2015|Another win|4|Waterman never disappoints. the food and service were very good. We ordered off the prix fixe Restaurant Week menu and the manager was very helpful with wine pairing suggestions. The dessert options were the only part of the meal that were a little lacking, but not enough to prevent a return. Nice spot -not quiet, but an energetic vibe and great views of the river.
January 17, 2015|Our table was ready as soon as we arrive...|5|Our table was ready as soon as we arrived. The food was delicious and each course was delivered timely. We never felt like we were being rushed and certainly never felt like we were forgotten. The waitress was excellent and checked on us often.
January 17, 2015|Great food, great service|5|We had the greens with fried goat cheese, butternut squash soup, salmon, mac-and-cheese with duck confit, and the almond joy dessert... didn't leave a spec of food on a single plate. Wonderful! And the service was great as well. Remarkably crowded for 5:30 on a Saturday, so do make reservations! By the time we finished, the restaurant was full with several waiting for tables.
January 16, 2015|Magan....|5|....in addition to all that I previously mentioned....'Megan' our server was an absolute GEM!
January 12, 2015|Always great!!|5|Everything was great as always!! Service is spot on, and the food is delicious!!
January 11, 2015|Everything's fine, except the noise level.|4|Creative menu, excellent service and an interesting view. Everything one wants in a restaurant, except that when the place is half-full or more, the noise level makes conversation difficult to impossible. Best to dine early or late.
December 27, 2014|Romantic spot|5|The space is inviting, our service was personable and attentive, and our food was extremely flavorful.
December 20, 2014|Great meal|5|We went for an early dinner. Great service and not one bit rushed. The food was outstanding and overall a wonderful experience.

December 6, 2014|Midway between Boston and Mystic|5|"My wife and I live in Mystic and have both friends and family in Boston. It is a great midway point to share a wonderful meal with good people. We go at least three times a year. We used to play roulette with ""the Hill"" and while we seldom had a bad meal, we have a comfort with Waterman Grille. Warm and comfortable, great selection of beer, the menu changes enough that we seldom get the same thing although we are always tempted. Duck Duo and the Lobster Mac & Cheese are two dishes I could order again and again (and again)."
December 3, 2014|HappyPeople|5|Always great in every way! I live the Waterman Grille.
November 29, 2014|Love Waterman Grille|5|Waterman Grille is our rotation of Providence area restaurants. We've never had a bad experience (except the company we brought last time- she was a piece of work). We ordered the mushroom spring roll and cheese plate for appetizers. Both were great! My wife always orders the lobster mac and cheese- it's enough for 2 meals for her. I had the pork tenderloin which was cooked to perfection. Service was great. Looking forward to next time!
November 29, 2014|Good wait staff, regarding service, speed & manor|4|Good selection of Gluten Free items on their GF menu. Wait staff was good with service, speed and manor. Food was very good, low lighting, and décor was pleasant with a view of the river. Only draw back is the washroom is on the lower floor.
November 25, 2014|excellent food...beautiful ambiance in the grill|4|lovely outdoor dining... restaurant is quite beautiful....quite noisy
November 22, 2014|Neighborhood gem!|4|We've eaten here numerous times. Usually, it's fairly quiet. Will avoid Saturday nights at 7:30--too noisy. Hangar steak, salmon, short ribs and mac 'n cheese are all outstanding. Service is always excellent.

The chef even came out and apologized which was a nice touch. Tried the homemade limoncello for dessert which was outstanding. Overall great. Love waterman.
November 17, 2014|Cozy ambiance - delicious food|5|Great location with a nice menu selection. The 3 course dinner special is a real bargain and highly recommended. No matter how many times I visit, I always come away knowing I'll be back!
November 15, 2014|Great if you are in a hurry...too bad we weren't!|2|We all wanted to love Waterman Grille since it's in a great spot and a very nicely preserved building with a fun atmosphere, but our Saturday night dining experience left us wondering how this place receives so many 4 star reviews. From the minute we were seated in the upstairs dining room for our reservation, we were hurried along by our server. Things were so rushed, our appetizer arrived about 60 seconds after we placed the order. Surely, this can't be our plate? Oh, yes it is! The rest of the meal progressed along these lines, too. It wouldn't have mattered so much if the food was amazing, but some dishes were better than others and some things arrived not as ordered (rare vs. medium). Our cocktails were the best part, but we didn't get to enjoy them much since the food was flying out of the kitchen so quickly! We decided to go elsewhere for dessert for a more relaxing experience. We were in and out in under 55 minutes. I understand needing to turn tables on a Saturday night, but that was a bit ridiculous.
November 6, 2014|Best Burger|5|Thursday night is 10.00 cheeseburger and a beer night in the bar. Place is packed, loud and lots of fun. Make late reservations on Open Table and avoid a wait. Hard to believe staff are so energetic and helpful and kitchen is so quick.
November 1, 2014|Historic building on the river|5|This was our first experience using open table and all went smoothly. our girls go to PC and we tend to go to atwell st or mall area so we were thrilled to try something new. Service was superb and food was outstanding!
October 31, 2014|meal|5|Soooo easy to make a reservation, food was very good and service was with a smile.
October 26, 2014|Delightful experience|5|It was too cold to sit outside, but we had a window table with a lovely view of the river. All four of us found the food to be delicious, from the wild mushroom spring rolls and the butternut squash bisque to the best hanger steak my husband ever ate, and the wine was superb. The service was outstanding. Reasonably priced for the overall excellence.
October 26, 2014|Great service. Food was great and drinks...|4|Great service. Food was great and drinks. Love when they have brunch specials in addition to the menu. Gives regulars a few more options.
Dined on October 26, 2014|Enjoyed Sunday brunch|5|Took our son there for Family Weekend Sunday brunch. Great food - eggs/crabcake benedict, french toast, butternut squash soup. Great service. Very courteous when I requested (and received) reservation change. Sat by the window and enjoyed the water view. Will definitely be returning on future visits to Providence.

October 24, 2014|Great, but a bit crowded|4|We have been here once a year for the past few years. And we will come again. Always very good food. It seemed a touch louder than usual, and got a bit warm in the dining room. It was parents weekend at the local college, so that may have played a part. Overall highly recommend it.
October 12, 2014|presentation|4|The service was good but the presentation was sometimes... let's say, surprising.
October 11, 2014|Very good food, vibrant setting.|4|We had a very good meal, with three different entrees, all well-prepared and served in a solicitous and professional manner. The restaurant was quite busy but, with well spaced tables, our party had no trouble in talking and hearing. One quirk that could be remedied is the absence of beers on draught. Although the bottled options were extensive and well-chosen, it would have been nice to have some local/regional craft beers on tap. A good option outside of central Providence, and with a nice, varied menu that delivers superior dining.
October 9, 2014|Consistently great for food and service ...|5|Consistently great for food and service both. Always enjoyable.

September 21, 2014|Loved it!|5|Loved everything about this place. Sophisticated, yet comfortable. Great food. Sunday night prix fixe with wine was wonderful. Our waitress was exceptional -- explained the different dishes, friendly and made the whole evening enjoyable. Worth the trip to the location, which is a bit away from things. Well worth it. We will definitely be back! Fried chicken special and hangar steak were excellent!
September 21, 2014|A reputation well deserved|5|My fiancee and I had heard wonderful things about the Waterman Grille. Everything we had heard was absolutely true! The food was delicious! The wine list was impressive. And our server was fantastic! She was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about both the menu and the wine list. We look forward to dining again at the Waterman Grille.
September 21, 2014|New favorite spot!|5|I was looking for a nice place to take my family who were visiting from out of town. I stumbled upon Waterman Grille, and I couldn't be more pleased! My only wish is that I had found it sooner. It has a beautiful deck with water view. It was raining while we dined outside, which was so relaxing. The food was amazing and you can't ask for a better deal than the price-fixe menu.
September 20, 2014|FIve star|5|A perfect evening: you can sit in or out, the service is amazing, the food superb, the wine list deep - had a wonderful Trimbach with our scallops and tuna mains...the first courses and desserts (Guiness stout cake and berry cobbler) all wonderful. The service is perfect: friendly but subtle and not intrusive. It was a great evening. We would go back if we lived near!
September 16, 2014|Great all around|5|Really enjoyed our dinner and glad we chose the grille. Next time we are in town, will return
September 15, 2014|A nice surprise|4|It was a little bit of a drive off of the highway, but worth it. I have a lot of food sensitivities and the staff was very concerned and attentive to my needs, which was really nice. The menu is not extensive, but what they do is done well. I highly recommend this restaurant.
September 11, 2014|never a bad meal|5|We sat on the outdoor heated deck overlooking the river enjoying a leisurely meal with great, but unobtrusive, sevice . Food was delish!
September 8, 2014|Conversation impossible, fine food|3|The three-course special menu offered interesting choices - the chowder was especially tasty and the salmon was nicely presented. But the NOISE LEVEL, oh my. Conversation with my dining partner - sitting facing each other just over a foot apart - was simply not possible for the first half of the meal. Really need to do something to control the noise.
September 7, 2014|Lovely choice for brunch|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our brunch at Waterman Grille. The food was well prepared and tasty and the menu provided for a great balance between breakfast and lunch choices, making it a great choice for a group. Our one disappointment was the constant blowing of air from the vent directly above our table. Although the staff did make adjustments to the system, it was still quite distracting and the temperature inconsistency was uncomfortable.

September 5, 2014|First visit, won't be the last !|4|Our first visit to the Wateman Grille was great! The outdoor seating was perfect, the service was very good and the food was amazing. The wine was very good, although we ordered a 2007 Jordan Cabernet, they only had a 2009. (The menu should be updated regarding this availability.) We look forward to going back & recommending it to others!
September 4, 2014|By the waterfront|4|My husband and I picked this place based on other reviews. It was very romantic with a nice view of the river. I had the special watermelon and heirloom tomato salad and my husband had the kimchee ribs, both very good. For dinner we had the duck duo and hanger steak, also extremely delicious. The best course was the dessert. I had the strawberry rhubarb crisp and my husband had the creme brulee. They were both exceptional. We are excited to return.
August 31, 2014|Great Dinner|5|Had a super experience for dinner. Brian, our server, was knowledgable, courteous , and respectful of our time. We never felt rushed. The food was exceptional and we would go back again without hesitation. The only concern we had was the temperature in the restaraunt. A bit cool for our liking, but would not keep us from going back.
August 31, 2014|Dinner was great|4|I believe our server's name was Brian. He provided very very good service to my wife and I. Brian was very attentive to us, he suggested calimari and it was fantasitic, and he suggested a nice bottle of wine for us. My wife said later on when we went out how good our aiter was this year, and the last time we went to waterman. We are very happy with the waterman griller, its our 2nd anniversary, and the second time we went to waterman. Please say thank you to Brian for us. he is great!
August 30, 2014|Great ambiance|5|Waterman Grille came heavy recommended and didn't disappoint. The food was great, the service friendly. We were on time for our reservation but when we got there they told us they were running a bit late and said we could wait outside (I guess the bar was full). That was my one gripe with the place but they made up for it with the quality of the food afterwards.
August 27, 2014|Found the food to be delicious as always...|4|Found the food to be delicious as always. Dining on the deck was delightful. Waitstaff attentive and timely.
August 27, 2014|Gary & Jan|5|"My law office was about six feet away. We patronized the establishment, almost daily: from ""day one."" Because of its location, I always thought it to be a destination restaurant - it sits alone along the river. It's a beautiful spot; but you have to want to go THERE. It has become a better and better establishment. It was great from the beginning, but it needed ""time' and it developed into a fabulous place: and also suitable for parties of many sizes AND ""smallish"" outdoor weddings. I am so pleased to walk in and see it ""buzzing"". It seems that patience paid off."
August 25, 2014|Love the location|5|Very nice place to be on a warm Summer evening. The rowers on the river provide an interesting view. My meal was great but my two guests did not care for the angle steak too much.
August 24, 2014|WOW!!!!!!|5|I have been going to Waterman Grille for a few years now and am always satisfied. I do recommend this restaurant to everyone I talk food to.This was the first time my husband and I tried the pre-fixed meal....what a find. Not only was the service, view, and food terrific, but the wine was wonderful as well.

August 23, 2014|Wedding Anniversary Dinner|5|My wife and I celebrated our 28th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful dinner. Our waiter was attentive and had a great personality. The restaurant went the extra step and offered us a champagne toast on them. A little treat that went a long way.
August 19, 2014|Hidden jewel|5|My co worker recommended this quaint hidden jewel. At first I thought we was lost as we headed down Waterman ave but we found it. The views were spectacular as we walked towards the door. We requested a table as close to outside as possible but inside, it was a bit chilly. We started off with the pork bellies a first for both of us. It was the best thing I have ever eaten! I never had pork bellies before and I have to say the chef made me a fan. I had the Filet Mignon, again this was the best meal I have had in a while, don't tell my wife! She had the beet salad and the duck which she raved about. For dessert, the creme brulé was on point. All in all great service, great meal. We will be back.
August 18, 2014|Always a treat|5|Once again, a nice dinner at a local restaurant. Getting very popular- use Open Table.
August 16, 2014|Tranquililty for A Lovely Brunch|5|Sitting on the deck, in a quiet spot, watching the swans and rowers on the Seekonk River provided a perfect spot for a wonderful brunch with friends. The services was excellent, especially because one of our diners has a nut allergy and the carefulness of what was done to accommodate this was top notch. The options on the menu for brunch are strong, with a couple of surprises that captured the summer flavors of Rhode Island. Service was attentive, not over-bearing and we were not rushed which allowed our gathering to catch up on each others. Perfect tranquil spot for brunch in August with friends...highly recommend the Waterman Grille.
August 14, 2014|Disappointing|2|This is an attractive restaurant in an interesting setting along the Seekonk river, but the quality of the food does not match the ambiance or the prices. The appetizer my husband and I shared was quite good - the harrissa meatballs. However, my husband's fish entree was mediocre at best and my 'vegetable calzone' was terrible. This was not a calzone but a panini of a sort. Heavy fried bread that was charred in places and very tough. The vegetables inside were quite tasty but there was no more than three tablespoons of filling in the whole thing. Most was unfilled fried tough bread. The service was OK but pretensious, as though this was such a superior restaurant we should be honored to be there. With better food we might have been.
August 13, 2014|Waterman Grille|4|Service was great and friendly. Food arrived quickly, and was delicious. We were a bit late for the reservation, and the hostess was very accomodating.
August 9, 2014|Perfect Spot!|4|My boyfriend recently took me here for my 21st birthday dinner, Everything we got was fabulous! we sat outside and had a beautiful view of the river it was beautiful and romantic, we will definitely be coming back here.
August 9, 2014|Perfect night!|5|We had a beautiful spot outdoors, and the service was impeccable! Each course was delicious, but the pork tenderloin special was a stand-out. We will definitely return!
August 8, 2014|Bland!|2|Food was very bland! I have been here a few times in the past and it has been very good. This time I was not impressed. There were also many open tables... Not sure I will be back
Dined on August 7, 2014|Nice dinner - would suggest not giving t...|3|Nice dinner - would suggest not giving the prix fixe menu to dinners on non prix fixe nights as it does not feel like a good value to pay more for the same meal a night later...
August 7, 2014|Very pleased|5|Great service, very good food and drinks and a nice view. We will be back!
August 6, 2014|Great food!|5|My grand son recently recommended Waterman Grille to me for my ladies night out. So I went. The food was fabulous and portions were good too. I highly recommend it for a good time out.
August 3, 2014|Great for Sunday Brunch|4|The food and presentation as well as portions were all excellent. The service was very nice and the wait staff was happy and accommodating. I liked the fact that we were not rushed. I have also recommended this restaurant for private parties, and they always consistently do a great job.
August 2, 2014|delicious and fun birthday dinner!!|5|I made a reservation for our youngest daughter's 21st bday with her older sister and her BF who were in from florida. they are all foodies but we also wanted to dine in a special, intimate location so we chose waterman grille and we all loved everything! reservations were confirmed a few times (the weather wasn't nice out and we had requested an outdoor table) and everyone was so pleasant and nice and helpful. we ordered a couple of appetizers for the table and drinks that were also delicious all around, and then ordered our dinners which included the delicious burger, pan roasted salmon, pork tenderloin, skirt steak and pork belly tacos! sadly, no room for dessert this time, but we cant wait to return!
August 1, 2014|Back again|5|This is at least our 4th time at Waterman Grille and they have yet to disappoint us in any regard. The service is genuinely friendly. The quality of the food used is top shelf and the preparation gives homage to that initial quality. Sitting inside, it can be a little loud but I've never felt that it was to the point that I couldn't carry on a conversation with my fellow diners. I've been to four of the eight restaurants in this amelgomation and they all seem to keep quality as their prime directive.
July 27, 2014|The appetizers were great, the dessert w...|3|The appetizers were great, the dessert was good. The entrée (statler chicken & avocado risotto) were very disappointing. I didn't care much for the menu selections. The service was very good.
July 26, 2014|Always a good choice|5|everything was great, what more can I say? We were offered a seat outside without requesting it specifically. The food was excellent (it was Providence restaurant week, and there was a great special menu with extremely reasonable prices and good choices).
July 21, 2014|Don't judge a book by it's cover|2|"Service is always a bit hit and miss - really cute place - reserved was shuffled and was shoved into a corner on the deck over looking the river- dressed casually - underestimated the group (with CEO of a major RI industry who frequents Waterman - but reservation was under my name who was in from out of town) regardless - hit and miss - felt as if they wanted to push us out. Food was good but I think I won't go back when I'm in town - coffee was offered with the check (can I get u some coffee? Here's your check - ""(never mind that desert was served 20 minutes prior). I visit my Providence friends often from NYC. It will not be my first choice. We will go to Gracies instead."
July 21, 2014|Prix Fixe|4|Outstanding Prix Fixe menu with wine. Great food, reasonably priced.
July 20, 2014|Lovely Dinner|4|Just the right spot for an anniversary dinner. We dined outside by the river ...the evening was a bit windy, and I wished we had chosen to dine indoors..the view is just as nice...the indoor atmosphere is cozy, charming and romantic...beautifully decorated Food was nicely presented...we chose the 3 course dinner with a bottle of wine. My chicken breast was dry and not so flavorful -a little work is needed to perfect that dish. My partner's steak meal was excellent. The service was superb. All in all a very nice experience.
July 19, 2014|5 star dining|5|The Waterman Grille is a great spot. From excellent food and service to a beautiful outdoor deck with pretty views, this spot is just wonderful. They also have an upstairs function room for private intimate setting and a function room downstairs which is just beautiful with a private bar. We eat here often and they never disappoint.
July 13, 2014|Delicious|5|I went to Waterman Grille on Sunday evening during Providence restaurant week with my brother. The food was divine, every bite left me wanting more. Just like the food the drinks were equally as delicious. The pomegranate mojito is the perfect summer drink! Our waitress was delightful, attentive but not too invasive. A great evening out. I will definitely be back.
July 11, 2014|Waterman|4|"This was our first time at the Waterman Grille. We happened to dine during the ""Supermoon"" so our view was even better than most. We had a 9:30 reservation on a Friday night and we were able to sit outside with a view of the moonlit river. The food was excellent, we started off with the Cheese Plate and the Confit Pork Ribs. Both were large portions for the price. My wife got the Short Rib entree and I had the Duck Duo. I was disappointed in the Duck Confit because I was expecting a thigh/leg instead of the meat already shredded. Unfortunately the confit was very soggy and bland, but the duck breast made up for it. Other than the confit, the food was very impressive."
July 11, 2014|Great Outdoors|4|Waterman Grille was a great place. The wrap around deck over looking the river could not have been any more romantic (we happened to have a full moon that night). Our waiter went out of his way to bring us exceptional service. The food was creative, but it did lack some flavor. I will, though, be returning!!
July 11, 2014|Neighborhood gem|4|Excellent food, fine service, a bit noisy, but with a view of the Seekonk River
July 11, 2014|Nice first visit|4|First time here....very nice experience. Food very good, service was excellent.....a very nice evening!!
July 10, 2014|an old favorite|5|love the deck overlooking the river watching crew teams.. food is reliably excellent yet not boring after years of eating here. Servers are well-trained and attentive but not cloying.
July 7, 2014|Superb!|5|Our server was clearly a professional, who had a great command of the menu. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the view.
July 6, 2014|Celebrated my birthday and could not  ha...|4|Celebrated my birthday and could not have been more pleased.The food and ambience was top notch
July 6, 2014|Outstanding!|5|The food was fantastic, well thought-out and our server was terrific.
July 6, 2014|Excellent|5|I, my wife, mother and Auntie stop here on our way home from Boston, MA. Their greeting was very friendly and considering our experience in Boston with their rudeness this was very helpful. The waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was GREAT!!! I would definitely eat here again if ever in Rhode Island. Thank You
July 5, 2014|Restaurant was clean and food delicious....|4|Restaurant was clean and food delicious. Will definitely recommend to friends and go back.
July 5, 2014|Great Breakfast|5|Keep coming back to the restaurant for breakfast. Good quality meals. Great value.
July 4, 2014|Exceptional service|5|Really enjoyed our evening here! From the bartender to the waitstaff everyone was fantastic! The lobster macaroni was amazing as were the tacos. It's clearly a local hot spot too as we sat next to two differ to groups who frequented there.
July 3, 2014|Waterfront gem|4|The best Rhode Island style calamari I have ever had. Very professional service. The deck on the river is fabulous.
July 3, 2014|can't wait to return|4|Had a lovely evening, food was great. Outside patio looked very nice and would love to eat out there next time we visit. Service was also very good. Noise level a bit high but worth it.
July 3, 2014|Dining experience|4|My husband and I tried the Waterman Grille for the first time on our anniversary. I wanted some place special with a view. I had the swordfish which was excellent, cooked just right. Said it was over a slaw but wasn't sure what the veggies were. My only complaint was that it was a little too gourmet for me. My husband had a ceasar salad with chicken and he raved about that. The prices are a bit high for going there regularly but we will try the special sometime soon.
June 29, 2014|Al Fresco|5|We were meeting out of town friends and a RISD student and looking for a nice place for brunch. Open Table had Waterman Grille on their outdoor eating list. What a delight. AWSOME food, great staff, good view of the river and walking distance from RISD and Brown at the end of College Hill. Beautiful restaurant,inside and out. Try the bacon Bloody Mary (yes, really!)
June 29, 2014|Lovely location, good food|4|The location is really the selling point here, but the food is fine. As far as brunch went, there were a few missteps - why would my sweet challah french toast be served with wilting pea shoots instead of maybe a sprig of mint? And why is my fruit salad mixed together with the homefries on a side plate? But the mains themselves were quite good. Our server was fine - a little awkward but polite and ready to help out with whatever we needed. It's a really beautiful place to have a nice meal; the views can't be beat. I've had dinner here and been much more impressed by the food at that time of day.
June 26, 2014|perfect evening.|5|My girlfriend and I went to the Waterman Grille for our 2 year anniversary and it was simply a perfect evening. The food was great, our service was excellent (gave him a great tip) and the atmosphere was without complaints. No question we will be back here again.
June 22, 2014|Food|3|The waterman steak was so tough it was inedible. If it dropped it would bounce. It just went home to the dog. It also had very little flavor.
June 21, 2014|Everything you've heard& more|4|Was initially turned off because we arrived on time and our table wasn't ready, even though there were empty 4 seaters in the restaurant. Parking: huge lot, easy and free. Apps: pork belly tacos are the BEST! Calamari was good! Entrees: sweet potato ravioli with shrimp was sooooooo good! The lobster mac and cheese is good, nothing exceptional, and it's heavy. Opt for a half portion. Be sure to ask for a water view seat that does not have the AC blasting on you. We got really cold throughout the meal. Overall good restaurant, great service, even better food.
June 21, 2014|Handicap Inaccessible|4|Having hidden disabilities, to use restroom was a struggle. Down a flight of stairs, take a rt, another rt, down a hall a lft, then a rt. What??? There was no choice, that's what I did. One sign, saying WC. Took me a minute to think water closet. The outside dining overlooks an ugly river facing east.
June 20, 2014|Date night|5|Our date night was fantastic. The menu has wonderful selections and food that is always impeccably prepared.
June 14, 2014|Excellent experience|5|Our table was waiting when we got there. The view is beautiful. The food, wine and service were outstanding- as always.
June 14, 2014|Awesome|5|We had a beautiful day to sit on the deck and enjoy the view. I had the Duck Duo, which was excellent, and my girlfriend had the pork shank, which she enjoyed.
June 3, 2014|Private Dining at its Best|5|Located at the top of the building, The Loft is the perfect spot for private dining. There are plenty of windows and a warm, toasty fireplace so you won't feel like you're in an attic. The staff including our waiter, Jay, and GM, Vinny, were extremely attentive & accommodating. I was able to add some tasteful birthday decorations to the room prior to our scheduled dinner reservation. They even made sure to help us surprise the birthday girl. GM Vinny made sure to check on us and the birthday girl during our meal to make sure everything was perfect. He truly is one of the most attentive GM's I've ever encountered. Between the gourmet dishes and 5-star service, Waterman Grille truly is a remarkable space to hold a private dining event.
June 1, 2014|On the water|4|Although the banks of East Providence aren't the prettiest, Waterman Grille is really one of the only nice restaurants on the water. I love sitting outside. The food is good and the manager is always walking around, happy to cater to your needs.
May 30, 2014|Excellent Gluten Free Menu|4|My husbands and I always go to Waterman Grille, not only for its consistently great food and atmosphere, but they really take care of my gluten allergy from the start. Their gluten free menu is excellent, and they have also been able to modify food on their regular menu to accomodate me. We have never been disappointed.
Dined on May 27, 2014|By the Seekonk|5|We thoroughly enjoyed the prix fix offerings. OUr server - Brian - was very professional and attentive.
May 27, 2014|My Anniversary|5|This is such a great restaurant! Went there with my husband for dinner, food was fantastic as always and the extra touch of champagne that was sent to our table was perfect for the occasion. Thank you.
May 23, 2014|Excellence at this lovely eatery|5|Set on a riverbank in East Providence, the Waterman Grille does not disappoint.The food is imaginative but not pretentious and altogether delicious. The shrimp and sweet potato ravioli, salmon and scallops are standouts. We will definitely return.
May 18, 2014|Excellent!|5|Great find for foodies and families. Awesome service, great location, and incredible food at reasonable prices. The Waterman Grille supports local farms and is a gem in Providence.
May 18, 2014|Enjoyable lunch at Waterman Grille|5|Four of us enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch on the terrace at the Waterman Grille. Everything we ordered was fantastic, and service was great.
May 17, 2014|Saturday night with family|3|The ventilation on the inside was horrible, kitchen grease smell so we asked to sit outside. Server was very nice and did her best but drinks took forever to come out (over 20 minutes) and when they did it wasn't all together. Almost every item on the menu came with several funky ingredients or sides.
May 17, 2014|Lovely evening|5|We had a lovely evening at Waterman Grille. Erica was our server and she was just terrific - very knowledgeable and attentive. The only negative was a noisy large party but eventually they left and it was much nicer - nothing the restaurant could really do about that!
May 17, 2014|Waterman grille|4|Excellent food good gluten free pizza. .....great atmosphere ... Good service ...good time
May 16, 2014|Waterman grille the best |5|The management is absolutely the best in the business. Everyone from the hostess to the servers are so attentive and lovely. The food is always on point and always exceeds our expectations. Fabulous fabulous fabulous
May 12, 2014|Best of both worlds|4|This was the perfect spot for my husband and I. I love seafood, he does not! Their shrimp and sweet potato ravioli was divine and the Filet was succulent. Cannot go wrong. Try to get there early for outdoor seating, that's what we were told. however, there were empty seats that we did not get even though we asked. Its my only discontent because I did request it in my reservation and they said it was full when we got there ( they said it cannot be reserved and its first come first serve). Other than that, the service and food was excellent, you cannot go wrong with this spot!
May 11, 2014|Exceptional Food and Service|5|Was there for Mother's Day Brunch. Wait staff was very professional and made every attempt to ensure our visit was comfortable and that my family was made to feel special. Food was great. The filet of sole, lamb and omlettes were excellent and my family enjoyed the fresh fruits and variety of pastries.
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day brunch|5|We had Mother's Day brunch on Sunday and it was beyond our expectations!! The food was great and there were plenty of selections. The wait staff were exceptional to us, not just our server, but any of the servers there went above and beyond to make sure our brunch was enjoyable. Our sincere thanks to all for the best Mother's Day!!
May 10, 2014|great food & service|4|Our server was very nice, so sweet and accommodating.. Managers came over to make sure our food was what we expected. Tables are close together so it's hard to have conversation
May 9, 2014|This was an excellent dining experience....|4|This was an excellent dining experience. I was presently surprised that parking was plentiful. The drink menu and wine list was great and everything that we ate was very good.
May 9, 2014|Worth The Trip!!!|5|We had a little trouble finding the Waterman Grill, it is located a little outside of the city center. Once we got there it was great! The location was scenic, next to the river. The restaurant has a casual feel with and elegant menu. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinners (scallops with butternut squash risotto, steak, grilled chicken with vegetable hash and caesar salad. The specialty cocktails and wine list was outstanding! The service was excellent.
May 7, 2014|Great Service|5|I wish I had noted the name of our server. She was outstanding. The food at Waterman Grille is always good. I really appreciate the gluten free and vegetarian options menu. If they don't give it to you when you are seated- ask your server for it.
May 2, 2014|So much good in a noisy atmosphere|2|All that is good with the Waterman Grille...excellent food, reasonable prices, in a location with a great view, is undone by a noise level so high it is enough to deter us from going back. Our group of four literally had to raise our voices to hear each other. No carpeting, no drapes, no tablecloths. Not a soft surface to be found to absorb the noise. If you're looking for a quality place to party, this is the place. If you desire a quiet dinner, forget it; go somewhere else.
April 29, 2014|Excellent|5|This was the first visit for my aunt & uncle who along with me thoroughly enjoyed the prix fix menu. Our server - Matt - was very attentive alone with his colleagues and professional.
April 27, 2014|Worth a visit|4|Great atmosphere. Cozy yet classy. Food was excellent. Service was top-knotch. Will be back to try the downstairs bar with friends.
April 26, 2014|Interesting Menu|4|The appetizer menu was very appealing and the fried calamari was very yummy! Entree menu was a bit disappointing in that often we liked one part of a dish but not the other parts. Pork tenderloin was juicy and flavorful but lobster mac 'n cheese needed more cheese and the lobster was a bit overdone, although good. Will definitely return to try some more dishes.
April 21, 2014|Outstanding!|5|The Waterman Grille is always a great place to go with friends! The food is fantastic and the services is even better. Thanks for always great service.
April 20, 2014|brunch|3|Interesting historic building, view is of river, not pretty or scenic. Went for Easter brunch while visiting son at college, food was plentiful and tasty, staff was very friendly, but a bit expensive for location.
April 16, 2014|dependably good food and service|4|It's a dependable spot with very good food and a nice view.
April 13, 2014|Great experience|5|The service was amazing, the food was so good, there was really nothing bad at all, we can't wait to go there again.
April 13, 2014|the food and service was fantastic.|5|the food and service was fantastic. i was my first time. my family and I loved it.
April 12, 2014|ACF Chefs from out of town|5|We were a group of American Culinary Chefs who went out to eat after a long day at our conference. Our ages ranged from 22-80.So cooking for that kind of group is extremely difficult. But the staff both foh and boh were amazing.
April 12, 2014|Smokey|3|Restaurant was very smokey to the point where our eyes were burning. Very uncomfortable 2 Braised short rib dinners with gnocchis was so overcoooked and tough. Service however was very good. We will not be returning.
April 12, 2014|Another great meal at the|5|Another great meal at the Waterman Grille, they cater to my dietary needs every time and the service is fantastic ...!!!
April 5, 2014|Nice treat|5|We chose Waterman Grille to treat some friends out to eat. We wanted to show our appreciation for their helping us out on several occaisions. It was a hit as the food and service was awesome and the ambiance was great. It was a good choice.
April 3, 2014|A great time|5|This is my second time coming here and though the food was not up to par as the first, it was still enjoyable. Both me and my friend ordered their specials of the night (pan roasted fluke and grilled sirloin), both were of mediocre execution. My friend and I are of culinary background, and we both thought that it was under seasoned, even for a dining experience as such. But the vegetables that accompanied both of our dishes were divine. Appetizer wise, I would recommend the mussels and the calamari. Absolutely delicious and you can't go wrong with either one of them. I would definitely come here again, they have great service, something that I look for in a dining establishment such as this one.
March 30, 2014|Great brunch|5|First time, but would definitely go back. Service excellent.
March 29, 2014|There were 4 of us dining.|4|There were 4 of us dining. The special appetizer was delicious. There were plenty of wines on the wine list to choose from. Our server was very attentive. We were able to enjoy our dinner have dessert without feeling rushed.
March 28, 2014|Good restaurant with good|4|Good restaurant with good table service. The hostesses at the entrance could be a little more friendly and help older persons with their coats. It would not be too much effort on their part and that would be very helpful.
March 23, 2014|Not a good experience|2|I felt Extermly rushed because we were the last ones to be seated at 840 to the point that I didn't even feel comfortable eating the dessert there that I took it home I have been there several times in the past and loved it and have even recommended to friends and have bought gift certificates for friends but I was Extermly disappointed the food came out cold and like I said felt very rushed the whole staff was rushing around cleaning to get out of there and kept rushing us as well. I didn't want to complain because I hate doing that and I am in the resturant industry as well and didn't want to complain because I didn't want to seem like one of those people trying to get my bill comped. I really don't think I will be returning there again
March 22, 2014|Service was great but|3|The service was great...our waitress was very attentive!!! We ordered filet mignon medium...it came medium rare. The biggest disappointment was the noise level. We sat in the dining room overlooking the water. The noise in that room Saturday night was deafening. There was six people at one table that were truly obnoxious!!! Truly a disappointing night....
March 22, 2014|Always a treat.|5|My guests enjoyed an excellent dinner , as I had expected from many prior visits. Thanks again Waterman Grille!
March 19, 2014|Waterman Grille...our go to place|5|For outstanding value, try the prixe fixe served from Monday to Wednesday nite. You get a bottle of wine and 3 course great meal which specials may substitute in. Great views of the Seekonk River and outstanding service. This is our go to restaurant in the Wayland Square neighborhood.
March 15, 2014|It was my first time dining|4|It was my first time dining at warerman grille i was disapointed the bapr downstairs was closed for a private party we had to stand by the door beforebeing seated. My only complaint was the table they sat us at was upstairs in the middle of thefloor. It was uncomfortable having so much foot traffic going by us arll night long from both sides of the table.would not sit there again.other than that your restaurant is very nice. Thank you.
March 15, 2014|Come to Me, Creme Brulee!|5|For a classy and sophisticated Girls Night Out, we headed over to Waterman Grille for a group dinner. The intimate and cozy dining room overlooks the scenic Seekonk River. While debating what to order, I sipped on a perfectly muddled, refreshing Pomegranate Mojito. For dessert, Creme Brulee, come to me. I usually order this at other places and scrape every bit off the dish because there just isn't enough. Not at Waterman Grille. This was the LARGEST creme brulee I'd ever been served in a restaurant! I eagerly cracked that caramelized sugar top to get to the smooth, rich cream beneath it. Don't worry - I still scraped the plate because it was so darn good.
March 15, 2014|Great time!|5|This was my third experience at the Grille and I have enjoyed everytime. The atmosphere is cozy yet energetic, the staff has always been knowledgable and friendly and the food superb. I haven't had the opportunity yet to experience the Grille during the summer but imagine it's beautiful dining outside.
Dined on March 15, 2014|Great place!!|5|Waterman Grille is always wonderful! Great food-wonderful service--always the right place to go!!
March 15, 2014|How did I miss this?|4|4 years I've been visiting kids at Brown and I've never been here before. I have suffered through crazy long waits for brunch at the places on Broadway and they were noisy and rushed. Waterman Grille was neither. We had a reservation for lunch on a Saturday, but it wasn't crowded. The view of the river was peaceful, the space lovely, and my cheese plate and butternut squash bisque very good. Nice menu with both brunch and lunch items, a blood orange mimosa to start the conversation, and a happy daughter. Very satisfying.
March 9, 2014|We had a wonderful evening|5|We had a wonderful evening at Waterman Grille with our son, his girlfriend and her parents. All of the food was excellent and we had a great table by the window overlooking the Seekonk River The service was very good, and we look forward to returning again.
March 9, 2014|Lovely Brunch|4|We enjoyed a lovely Sunday brunch at Waterman Grill. It's a beautiful waterview setting with an extensive brunch menu including many gluten free alternatives. Service staff was attentive to gluten free needs. Our own waitresses was not as attentive as one would expect. Perhaps because we were upstairs, away from my dining area, but coffee was not refreshed, champagne not poured etc. Nice when you got her attention, but that was sometimes had to do.
March 8, 2014|Dinner|3|The rib appetizer and Caesar salad were wonderful. The Gruper special was not so great. Kind of bland.
March 8, 2014|Thank you !!|4|We are from Boston and a friend recommended that we try Waterman Grille for dinner prior to seeing Tony Bennett at the Providence Performing Arts Center. The entire staff was friendly, the service was great and the food was very good. I would recommend to friends and will return again. Cheers!
March 8, 2014|First time|4|It was my first time there with my girlfriend. Very nice place. Good food. Definitely we will come back.
March 7, 2014|Tremendous food, excellent service.|5|"I have been to Waterman Grille on numerous occasions now, and have used OpenTable to book most of my reservations. This most recent visit was no different. Made a reservation for 2 thru OpenTable for 8pm on a Friday night. We arrived promptly @ 8 and were told our table ""wasn't quite ready."" No problem. We waited no more than 5 minutes, only to be seated at a nice spacious table for 4 near the window. The trick here is that I had actually requested a window seat in the comments section when booking my reservation! I also noted that we were celebrating good news, which the hostess made sure to note as she sat us at our table. Truly a classy place with excellent staff and even better food. A++"
March 2, 2014|Waterman Grille|5|I have never had a bad meal or bad experience at this restaurant.
March 2, 2014|Great Place|4|"Had a very good ""first time"" at the restaurant , I will definatly be going back.. They have a great view. It will be great in the warmer weather.."
March 2, 2014|Brunch at Waterman Grille|5|Four of us had a very good brunch at the Waterman Grille. Everyone was pleased with the menu and their selection. It has become one of our favorite go to restaurants. A restaurant eh Newport Restaurant Group can be proud of.
March 1, 2014|Over-priced and very noisy!!!|3|First off - I would say the price point of this restaurant is $$$ - which would be the price per person of one meal, one drink and tip. The food was nothing special and for the prices I expected everyone's meal to be great!! We started out with the Artisan Cheese Plate ($13.95) which was very nice. The meals ordered were Short Ribs ($23.95), Georges Bank Scallops ($29.95) and the Filet Mignon ($33.95). The scallops had 5 medium scallops served on risotto. The risotto was a little under cooked and really no flavor at all with this plate. The Filet was tiny for the price and served on mashed potatoes. The short ribs were served over gnocchis. The desserts were $9 each and very limited. Would not return.....
March 1, 2014|You get what you pay for|5|Brunch at the Waterman Grille is not inexpensive, but the quality of the service, the food, and the location are right on par for the price.
February 26, 2014|great evening|5|I made a reservation for my husband and I for our anniversary. This was our first time here so I was hoping it would be nice given the occasion. When I made the online reservation (very convenient) I mentioned that it was our anniversary and requested a quiet table. When we got there we liked the romantic, cozy atmosphere, when we got to our table it was sprinkled with rose petals! Our server was very attentive and friendly and the food was Amazing! We did the three course deal for two which comes with a bottle of wine for $60, which was very reasonable for what you get. When Dessert came out we were surprised again with complimentary champagne! We both left full and happy, Waterman Grille really made our evening special!
February 22, 2014|Excellent all around|4|We chose the Waterman to celebrate my birthday and we were not disappointed. Service was top notch as was the food. They have a great menu and I will go back to explore some of their other signature dishes.. The crowd was lively and the atmosphere was fun.
February 20, 2014|Valentine's Makeup|4|Unfortunately missed out on Valentine's Day while traveling for work, so took the girlfriend here the following week. It's the second year in a row we've gone to the Waterman Grille and we plan on going for many more years to come.
February 19, 2014|Great food and service. Water|4|Great food and service. Water view outside dining.
February 18, 2014|A wonderful birthday dinner|5|A wonderful birthday dinner with delicious food and excellent service. A little noisy if you are looking for intimate conversation....
February 16, 2014|Excellent dinner all the way|5|Excellent dinner all the way around. We didnt have a bad meal between the 5 of us. Recommend reservations.
February 16, 2014|Will consider having salmon|3|Will consider having salmon grilled instead of the wood fire.Wood fire is dry and. crusty
February 16, 2014|Been there several time. Food|5|Been there several time. Food always excellent. Service also excellent.
February 15, 2014|Just ok|4|I had been here before for a function where we just had an appetizer spread but everything was good so tried it out for a Valentine's weekend dinner. I expected the good to be better but it was just fine. I had the French onion soup to start and it was very bland. My husband ordered the margherita pizza and it was also just ok. Our entrees also were good but did not knock our socks off. The place itself though is nice; we were seated upstairs in a very small but romantic dining room. Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive without being a pest. Overall, I'd say we would go again and try different dishes.
February 14, 2014|Elegant Restaurant|5|Amazing food and great customer service. Highly recommend.
February 14, 2014|Valentine's Day|4|"We had reservations here on Valentines Day. It was easy to find but parking was awful despite them having their own lot! Upon walking in, we couldn't even get inside because there were 3 couples standing in the ""waiting area"" for either a checked coat or table. This area is maybe 3 feet by 3 feet so get cozy to the stranger next to you! When we finally were seen/able to be addressed by the hostess, she was very pleasant. Our table was ready immediately and coats checked promptly. Once seated, we realized we had a wobbly table. Luckily our server fixed it when we informed her. She was attentive. He had the filet minon (was ""pretty good"") I had the chicken breast which was very good. For dessert I had Almond Joy which was amazing."
February 14, 2014|Valentine dinner|4|We usually do not eat out on busy holidays such as valentines day, however this year we did and we were not disappointed. We ordered light due due a theater commitment . The mediteranean plate had an array of delights such as grape leaves, humas, loves, peppers and breads. Yum! The butternut sqush bisque was amazing, the organic field of greens salad could have been larger.
February 13, 2014|Great meal|5|We had a gift card for the Newport Restaurant Group and decided to try the Waterman Grille. Very glad we did. For apps, we got onion soup & butternut bisque, meals were lamb shank & salmon & dessert was the almond joy-which we split! Service & meal were excellent-pricey, but worth it.
February 13, 2014|Romantic Find so close to home|5|"First visit to Waterman Grill and will not be my last. My father use to say, on the first bad visit, ""well we have been here twice, our first and last"". NOT so with Waterman Grill. Not the least expense place but really the best food, in all gentry. The service top notch and really value priced. First time a waiter asked for my jacket/rap coat tag to make sure it was ready when leaving. Nice touch. I will not go into detail on our food selection etc., for all were a 10 in my book no matter which menu selection is made. Highly recommended."
February 13, 2014|Lovely place|4|We had filet mignon- perfect- and shrimp with sweet potato ravioli - unfortunately oversalted. Excellent cosmo. Just right Caesar salad. Lovely dining area, terriffic and personable waiter (Brian). Exquisite dessert- flourless chocolat truffle cake and lemon vanilla cheesecake. Even the fresh decaf coffee was great. The maitre'd brought us house-made limoncello. Very nice. Wonderful setting on a cold, windy Valentine eve.
February 8, 2014|Consistent and reasonable...|3|Decent prices, decent quality, and ok portions. I have never cared for the seating upstairs which feels isolating and separate from the energetic vibe downstairs. The hassle free parking and river location are a plus.
February 7, 2014|Fantastic!|5|This was my third time at Waterman Grille and each time it is absolutely spectacular. A great menu is matched by fantastic, professional service at all levels from the bussers to the wait staff to the management. My house drink was superb with a great mix of rum bitters and Cointreau. The salad was delicious with one of the best Caesar dressings I've had. The main course for me was a filet with greens and potato. The filet was a little small in my opinion for the price, but it had wonderful flavor. My girlfriend's Waterman Steak was also delicious she said. We're looking forward to going back to explore more of the delicious menu.
February 2, 2014|Sunday Brunch|5|The food at Waterman Grille is delicious and it is one of the few restaurants that accepts reservations for brunch (regardless of party size). My friend and I enjoyed the Newport Benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached and the crab cakes outstanding. If you are looking for a great place for brunch, lunch, or dinner, I highly recommend Waterman Grille.
January 31, 2014|Expectations were high...|2|Overall, it was a sub-par experience...having said that, we would come back a second time. When we walked in, a steak was being sent back due to being undercooked...That should've been a sign. My steak was undercooked, charred from the grill & lacking any sort of seasoning, the sides were good however. The beer selection was better than expected & the food options were worth the trip to the east side. For the price, a little more attention to detail could have been included.
January 25, 2014|Awesome!|5|"I recently moved to RI and had friends coming to visit who have gluten free needs, I know nothing about anything so far in RI so I googled ""gluten free menu"" and lucky enough for them and I I found this place. The gluten free and regular menu is amazing. My gluten free friends LOVED the gluten free bread rolls which isn't an easy accomplishment. We (They also have gluten free beer which was approved too!) Had a great table with the view of the water and the ambience was lovely. From the hostess to our server to the manager everyone was supernruwas super sweet and friendly. Best night out I've had in a while."
January 25, 2014|Excellent food ambiance and service|4|The ever changing menu is always a great choice along with excellent attentive service. The duck was amazing, in fact everyone in our party faved about how perfect they found the meal. Even better in the summer but dark and cozy spot for dinner anytime.
January 25, 2014|Delicious dinner in a cozy setting|5|"The cozy atmosphere from the fireplace and brick walls combined with watching the snow swirling on the river was a perfect way to fight winter blues.Loved the ""Taste of the Mediterranean"" appetizer, salmon, lentil dinner, and the deserts were all tasty. My husband especially enjoyed the Almond Joy concoction. My favorite that will keep me coming back is the Waterman Doli, such a yummy pineapple drink without being sweet. Hostesses and wait staff were great. Loved the pace of the meal, not rushed but never felt like we were waiting. A great place for a lovely meal with friends."
January 25, 2014|Excellent for gluten allergies|5|My husband and I had such a fantastic experience on Saturday night. We've been to your restaurant a few times before and this was no disappointment. The staff was so on top of my gluten allergy. And the food was amazing. I even loved that I got gluten free bread in my own basket when my husband got the regular bread. Thank you for thinking of the little touches.
January 19, 2014|Great!|5|Everything was excellent on my birthday. Food, service, drinks, desert, cappuccino from start to finish.
January 18, 2014|Classy, Clean.|4|Me and my girlfriend were very impressed with how clean and classy the Waterman Grille was. The service and food was fantastic! Filet Mignon was just a bit overpriced in my honest opinion though.
January 17, 2014|Sweet spot!|5|Went on a date with my girlfriend on a Friday night. The scene was amazing and the food was delicious! Great service and an overall wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend this to my friends!
January 17, 2014|another enjoyable evening|5|We had great service, the food is prepared specifically for my dietary needs and it always tastes fantastic. The Waterman Grille bends over backward to please ... The view is very nice, something about being on the water, very relaxing ...
Dined on January 16, 2014|Our Go To Spot|5|Waterman Grille is our standard go to place. Food always exceeds expectations, service always good and nice atmosphere. A consistent and reliable stellar night out. Mushroom spring rolls, lobster Mac and cheese and hibiscus martinis are a few favorites. Meatloaf, salmon are also amazing. Bread is to die for. Go to Waterman Grille, you won't be disappointed.
January 15, 2014|Waterman grille is excellent|5|The Waterman Grille provides the perfect place to go for family celebrations, business dinners, or a romantic evening for two. It's a little more upscale, so you'd feel fine in a suit, but not so much so that if you come in jeans you'll feel unwelcome. Good wine selection and the food was delicious. For the foodies out there I guess I would describe it as American home food with gourmet accents making it the perfect restaurant for beginner foodies or groups with picky eaters. Set right on the water, if you can get a table on the first floor the scenery is beautiful. The wait staff has always been friendly (sometimes a tiny bit slow) and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
January 15, 2014|Fine food. Great Service|5|Went for Restaurant Week. Food and service were both top notch. Would return with no hesitation
January 14, 2014|Amazing Meal|5|The food was wonderful as well as my martini. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting. Can't wait to go back!
January 10, 2014|Delicious!|5|Everything was delicious! The staff was incredibly attentive and offered helpful recommendations. The creme brûlée was the best I have had and quite large.
January 8, 2014|Thanks- great service|5|We decided to sit at one of the tables in the bar this time. It was busy- and I'm very pleased to say the service was just excellent! The food is always great. I love the atmosphere- cozy with a buzz AND they know how to pour a proper cocktail. I most definitely appreciate the gluten free menu options as well as the vegetarian additions to the menu!!
January 5, 2014|The Grill will thrill you !|5|Well, anyway, the experience is worth a visit. Brunch both Saturday and Sunday- great family time was had by us last week- and we did not hhave to clean up after the guests left !
January 4, 2014|Great Meal|4|Have eaten here several times and the food and service is always really great. This time we ate upstairs with some groups who were rambunctious. Not quite as relaxed for the two of us, but love the restaurant.
December 31, 2013|NYE dinner|4|overall it was good...we came here last year for NYE and the food was better than this year. 2 people ordered the waterman steak and they both said it was a little tough. i had the lamb shank. the meat was good but the ragu had an overpowering wine taste that dominated the dish. the restaurant has GREAT prices on its wines and the 2 bottles we tried were tremendous. i would visit again.
December 31, 2013|Good New Year's eve dinner|5|Came hear for NY's eve. Even though it was NY's eve, the service was excellent and the food was very good. I was skeptical because a few years ago I came here and the experience was not good. But this time we had no complaints. Planning to go back for brunch.
December 29, 2013|Be Back Soon!|5|This experience was amazing, life changing, astonishing, I loved it. My date with my now Fiance was drop dead perfect. The service, food, drinks. all around 5 star! Everything was absolutely perfect! I will defiantly be back soon! Thank you so much. You truly made my Fiance's as well as my night a sparking memory that will be life long kept in our hearts!
December 20, 2013|Very Pleasant|5|Very pleasant from the moment we entered the door, greeting was lovely, table was by the water as requested. Our waitress was informative, friendly and super efficient. The food was divine and I am gluten,dairy and egg free and the chef did a wonderful job creating a special side for my meal. Overall a wonderful evening!
December 18, 2013|Generally Consistent|3|"You can't beat their specials. I often have a problem with their salmon. Even though I order cooked through it sometimes comes out too raw. Tonight there was a lot of ""black meat"" like swordfish has. The cook says it is just a blood line. You know what I say keep the blood line in the kitchen and throw it back into the ocean! Yuck! The waitress did offer to get me something else but I was in a hurry and could not wait."
December 9, 2013|Looking forward to going back|5|Loved the food and service. Great place that made me feel like I was out on an actual date with my life, and not just out getting some food.
December 8, 2013|Great Find!|4|This is a wonderful little place with lots of atmosphere and great food! There is a fireplace in the bar area, which makes it very cozy, and picture windows in the small deck-like dining room looking out on the river. The only downside is not the fault of the restaurant; there is a view of the river, but the opposite embankment is unfortunately quite ugly...rundown buildings, piles of trash and whatnot. I imagine, though, if you came at night, it would be much more pleasant (we were there for brunch), as there was soft lighting and candles at every table, and after dark the opposite shoreline would probably not be visible. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and our waitress was excellent! Very convenient parking too!
December 7, 2013|Great Place on Seekonk River|4|The Waterman Grille provide consistently good food and service in a riverfront setting. Nice for dinner or Sat and Sun brunch.
December 2, 2013|Outstanding Again|5|The Outstanding food and service has made the Waterman Grille one our favorite places to have a special and romantic evening.
December 1, 2013|Always a treat-|5|Brunch, lunch or dinner- always a treat at The Grille.
November 29, 2013|Gluten free gem!|5|Waiter was extremely knowledgeable about gluten free. I was asked if I had an allergy or just a diet preference. To my surprise, I was brought a warm large gluten free roll. The exterior was crusty and interior was soft, was very good! My dinner was salmon over black lentils, and green beans. Food presentation and taste was exquisite. The manager delivered my meal personally, and reiterated that it was indeed GF. Highly recommend! Will def return.
November 18, 2013|Excellent Date|4|My wife and I recently had dinner at the Waterman Grille in celebration of our 2nd anniversary. The environment was very comfortable and inviting. Our server was very nice and was at the top of her game. She provided us with the specials, answered our questions well and ensured that our table was maintained throughout dinner (clean, wine glasses filled, etc.) Our food was very good (salmon and steak), prepared exactly as we requested and a nice portion. The drinks were also good and we enjoyed a bottle of wine which was price reduced as part of the restaurants 3 course offer. To cap off our dinner, they offered us some champagne on the house as a congratulations on our anniversary. Our overall experience was very good, highly recommend!
November 18, 2013|Hidden Diamond|5|A small little restraint off the beaten path on the outskirts of providence. A small little restauraunt upstairs with a beautiful bar and view of the water, downstairs a large area perfect for a special celebration with accessory to the water. Ambiance is perfectly cozy, lit candles, romance and a special place to bring your special someone. Service was quick, staff was knowledgable of all the dishes and enthusiastic to be waiting on you. Food was hands down the best I've had as of yet in Providence. The duck breast was perfectly cooked, my boyfriend pork chop was succulent and their sides are unique from red chili stirfry to a twist on Boston's baked beans. We loved our experience and look forward to heading back on our next visit to RI.
November 17, 2013|Very good food, nice plating|4|Very good food, nice plating as well. But my wife thinks the food is a bit oily and a bit salty, though good. The view of the river is not as good as expected.
November 16, 2013|Salt overpowered the George's|4|Salt overpowered the George's Bank scallop special with butternut risotto. Scallops a little tough, too well-done. Lamb shank very tender and fell off the bone.
November 15, 2013|Food , Excellent Service|2|The atmosphere and service we received at Waterman's was outstanding. Our meals started off fantastic with salads and apps. Unfortunately, my entree were terrible. I ordered the pork tenderloin, one of my favs. The waitress asked how I would like it cooked and I decided on the chefs recommendation. Either that was a big mistake or the chef doesn't know how to prepare pork. The pork came out so dry I couldn't eat a piece of it alone without gagging or guzzling water. This place dropped the ball on what I consider to be the most important part of our experience and we won't be returning.
November 10, 2013|Wonderful time and a great,|4|Wonderful time and a great, great staff. The food was outstanding and the overall place was fantastic. Hope to be back very soon.
November 10, 2013|Our first visit to the Waterman|4|Our first visit to the Waterman Grille was pleasant. Convenient parking, spacious tables and a nice decor. The lunch/brunch menu was adequate, but not particularly unique. Unfortunately, the restaurant had run out of specials by the time we arrived at 1 p.m. The food was well prepared with generous portions. Serving staff was friendly.
November 8, 2013|not too happy.|3|Food was good, price was okay, service not as spected. Wont go there again.
November 8, 2013|Us 11/8|4|Thought the food was outstanding service was great could have been a little more attentive. Thought portions of the protein were to small. Would rather pay the price for a piece of meat and order the sides. Sides were huge. Will always return no complaints just opinion. go often enough. Did not feel that I paid too much just would have liked 1 more slice of filet for the money. The skate wS Wy too small and 4 scallops was not enough.
November 7, 2013|Loved it!|4|Great food, best fried calamari we've had ever! really interesting pairings and flavors. The service was exceptional, when was the last time server crumbed your table after every course? We really enjoyed the whole experience. The noise level was high though, lots of wood/glass so acoustics are not great. High Recommendation.
November 3, 2013|Perfectly delightful!|5|"We went here because they accept reservations for Sunday brunch. They have a variety of reasonably-priced menu options and are in a less congested area with river views. We were seated promptly and all staff were extremely pleasant and efficient. The gluten-intolerant diner in our party was accommodated with a 3-topping gluten-free pizza ($17) that he raved about and his wife loved the lobster mac & cheese ($21) that was a huge portion and not cloyingly rich. I had Newport eggs benny ($15) with crab cakes substituting the English muffin and a tomato/red onion aoli instead of hollandaise, and my husband had the ""regular"" eggs benny ($10). Our dishes were accompanied by home fries and fresh fruit, and were ample and very tasty."
November 2, 2013|Birthday dinner|5|I made a reservation here for my boyfriends birthday dinner. Everything about it was excellent. We had heard great things about the place and had been wanting to try it. I'm certainly glad we did- the food, the drinks, the service, the atmosphere- everything was fabulous! We will definitely be back.
November 1, 2013|Very Good But Not The Usual Excelle|4|I usually rate this excellent however, this time very good. A little disappointed in the portion size and price of my veal chop over allegedly 3 ounces of lobster. This was a special at $36 and there was no way there was 3 ounces of lobster. Even the veal chop didn't seem to get 10 ounces. While the food was delicious, it wasn't worth $36. Also, they delivered the wrong meal initially which caused another 10 minute delay in our meal.
October 26, 2013|Brunch|4|Nice to see that Waterman Grille now serves brunch on Saturday. Food was great, and service was very nice. Would recommend highly!
October 24, 2013|Great place|5|Server was wonderful had great recomendatons We started with sharing the mediterranian plate. some of the best humus we have ever had. Grape leaves fantastic and the pita bread with seasonings was the best We all had the evening's special of salmon cooked to perfection Desert was the chocolate bread pudding DECADENT!!
October 21, 2013|Lovely dinner @ Waterman Grille|5|I recently had dinner at Waterman Grille and the dinning experience was exceptional. The food and service combined with the ambience made for a lovely evening. I would highly recommend the Waterman Grille.
October 20, 2013|I tried the waterman steak|2|I tried the waterman steak and the duck mac and cheese. The steak was very dry (medium well) and the duck mac and cheese was nothing spectacular. I went for the preselected cabernet (red wine) with the steak. It wasn't the best pairing, and it didn't compliment the meal very well. The creme brulee had an inconsistent texture, but the taste was standard. The portions were very large, but for the price-- I would rather wait for restaurant week and go to the ruth chris steakhouse or gracie's. I was seated with my boyfriend in the upstairs area. The atmosphere was very romantic and we had a nice view of the river at sunset. However, the restaurant was slightly cold; there was quite a draft from the windows. Food quality wasn't worth the price.
October 20, 2013|Table by the window overlooking|4|Table by the window overlooking the water with good friends, professional service, and great food. It was a perfect fall morning and the brunch was delicious. We'll be back to try dinner soon.
October 20, 2013|Great for bruch|4|Great location on hill at edge of water. Excellent food and service. I look forward to returning for dinner and wine.
October 18, 2013|Effortless Dining Experience|5|We made reservations for dinner at the Waterman Grille to celebrate our 5th anniversary. The staff was generous and accommodating, seating us exactly as I requested. The food was absolutely delicious! Plus, I was able to substitute for one of the side dishes. Dessert was wonderful and the whole experience felt cozy and relaxed.
October 16, 2013|Quality and price|5|Excellent prix fixe menu ...great value ...great service...almost flawless!
Dined on October 15, 2013|Great food|4|Wonderful food, wonderful service. I had butternut bisque that was piping hot and delicious. I had the filet for dinner and it was a perfect medium rare and very tender. The mashed potatoes that it sat on were also fantastic. Only complaint is that it was quite loud in the dining room. Would be nice to go when the weather is nice so you could eat outside. Also, it would be nice if the water under the restaurant was lit up because as cars drove by on the other side of the river the headlights were blinding. If there was more light on the restaurant side, you probably would not notice the cars on the other side.
October 15, 2013|Came here for the 3 course|4|Came here for the 3 course meal deal and thought it was a great value! Had a great time.
October 13, 2013|Great Dining Experience!|5|We had a wonderful time at Waterman Grille. The food was exceptional!!
October 13, 2013|One of the better ones|4|The Waterman Grille is always good. Service is friendly, food is excellent, ambiance is great overlooking the river. We go here three of four times a year and always enjoy it.
October 12, 2013|Great food and care for allergies|4|My husband and I came here for our anniversary and found the food to be excellent. He has celiac disease, and we were very impressed with how seriously the staff took his need to avoid gluten. The gluten-free dining options were great, and he especially loved that he got a dinner roll with his meal - a rarity! We were surprised at the end of our meal with two glasses of (very good!) champagne in celebration of our special day. I really have no complaints at all, other than that our server was perhaps a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables she was serving - we did have to wait longer than I'd have liked for her to come back and bring on the next portion of our meal. but she was extremely friendly and really good at recommending items.
October 11, 2013|Birthday dinner|5|Booked for a birthday dinner Waterman Grille did not disappoint the food was terrific, the sever was great.
October 8, 2013|A gem of a place|5|Chose this restaurant on a whim and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. The food was great, the service was great, and the ambiance was great. The fixed price menu was a super deal and we did not feel like we missed anything by choosing this on the menu - and my wallet was smiling afterwards!
October 6, 2013|Everything was terrific! I|5|Everything was terrific! I love going to this restaurant! It is always consistant with the food and the staff is great, they know there stuff! Thanks.
October 5, 2013|When in Providence...|5|We actually very rarely get to spend any time in Providence, on our way to and from the Cape. But when we do, we put Waterman Grille on top of the list of things to do, and savor. From the cozy comfort of the building and dining areas, to the quality and deliciousness of the food, to the warmth and professionalism of the staff... they have the whole package. Our waiter Brian was the icing on the cake of a wonderful evening, making it absolutely perfect. Thank you to everyone at Waterman Grille.
October 5, 2013|A-Word-of-Mouth Find|5|Recommended by a waiter at another restaurant we like, Waterman Grill exceeded our expectations. Definitely a high energy place. While very busy, we found a seat at the bar, prompt service while we waited for our table. A fine wine list with good choices for By-the-Glass folks. Food was excellent and the waitress very accommodating and attentive. Right on the water (Seekonk River), we noticed there was outside dining opportunities, so guessing this place would really be hopping in the summer.
October 3, 2013|Wonderful Night|5|My husband and daughter took me for my birthday and everything was wonderful. The food was excellent and they even brought me a complimentary birthday dessert which was huge. We shared it and it was delicious. Everyone was very friendly. The best restaurant in the Newport Restaurant Group in my opinion.
October 2, 2013|Two recent visits both resulted|4|Two recent visits both resulted in very enjoyable and memorable experiences. Food was very good to excellent and waite service was impeccable on each visit. Both visits included outdoor seating which is highly recommended whenever weather permits although indoor seating is also very attractive. Most recent waiter, Joseph, was beyond excellent and should be commended. I can't wait to return. Thanks Waterman Grille.
September 30, 2013|Your Taste buds will thank you|5|Everything from the lobster roll to the braised beef with sweet potato gnocchi to the banana dessert w homemade toffee was absolutely amazing. Service was spectacular and view of water just added to the special nite.
September 29, 2013|Service with a smile|5|What a find! The service was fantastic, friendly wait staff. The menu offers an attractive array of food for food lovers. The prix fix menu is delightful at a very attractive price, with an option to add a bottle of wine for $5 when two or more order the prix fix menu.
September 28, 2013|Enjoyable first experience|4|Received a gift card as part of Newport Restaurant Group so thought we would give it a try based on other reviewers. I had requested a window seat and they granted our request. Great views of the River. All of our appetizers were great. French onion soup was outstanding. We thought menu was a little limited but some good choices. Dinner was very good as were the desserts. Noise level was a little loud, but not unbearable. Overall a very nice experience. Our waiter Louie was very personable and an excellent server.
September 24, 2013|I'm always pleased with my|4|I'm always pleased with my dining experience at the Waterman Grille!
September 22, 2013|Sunday Brunch|5|Wonderful brunch but with a few minor suggestions. I had the eggs benedict and the hollandaise sause seemed to be lacking lemon. My husband had amazing sweetpotatoe and apple pancakes. Our friends had frittaa and anothe dish that was initially served incorrectly he had requested scrambled eggs and was served poached. However it was immediatly corrected Wish I could remember our servers name he was fantastic.
September 21, 2013|Anniversary|5|We had a wonderful dinner here last weekend. I wanted a romantic, waterfront spot and this was phenomenal! Service and food were great and the surprise champagne toast at the end of the night was fantastic. Staff made it a memorable night for us. Can't wait to go back. Bet it's just as great to sit outside for lunch.
September 20, 2013|The food, service and atmosphere|4|The food, service and atmosphere were great. We'll definitely be back.
September 20, 2013|One of the best|5|We have been to this gem a number of times and each time we go it is better than the previous visit. We plan on having our wedding and reception there. Save the May date!!!
September 19, 2013|30th birthday success!|5|We came to this restaurant for my husband's 30th birthday, and apparently several other people chose to do the same. The restaurant was bustling for a Thursday evening in September, but began to clear out around 8:30pm. They get most of their ingredients from local farmers and seafood places, and their food tastes very fresh. My husband had the lamb shank with the special risotto of the evening- garlic parmesan (I highly recommend!). I had the Altantic Salmon special with butternut squash, and a potato medley hash. The presentation of each dish was impeccable and our server was delightful, coming just frequently enough to make sure we wanted for nothing, but was not overbearing. I highly recommend this as a romantic evening out!
September 14, 2013|Exceptional Nite at Waterman Grille|5|We went for my honey's birthday. The service was excellent and we really enjoyed the dining on the deck along the Seekonk River. Our server was very polite, friendly and really attentive we really appreciated her! The FOOD was EXCELLENT and we will be back. We started off with a Caesar Salad and Cornmeal Crusted Oysters. For entrees we had Bacon Blue Cheese Buttered Filet Mignon with Swiss Chard and Mashed Yukon Golds and Roasted Lamb Shank with Feta Twice Baked Potato and Swiss Chard. I am not a lamb eater and I had to taste it...tender beyond belief and so robust with the flavors! My filet was excellent and cooked to perfection. We both finished off with a lovely Creme Brouille! Definitely going back!
September 14, 2013|Good but a little disappointing|4|My husband and I have been to the Waterman Grille many times and decided to join some friends for dinner on Saturday. The ambiance is charming and warm and the service was excellent. I ordered the Statler chicken (which I've had before) but was disappointed with the flavor and texture of the meat. However, the Wateman salad as a starter was great. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin which was slightly overcooked, although the accompanying bean ragout was delicious. The restaurant was very busy that night, so it was a bit noisy.
September 14, 2013|A dependable restaurant|4|We frequent the Waterman Grille often. Great and easy parking, nice ambiance, good food and usually good service. It was a very busy Saturday evening and the restaurant was very loud which made it difficult to visit. Our server, Raina, was the hardest working server we had ever seen and took care of us and all her customers with a smile. Our food was excellent. I had the Salmon on a bed of lentils and the others had the special Shrimp dish. We all raved about it.
September 14, 2013|Wonderful meal in a wonderful|5|Wonderful meal in a wonderful setting. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and we will return again. Everything we ate was perfectly prepared and very tasty.
September 10, 2013|Good food in a lovely place|5|Safely poised 20 ft above the Seekonk river in Providence on the site of an old bridge you can dine outstandingly on fish or meat. There is a very acceptably priced set menu, a wide range of a la carte items and a good wine list. Definitely worth a visit.
September 9, 2013|I always enjoy dining at Waterman's|5|I always enjoy dining at Waterman's Grille and recently brough an out of state client there. Everyone at our tabel raved about their individual dishes. The price fixed menu Sun thru Wednesday is reasonable and definitely a draw. It works because it gets me and husband to go out early in the week.
September 7, 2013|Mixed Expereience|3|Great location with a nice deck overlooking the water. Entrees, however, were disappointing. Flavor mix in the lobster grilled cheese didn't work for me and a dinner companion found his lobster mac and cheese bland. Service was very good.
September 6, 2013|Delicious!|4|Food was great, service was great! We sat inside because it was a bit chilly, but the outdoor deck looked absolutely beautiful! Right on the water! Will definitely go back.
September 4, 2013|Always Good and Consistant|5|Doesn't get any better than this neighborhood gem.
September 1, 2013|Our anniversary|4|We really appreciated the service from our waiter, and staff. Specifically the waiter was very nice, I wish I recalled his name. we had our baby with us, as the babysitter cancelled last minute, and we really appreicate that we had such a special time, and able to take our time at the grille. thank You Even the restuarant manager came by everyones table to ask how our meals were. we will be coming back
September 1, 2013|Outstanding!|5|Great food, service and atmosphere! We're looking forward to our next trip to providence so we can eat there again. Absolutely a find for foodies. The duck was excellent - prepared as the chef recommended - don't miss the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
August 31, 2013|Amazing food and service -|5|Amazing food and service - definitely a Providence gem.
August 30, 2013|Waterman Grill|4|We had a great table by the window and enjoyed the view. The food is always good and it is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy dinner.
August 30, 2013|Superb service|5|We celebrated our 43 wedding anniversary there on Friday night (August 30, 2013)....Everything was wonderful, but the service is absolutely outstanding....I think that there were at least three people who were attending us....We were well cared for, but they were very careful not to interupt. Fabulous
August 25, 2013|Spotty|3|I have had several enjoyable meals at this restaurant; however, the service was not very good this evening. The mussels were also cool when they were served. The rest of the meal, as always, was delicious. I do love this place -- it would just be better if they trained their wait staff. We waited 10 minutes for a water and then another 10 for her to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. After leaving a very nice tip, she never even thanked us, which while that isn't necessary, it s always nice to be told to have a nice evening and to be thanked. We were invisible once we paid the check.
August 25, 2013|Waterview Excellence|4|Consistently outstanding restaurant on Seekonk River.
August 25, 2013|Sophisticated neighborhood dining|5|"We hadn't been to WG in years. What a wonderful reintroduction! Everything was exceptional: food, service, deck dining, topped off be ""take your time"" attitude. We can't wait to return!"
August 24, 2013|The main courses that we ordered|4|The main courses that we ordered were good. The squash blossom appetizers were tasteless. The waitress was a sweet heart.
August 24, 2013|Dinner for 4|4|Great choices, the price was very reasonable for the food. Drinks were lovely. the server was a bit over wordy and too much upselling but over all a very nice time; defiantly will return
Dined on August 23, 2013|Love the gluten free & veg options|4|Waterman Grille has always been known for great seafood and outstanding American fare. I am so HAPPY that they have made some excellent upgrades to the menu for those of us who are vegetarian and our gluten free friends. BRAVO!
August 22, 2013|Always enjoyable...|5|I found waterman grille when looking for a place w outstanding atmosphere and great food for my sons wedding rehearsal dinner. Visiting three times prior to booking ,We were very impressed and wonderfully satisfied. We continue to return and have thoroughly enjoyed sitting at bar, dining room bar table and upstairs for family dinner. The rehearsal dinner was amazing. Service and food difficult to beat... I love waterman Grille!! The rewards program is a bonus and gift cards always bring a smile.
August 21, 2013|Great evening with a water view|4|We were looking for good food near home on the water. Very happy with our choice. All of the food was delicious and the service was really awesome! We ate outside on their patio (it is first come first serve outside seating so book reservation early if dining on patio is what you are interested in) with a nice view of the full moon and water where we watched Brown University crew and other boats quietly pass by. The food was all fresh and interesting apps and entrees. We would love to dine there again soon. We weren't aware when we booked our reservation and found out at the end of the meal that the owners also own a bunch of Newport restaurants that are all great like the Mooring, Castle Hill, etc You won't be disappointed!
August 18, 2013|What a gem!|5|Drive may be a bit, but you will be so pleased. Service excellent and the waterman steak was as good as it gets. Try the combo specials (3) items grouped. Will make a point to go back. Wonderful river views and great outdoor patio.
August 17, 2013|Great food and view|5|We always come to Waterman when we want a great meal outside. The view is very nice, adds a lot to the experience. We had the oyster in corn meal app and it was very good. The batter was light and very tasty. We also had the smoked gouda and shrimp chowder, was very tasty. For entree we had the special, a black bass over swiss chard and a potato and chourico stir fry with a sweet broth. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the broth was good.
August 17, 2013|We had a great meal, the service|5|We had a great meal, the service was fantastic and the view was spectacular.
August 16, 2013|Always a pleasure|5|I can always count on the Waterman Grille to have wonderful service and food. It is a top choice of mine to meet friends and family for dinner.
August 10, 2013|Truly Enjoyable Dinner|5|"Waterman Grille is a gem. It may be a little ""off the beaten track"" (in a city that has so many great restaurants that are right downtown and ""on the beaten track"") but it's definitely worth the drive. It's only takes about 8-10 minutes from downtown and, hey, that's pretty much the same as driving 5 blocks crosstown in New York, so it's no big deal. Once you get there, you'll be rewarded with a beautiful restaurant, charming location and views, excellent food, and great service."
August 9, 2013|Enjoyable evening....nice ambience|5|My girlfriend and I enjoyed our night out at the Waterman. Staff was awesome and the food was great and good value. We reserved our seat and were so happy with our table view. Too bad we weren't there Sunday-Thursday to get the 3 course meal and bottle of wine...that looked like a great deal at $60.00. It was an awesome night, we would definitely go back.
August 4, 2013|Excellent dining experience|5|Made a family brunch a special ocasssion! Delicious food and great waitstaff.
August 4, 2013|Perfect summer brunch!|4|This was the perfect spot for a special summer morning brunch! We were lucky enough to have the perfect summer day to take advantage of the deck overlooking the Seekonk River. We enjoyed our food, the lobster croissant was filled with chunks of lobster and the Breakfast Burrito was tasty. We did feel our server could have been more attentive.
August 3, 2013|On the deck|4|Dining outside on the covered terrace deck was wonderful even with a little rain falling. Our meal was excellent and the service was good as well. It was only our second visit to Waterman's, but it even exceeded our previous experience. Would recommend dining here either at a window seat or outside to anyone. Nothing we have ordered from the menu has disappointed us and that is all we can ask of a restaurant.
August 2, 2013|Urban Romantic|4|Elegantly casual, the perfect Friday night wind-down spot, with crisp, friendly service starting at the front working through the entire evening. Do specify you want outdoors if the weather is good and you'll see a side of Providence few do, urban/industrial funk reclaimed by nature. Bar downstairs looks to be the perfect spot to weather a winter storm.
August 1, 2013|First time visit - Great!|5|What a great find! My husband and I dined at the Waterman Grille for my birthday. We left with our bellies full of delicious food. I can tell you I will look forward to going back soon. We had Cornmeal Crusted Oysters, Duck Duo and Waterman Steak. Creme Brulee and Chocolate Bread pudding for dessert. All plate licking good. The service was exceptional and loved sitting outside on the deck. I would recommend to definitely give place a try.
July 30, 2013|perfect all around|5|The service was wonderful, and the food was perfect. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Providence. Service tonight was exceptionally good.
July 28, 2013|All Pleased with dinner...|4|My picky eater family was satisfied and very pleased. Nice variety of food for all and the setting is delightful. Staff was helpful and attentive.
July 28, 2013|Excellent experience|5|My husband, parents and I had brunch here this past weekend. The service was excellent, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great! It was our first time and we came on the recommendation of the Phantom Gourmet. I will definitely be coming back to Waterman Grille!
July 27, 2013|a real gem|5|the food here is always good, a little different with twists on common food that makes it delicious and interesting, and always a pleasant staff and good views, and a lovely dining experience. We have to travel a distance to get here, but it is worth while and there is free parking which makes it easy. Wish it were in our neighborhood.
July 25, 2013|initial impression not great|4|Arrived right at reservation time. We are from kook out of town and picked this place based on ratings but more importantly because it was on the water. While being seated we asked if we could have the table on the window overlooking the water. We we just told no and the only reason given was they had to be fair to the wait staff and it was this waitresses turn. Really? I don't care about that. The food and service were ultimately very good and we enjoyed the dining but the initial impression was hrrible. Get a new hostess or policy.
July 25, 2013|Great evening!|4|We dined at a table for 4 and sat by the window watching kayakers go by! We would have loved to dine outdoors, but it was raining. We have eaten outdoors at this restaurant in the past and enjoyed it very much.
July 24, 2013|Always awesome|5|Waterman Grille is the place that you can always count on for delicious food and excellent service.
July 22, 2013|Great dinner overall. Food|5|Great dinner overall. Food was delicious from start to finish. Waitstaff was attentive and did not rush us.
July 22, 2013|on the river|4|great spot directly on the river. nice place to dine out along good food
July 21, 2013|Brunch favorite.|5|Our favorite spot on the river for Saturday Brunch!
July 20, 2013|Great find in Providence|4|We are in Providence on a regular basis and were looking for a new experience. Had 9:00 reservations for myself, my wife and two daughters and the table was ready right on time. We did eat inside, but the outside dining also look very nice. The service was very good and the food was wonderful. We shared appetizers and enjoyed them all. My daughter and I both had the Duck Duo and it was one of the best dinners we have had in a long time. The other dinners which included the short ribs and salmon were all enjoyed. We will definitley keep the Waterman on our list when we return to Providence.
July 20, 2013|Wonderful|5|The service, the food and the view on the deck was all that I could ask for. Certainly will re-visit Waterman Grille in the future.
July 20, 2013|Food, glorious food!|4|Amazing filet mignon, fantastic wine and martinis, and great desserts! Wonderful gluten-free menu, too! Saturday night at 6 PM can get really loud, so you may want to dine on the deck if the weather permits. I was pleasantly surprised to see some people in shorts and sandals, some sundresses, and even a little one at the restaurant. The restaurant appeals to different crowds, and the meals range from average price to pretty fancy. There's something for everyone!
July 20, 2013|Great Spot|4|Our party of 4 had a fantastic meal here onSaturday night. The bar service was a little slow, but the pomegranate monitor was fabulous. For an app we had an excellent charcuterie plate for the table and the salads were fantastic. Many of the dishes featured locally grown and/or raised ingredients, making it a great experience.desserts were also a little on the slow side coming out, but they were delicious. Almost too hot would be my only complaint. If you are looking for a nice evening by the water,I would highly recommend this restaurant. A great place to sit and linger-service is a little slow, so make us Re you have the time. You won't regret being here!
July 19, 2013|One of our favorite restaurants|5|One of our favorite restaurants in Providence and we always take advantage of Restaurant Week by coming here-duck confit macaroni and cheese was out of this world!! The food is always fantastic, lovely view of the Seekonk River and friendly and attentive service.
July 19, 2013|we visited during Restaurant|4|we visited during Restaurant Week and the restaurant filled up quickly- a little too quickly I think for the staff to handle. Our food was delicious (calamari, steak, swordfish, swiss chard, lobster macaroni and cheese (?!) Our server was friendly and efficient, but the bar was backed up and one of our glasses of wine didn't arrive until one of the guests had almost finished his meal. That said, a manager or owner (not a waiter) was running food out from the kitchen and checking in with tables to make sure everything was ok. Also, our waitress invited one of our party to sample a wine selection before ordering to make sure it was to his liking. Side note- The wood-backed menus were a bit awkward. you could also skip the creme brûlée
July 18, 2013|Never Dissapointed|5|Been there a few times now and the food is always outstanding, service is great and the spot is very surprising! Great views and perfect outdoor seating as well.
July 15, 2013|Wonderful as always|4|Kevin, our server, was excellent. Attentive and friendly. He kept an eye on us throughout our meal and when we were ready for another drink he was right there. Really great server.
July 14, 2013|DINING AT ITS BEST|5|We chose Waterman Grille as our restaurant of choice for Restaurant Week because the menu looked impressive. The appetizers were unique and the entree selection included seafood and meat. So there was something for everyone in our party. We were not disappointed. The food was excellent and the service was great. And the final dessert course made our night complete. We would highly recommend this restaurant to our friends.
July 13, 2013|Unfortunate experience|2|Went here for a birthday dinner celebration. Our server was fair. Couldn't explain an entrée to me and didn't keep an eye on our drinks. Our second round of cocktails didn't arrive until halfway through our dinners. My meal went back twice for being undercooked; I others at the table were finished before my entree arrived back. Our guests' steak also went back for being undercooked as did the table of diners behind us. Desserts were good. This was my second and final visit. Would not recommend.
July 12, 2013|Awesome!|5|We had dinner upstairs - much quieter than near the bar. Chose from the restaurant week menu. Lobster salad app, hanger steak and key lime creme brulee - all perfect! Service was spot on. Great restaurant. Can't wait to go back!
July 12, 2013|Over rated|2|"My girlfriend and i went as part of restaraunt week. I consider myself a foody and work in the business. Let me tell you, what ever chef thought of taking a half deccent piece of swordfish and serving it with blackened innedible skin still on it and swimming in a pool of what tasted like ""Spagetti-O"" sauce should rethink their life choices. If this dish is any representation of the qualty of food and flqvors you get for the high prices you pay her, i would never reccomend this to a friend, or even an enemy."
July 12, 2013|A great meal where were could|4|A great meal where were could relax, enjoy the scenery and the ambiance and not feel rushed. The key lime creme brule was amazing!

Dined on July 7, 2013|Outside the city craziness|5|Celebrated our wedding anniversary on the deck. So peaceful, an occasional boat would go by. Our server, Samantha was very knowledgeable about the menu. We got a bottle of italian pino Grigio, which she kept inside for us since it was so warm out. Bread came out HOT--delicious! We got the oysters breaded in cornmeal and used the sauce to dip our bread in. My husband got the duck duo--cooked perfectly in a curry sauce. I got the lamb shank which had so much meat on the bone; . We shared both because they were too good not to! We were quite stuffed but could not resist dessert. We got the Cookie Monster--chocolate chip cookies with chocolate ice cream in the middle and a carmalized banana. We can not wait to see what's on the menu next time!
July 7, 2013|Food and service was good.|4|Food and service was good. Fine view. Would recommend to others.
July 6, 2013|Great Meal & Experience as Always|4|Our server, Andrea was excellent. She had a great attitude and energy despite it being a hot, humid, and muggy night. Our food was great, as usual. Will be going back again for sure.
July 6, 2013|Another great brunch !|5|Same as always; same as expected; always a delight for brunch by the river !
July 5, 2013|A New Favorite|5|ENjoyed a wonderful meal at Waterman Grill. A tad too hot for us to dine on the porch outside but you have a riverview from every seat in the dining room. We started with the calamari which was very tender and lightly battered. It was a large plate even for sharing. I ordered the Waterman Steak which was a 10oz top sirloin served over wilted spinach and lyonnaise potatoes with caramelized onions and smoked tomato aioli. It was excellent. The steak was nicely charred on the outside but cooked medium rare as I requested. My wife had the Duck Duo which was pan roasted duck breast with duck confit, stir fry vegetables and lemongrass white rice in a red curry sauce. Service was efficient and attentive.
July 3, 2013|A Summer Treat|4|Our deck table overlooking the river was spectacular even more rewarding was that the food matched the ambience. Service was friendly and efficient. My only other time at the Waterman Grille was during a snow storm. It was warm and cozy that night. It seems like a place for all seasons. We'll be back soon.
July 2, 2013|Consistently delivers!|5|We've been coming to this place for year, even when it was still Gatehouse. The service, the ambiance and the food are consistently top notch. It's a real gem for the East Side. A favorite!
June 30, 2013|Follow that hunch -|5|Follow that hunch and try the brunch- you will be glad you did !
June 29, 2013|yum|5|Had the lobster Mac n cheese, best I have ever had. Creme brule was also great. Indoor and outdoor dining on the water. Great staff, never wanted for anything.
June 29, 2013|Brunch|5|Altho brunch on Saturday is our usual,, we had the chance to do a second visit on Sunday- just as nice and our guest enjoyed his food immensely.
June 26, 2013|Price fixe menu is a winner|5|The price fixe menu is always a winner. I almost always get the salmon! The duck Mac and cheese is incredibly rich, delicious, and filling. The sorbets are always light and fresh (and magically erase calories... In my mind!) the wild mushroom bruschetta is earthy and brilliant. My husband and I come here for many of our special occasion dinners. Thank you for making fine dining very affordable in providence!
June 25, 2013|A really lovely evening|5|We had a wonderful evening at Waterman Grille! The fixed price menu during the week is a great deal and offers a really nice variety of choices. Our server, Dillon, did a great job of making us feel welcome without intruding on our night out. The views from the deck overlooking the river are absolutely the best in town. A great night.
June 25, 2013|Great food, great service,|5|Great food, great service, great managers - always consistent!
June 24, 2013|Delish!|5|Loved everything... From the atmosphere to our server to the food. It was pur Anniversary and we loved everything. I would highly suggest eating here!
June 24, 2013|The ability to dine al fresco|2|The ability to dine al fresco is one of the redeeming features of your restaurant. Though the hostess staff & our neophyte waiter were very friendly, my party of four were very disappointed in the lack of knowledge that he had about the menu & the mistakes however slight that he made. Due to miscalculations we accidentally gave him a tip that was so generous I fear it may have given him a false sense that he was a good server. He needs to WRITE things down so as not to mix things up. My menu choices (Mediterranean platter, salad with gorgonzola, & special Shartner farm /Four Town farm dessert) though seemingly inspired were not particularly so. I have attended various events in your downstairs venue. Thank you!
June 21, 2013|Ehh.....|3|Food was fair - Cheese plate average (no idea what cheese selection we were given); Ceasar Salad average; Duck Special was good; Scallop Special was bland and risotto flavorless. The A/C was blasting on us no matter what table they put us. If not for our wonderful server, it would have been a terrible experience!!! Wouldn't go back and won't recommend........
June 18, 2013|Turn the AC down!|2|The AC was blasting right on our table on a 60 degree day, it even blew the candle out on our table. It was so cold that my food and coffee were cold long before I finished. While the meal was tasty, the portions were skimpy and My wife and I actually ended up eating leftovers at home from the night before.
June 16, 2013|The price fixe menu is a great|5|The price fixe menu is a great deal. Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was excellent. Highly recommend!
June 16, 2013|Most enjoyable brunch.|5|We sat outside by the river. The water flowing by and the dappled sunlight created thoroughly peaceful atmosphere. The tables are spread far enough apart to allow for some relative privacy. The server was friendly and attentive. The highlight was the creative and delicious food.
June 15, 2013|Brunch spot|5|Great for Saturday or Sunday brunch overlooking the river. Excellent Crab Benedict.
June 11, 2013|Great Restaurant!|5|This restaurant is a great place to go with a crowd. Always fun!!!
June 9, 2013|Goodbye friends|5|Enjoyed introducing friends to a new restaurant for them, though they are moving away this week.
June 9, 2013|Wonderful Waterman|5|As usual, our brunch was excellent. My special request Eggs Benedict ( eggs on sliced turkey and avocado- skip the muffin and Canadian bacon) hit the spot and was done as I had wished. It was a lovely day but still comfortable inside, though many were on the deck enjoying the river scene. People were busy eating, talking and relaxing- no body was heard complaining, nor should they have been. Beautiful morning and brunch: nice combination to start Sunday. This is our preferred routine for the weekend.
June 8, 2013|outfordinner|4|This was my first time at Waterman Grille. The service was excellent, our waitress was impeccable given a busy sat night. Food was great, but not superb. My baked potato was ice cold, sent back and received one hot within minutes. The noise was horrible, hard to have a conversation again a busy night. This is a nice restaurant, however i would probably not return. I think you can get more for your money at others on the hill. But I am glad I tried it.
June 6, 2013|Had dinner with an out-of-state|5|Had dinner with an out-of-state friend, to catch up on years while enjoying some 'local flavor' and atmosphere. Service was wonderfully accommodating as we sat for hours. Both our meals were delicious- the grilled shrimp and lamb. The unusual combinations of accompanying fresh vegetables, herbs, risotto etc., make the overall flavors unique and wonderful. Have been there a number of times over the past several months, and never disappointed.
June 1, 2013|Great food/selection!|4|Waterman Grille has a great selection of apps/sharing plates/main courses. Everything we (and others) had lookeded delicious. I had the short ribs and they were flavorful and tender. My wife had the scallops and loved them. Pom mojito was excellent.
May 31, 2013|Summer night out|4|Perfect ambience for a date night or girls night out. The food is amazing and the view is lovely!
May 29, 2013|good, thoughtful, creative food|4|I go here often and I'm never disappointed. If you get a chance to sit on the deck, then the view of the river makes it an even better and beautiful experience. The food is always good, the service is friendly, attentive, although sometimes amateurish, and the price is right for what you get—good, thoughtful, creative, well-prepared food. For someone who lives close by, this is a go-to place for a great meal with friends. For those traveling from out of town, it's a nice destination.
May 28, 2013|Anniversary Dinner|5|We had a great time! They really made our anniversary dinner very special. Thank you Waterman Grille!
May 26, 2013|Great Sunday brunch spot|4|Enjoyed a lovely brunch with prompt and friendly service. The food was excellent and presented very well. Will definitely return.
May 25, 2013|It has improved with age|4|I've always wanted to love Waterman Grille, and I have never been able to do so, until now. The service is attentive without hovering, the menu is creative enough without being ridiculous, the preparation of the food perfect. My only complaint is that the restaurant is almost unbearably noisy - almost, but not quite. I will stand the noise again to enjoy the beautiful salads, steaks, fish, etc. that Waterman Grille offers.
May 25, 2013|Good food but too noisy|4|Met some out of town friends for brunch on Saturday. Food was fine but the noise level is too loud. We had trouble hearing each other across the table. Nice ambience other than that.
May 25, 2013|Still a favorite|4|This time it was for a Saturday brunch, and even though on a graduation weekend, not crowded. As always, the service was excellent, the food creative and both well-prepared and presented. Waterman Bloody Mary especially tasty. Nice to go when it was a bit less frenetic than the evenings and the prices are lower!
May 21, 2013|Hidden Gem|5|The Waterman Grille is a hidden gem in Providence. The staff is outstanding and the food is very consistent. A must-try!
May 20, 2013|Good local restaurant|4|Great food, great view, great Martini's, great parking. What's not to like.
May 19, 2013|Pleasant Surprise|5|The service was the best I have had in a long time. Pleasant, helpful, considerate, funny and attentive. The food was very good with a number of unusual choices on the menu. We are planning to go back soon.
May 19, 2013|Not as good as it usually|3|Not as good as it usually is. Appetizers were great. Dinner was okay.
May 15, 2013|Great Place|5|We vreally enjoy appitizers at the bar and dining in the dining area-Excellent!
May 15, 2013|Great time|5|The Grille has the best service and atmosphere! The food is always consistence and delicious, Great time had by all!
May 12, 2013|Lovely Mother's Day Brunch|4|Lovely Mother's Day Brunch 5/12/13. Accommodating staff. Glorious venue on upper enclosed porch with water view. Tasty menu - and outstanding variety of dishes. Please note that the mimosas are NOT included in the brunch pricing. Also, the restaurant added an automatic 18% gratuity - we were a party of two. I thought that 18% was generous - as this was a brunch buffet and we had to serve ourselves.
Dined on May 12, 2013|Mother's Day|5|The Brunch at the Waterman Grille was fantastic!!!!!!! They put on such a big display of all kinds of food and it was terrific. My daughters and I are making it a new tradition. Thank you to all the staff and managers you guys rock!!!!!!
May 11, 2013|The restuarant has a great|4|The restuarant has a great mix of upscale menu items and comfort food. For that reason it's a good fit if you have a mixed crowd. The food, for the most part, has been excellent. The only issue I had was during my last visit; I ordered the mushroom spring rolls, and the truffle oil had gone bad. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the cocktail list is impressive; tweaking standards and creating their own.
May 11, 2013|The food was delicious. I|5|The food was delicious. I had the fish special and it was specular. We had a person in our party that has many food allergies and it was handled in a lovely manner. Nothing was too much for the kitchen. We will definitely return.
May 11, 2013|Pleasant overall. Well worth it.|5|The prices are reasonable and the water view is nice. It's a little small but that doesn't take away from the experience.
May 10, 2013|Nice place for outdoor dining|4|I went here with a friend and we sat outside. We enjoyed watching the crew teams and the swans. It was a nice backdrop to enjoy our beer and appetizers. We were too full after appetizers to eat salads or entrees, but the food from other tables that passed by looked great. We are in our early thirties and were by far the youngest people eating dinner there at 7:30 on a Friday night, but other than that, the food and service made for a great meal.
May 8, 2013|Wednesday at The Waterman|5|The second time we've been and just as good as I remembered. We had a lovely table by the window overlooking the water, cocktails, wine, dinner and dessert were all excellent, as was the service. The only discomfort was the air condiitoning was blowing on our table.
April 27, 2013|Resaurant was far to noisy|3|Resaurant was far to noisy for dining.....felt more like a bar or tavern atmosphere; which made anything more than a burger inappropriate and overpriced.

April 14, 2013|Wonderful small restaurant|4|Wonderful small restaurant along the Seekonk river. Too chilly to be outside but I expect that makes the experience even better. Bloody Mary's were outstanding...and we are very particular about BMs...and the food was very good. My wife had the lobster/squash grilled cheese, one daughter had the frittata (very tasty but quite small), her twin had the Italian which she said was great, and I had the Newport Benedict which actually suffered from a lack of flavor in the green chile-tomato-red onion aïoli. Rather hard to imagine but it did. I would definitely go back if I lived in or return to the area but Atlanta is a little far away.

April 13, 2013|Enjoyed a nice dinner with|5|Enjoyed a nice dinner with good friends prior to PPAC. My wife had the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Very large portion, so I got a taste, and it was great. Other dishes were equally good including the scallops, grilled shrimp and Waterman steak. Great dinner!
April 7, 2013|This is the third time we|4|This is the third time we have visited within the past month. Each time was as good as the last. This was our first brunch at Waterman Grille and we were overwhelmed by the Duck confit omlette to which we added havarti and roasted mushrooms for a never before seen masterpiece. Our friends enjoyed the salmon cakes with poached egg and holandaise. It won't be long before we return, maybe next time for lunch.
April 6, 2013|The best food I have ever|5|The best food I have ever tasted a+++++ in my book
April 6, 2013|Food was good. Service a little|3|Food was good. Service a little slow. Entrees very good. The table next to us was very close to our table. Family of four with two boys about seven or eight who were very loud sitting there. Parents repeatedly told them to keep their voices down but it was like sitting in a McDonalds. I know this is one of those things that happen,but i wished the father spent a little more time teaching these kids manners than loudly telling them the complete story of Apollo 13. As far as deserts my wife had the chocolate whatever--she really liked it. I had the banana cake-which had about a tablespoonful of ice cream on it and was mediocre.
April 6, 2013|felt rushed half done with|3|felt rushed half done with dinner before wine was served despite two requests waitress seemed a little overextended and additionally busy with a trainee presentation was nicely done risotto served with the scallop special was bland but the scallops were excellent i wouldn't recommend to a friend but i would try again myself wondering if there is a quieter spot in the restaurant more distant from the bar
April 1, 2013|We really enjoyed our experience|5|We really enjoyed our experience at the Waterman Grille. We had the chefs 3 course menu and the food was fantastic. Add the bottle of wine and its still a great deal. We also enjoyed some cocktails. They were very well made and super tasty. Our server, Prana, was excellent. She was friendly, knowledgable and attentive. She informed us of the rewards program. Which is great since we will be having dinner at one of their restaurants on an upcoming trip to Newport. We would go back anytime.
March 31, 2013|There for Easter brunch.|4|There for Easter brunch. Food was great. Especially enjoyed the candy bar
March 30, 2013|Consistently Superb|5|The quality of everything here is superb, from the greeting at the door, to the bartender, to the attentive service of the waitstaff. This place never disappoints!
March 30, 2013|Yummy|4|Food was superb. We sat by the window and watched the sun go down over the water. Excellent drinks and food.
March 29, 2013|The food was outstanding,|5|The food was outstanding, large selection of apps to share, all at reasonable prices. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly, getting us in to our table even though we arrived ~20 minutes earlier than our reservation. Very nice view of the river. Definitely recommended!
March 29, 2013|First time and we will be back!|4|Great service, great food, great location! This was our first time at The Waterman Grille and we has a great table for two in the far corner overlooking the water. Can't wait to go back when the weather it's a warmer and dine outside!
March 28, 2013|My husband and I visited Waterman|5|My husband and I visited Waterman Grill for the first time for our anniversary. It was a very nice restaurant. The Filet Mignon was nice and tender and very flavorful! My husband had the Sam Adams Beer Battered fish and chips. He said it had excellent flavor as well. The sweet potato French fries were a nice change from the regular fries typically made with fish and chips. The Cole slaw was excellent and not mushy (like found with other fish and chips places). The dining area was small however made for a very nice experience all together. We will definitely consider returning for other private meals.
March 24, 2013|Took friend here for a birthday.|5|"Took friend here for a birthday. Food was absolutely amazing, cheese platter was an amazing surprise! SO GOOD!!! Wait staff was attentive and observant. Before he started waiting on the table he overheard me tell the water ""guy"" I would like a wine list and presented it immediately. Not overbearing just perfectly attentive. The scallops were amazing and the SHRIMP dish I had was the best shrimp dish EVER!!! We did have to ask to be moved because the small table they originally sat us at -we felt in the middle of two isles. They moved us as soon as they could. The function room downstairs is amazing and wish they served down there too! The manager actually comped $15 off our bill as a first time guest! WHO DOES THAT!"
March 22, 2013|By the water with great views|5|This great restaurant is just down the river from our Rowing Club and is well known among our members for it's good food and great martinis! If you come during daylight hours for brunch or a dinner in summer, you'll see Brown Univ and Narragansett Boat Club crew teams and single shells pass by constantly. I had a sea scallops and risotto, a spinach salad and onion soup, and my wife is vegan so she asked for the vegetarian menu which they have. Vegans can find vegan selections in the vegetarian menu. Atmosphere, Service, and Food are all great and you'd have to work hard to find fault in this long established neighborhood favorite.
March 19, 2013|We had not been to Waterman|4|We had not been to Waterman Grille in some time and I certainly regret that now. The food was wonderful, service was lovely and the atmosphere is almost magical. We will be back soon.
March 17, 2013|I am so glad my son chose|5|I am so glad my son chose your place for his birthday dinner. It was great. One reason we choose Waterman Grill was of your Gluten Free menu and the wonderful choice of vegetables and salads. One person in our party is on a special diet and she had more than enough choices. It is great to go out to eat when everyone can enjoy their meal. We will be back.
March 17, 2013|It took 45 minutes for our|2|It took 45 minutes for our brunch dishes to arrive. Too long of a wait and the food was not hot enough. Would not go there for brunch again but might try another meal. We did have a nice table overlooking the water and the Bloody Mary was very good.
March 17, 2013|I have been to Waterman Grille|5|I have been to Waterman Grille several times for brunch, it has never disappointed! Their menu changes frequently to reflect the seasons. Food is always beautifully prepared. Their brunch beverages include a blood orange mimosa which is amazing! The service is always polite and attentive.
March 16, 2013|This restaurant was advertised|4|This restaurant was advertised in a magazine (don't remember which one and we decided to give it a try. Glad we did. Everything was superb.
March 10, 2013|Waterman Grille good food and views|5|Walking into the Waterman Grille is like walking into someone's home.It was warm and inviting and the fresh loaf of bread on the open grill was the first thing we saw. Bartender and server were very knowledgeable and friendly. Great menu. We started with the Mediterrean appetizer (hummus, olives etc) and main course was the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Duck breast. Both delicious and ample serving. Fresh in house made baked bread was a treat. Banana bread with walnut ice cream dessert was nicely presented and tasty, but not a size you can share. Nice view of Seekonk River with swans and ducks provide a peaceful experience. Will go back in warmer weather to enjoy the outside dining experience and other menu options
March 6, 2013|Very tasty food and the 3|4|Very tasty food and the 3 course offerings are a good deal. Very noisy although the restaurant was not quite full.
March 3, 2013|GREAT place for brunch!!|4|We went there for brunch not knowing whst to expect. It was awesome. Really enjoyed it. Excellent choices and great view on the water.
March 3, 2013|I sort of just found this|5|I sort of just found this place online and decided we should give it a try. Was a super, pleasant surprise. I'd definitely recommend it. The new menu was fun and exciting. One dish we had was a potatoe pancake with ham and cheese and it was the scene stealer. I had the lobster grilled cheese and it wasn't quite as good. Too thick for my taste, the lobster was all the claw meat and not a lot of lobster plus there was a meager portion of extremely thin ham (prosciutto, I believe) on it that I could barely taste. I just picked a mediocre dish. Several items looked very enticing. We'll definitely add it to our favorites in Providence.
March 2, 2013|Great Restaurant!|5|We enjoyed a perfectly lovely evening. We look forward to returning in the future.
March 2, 2013|Valentines Day Resturant|4|A pleasant surprise. I can see why yelp recommended this place. My friend and I finished our meals and the waitress was very attentive to our needs. It is quite pricey so it will be a special occasion ordeal.
February 27, 2013|Fine Service, too!|5|Always reliable. Fine service...a great staff. Special thanks to Steven, Katerina and Amber. We love it there. Paul & Deb
Dined on February 23, 2013|Everything was excellent.|5|"Everything was excellent. The food was delicious. The place is great anad our waitress was very nice. But, I have an issue with wait people who don't write things down. As soon as they walk away you know you are not getting what you ordered. And sure enough I was right. Our risotto was ""taken"" by another waiter. Code for - forgot to place the order and my soup never came at all. I didn't need it anyway as the appetizers we had were plentiful and delicious, but just write it all down! Highly reccomend this place and will definately be going back. Could use valet parking though!"
February 23, 2013|Tables too close upstairs.|4|I really like this place however this is the first time I was seated upstairs. The tables were too close together. I felt like I was having dinner with the table next to me. I would recommend sitting downstairs in the room overlooking the river. Otherwise, really enjoyed the food as always. Great Greek appetizer.
February 21, 2013|Our first visit there and|5|Our first visit there and we were not disappointed. Food and service were great. Only criticism was the we were seated along the inside wall and it was a little too dark. We like to see the food and the menu. The only improvement we could suggest would be to bring up the lighting aong the inside wall a little more. But that is a minor flaw---the restaurant is excellent and we look forward to going back in the future.
February 16, 2013|Fantastic!|5|Exceeded my expectations. The food was incredible. We ordered two entrees and drinks and the bill was around $60. My fiance and I had a window seat looking out at the river. We had a great time. I cant wait to go back!
February 15, 2013|Waterman Grille has a varied|4|Waterman Grille has a varied menu with a few well prepared dishes for each diner's taste. Statler Chicken was served over a perfectrly cooked hash of large, seasoned winter vegetables and the Cod Stew had a flavorful seasoned broth. Waitstaff is knowledgable, plentiful and unobtrusive which is typical of the restaruants in the Newport Group.
February 14, 2013|Very satisfying meal;lovely evening|5|First time there. There was an additional special menu for Valentine's Day, where we made our selections. We're non-vegan vegetarians which limited our choices; we did our best but ended up with a few bits of meat here and there. We both had a shrimp and gouda bisque with pancetta crisp - delicious! He had a seafood cipollini (I think that's what it was called) which was beautiful and tasted amazing too. I had a simple fluke cooked to perfections on a bed of kale with chorizo bits. We shared a trio of pastries for dessert - varying degrees of yumminess. Wish I could upload a couple of pictures.
February 14, 2013|Ernie and I had an excellent|5|Ernie and I had an excellent dinner on Valentines day. The service was great and the food was awesome, beautiful presentation right down to the the contemporary plates. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The ambiance was just right. We had reservations for 645pm and as we were getting ready to leave it was much louder and more hectic so I'm glad that we had already eaten dinner and were able to dine quietly. Overall we will definitely be back!!
February 14, 2013|Disappointing!|3|Got there for an early evening dinner on Valentines Day. Place wasn't crowded and sat right down for reservation time. Drinks and apps came right out in a timely manner. Both our dinners came out reasonably timed. We both ordered steaks cooked medium. Hers was a bit overcooked for a tenderloin filet and mine came out well done. When i sent mineback, the host/manager brought it back directly apologizing for the mistake but it was the same piece not 30 seconds later. Again sent it back to more apologies and after a short time, my new steak was back on the table. I've never had a piece of gristle as bad as this was! I've been here prior to this and was why I went back. Waitress was great! sorry, not heading back again soon!
February 14, 2013|Everything was perfect for|3|Everything was perfect for our valentines dinner...the service and the atmosphere....until we received our ribeyes that were suppose to be cooked to medium. Both steaks were so tough they were difficult to cut let alone chew. We really should have sent them back but we didn't want to make a fuss. Everything else was perfect but don't order the steak!!!!
February 14, 2013|Valentine's Day|5|The Waterman Grille is a great place to meet friends and a romantic night out. The food is always consistent. They made my Valentine a special plate and it was terrific. He was so surprised when they brought it to him. I love this place.
February 6, 2013|Consistently good food|4|I like Waterman Grille, I always have. The food is good and inventive, not necessarily spectacular, but solid, thoughtful, seasonal, and tasty. It's great for a date or for a meal with friends. The prices are a bit high, although not unreasonable, and you do feel like you get a good dish for the money. The 3-course prix fixe on weekdays for $24.95 is a good deal, but I'm still nostalgic for the bargain it used to be at $19.95. Overall, it's a place I'm always excited to go back to, and never really leave disappointed. Service I have had a few problems with before, food is always consistently good and enjoyable. If you get a view of the river, or better yet, a seat on the deck during summer, then Waterman Grille will probably make your day:)
February 2, 2013|Wonderful Restaurant|5|I never write reviews but felt compelled to write one for Waterman's Grill. This was our first time going to Waterman's Grill and it is by far has become one of our favorite restaurants. I have a Celiac and this restaurant not only has a wonderful Gluten Free menu, serve gluten free bread and crackers but are very careful and knowledgeable about food allergies. Their regular menu is wonderful also. Our server was truly fabulous and we look forward to returning soon. I highly recommend them and can't wait to go back. 5+ Stars!!!

January 27, 2013|We brought a couple of friends|5|We brought a couple of friends who hadn't been here before and they loved it and can't wait to go back. The Grille has really taken service to a higher level. Our waitperson was perfect! The food was as good as always - brunch with a mac-and-cheese for the table to share. Even though it was freezing outside, it was warm and sunny sitting by the window. Couldn't have asked for anything better.

But then Blake came by, apologized for the delay and moved us to a more desirable table by the window with a water view! Lovely. Fabulous food as always-a favorite of mine and my husband.
January 19, 2013|Best birthday dinner|5|I surprised my husband for his birthday. The seat by the window was perfect and the bartender and waiter were so friendly and pleasant! It was a perfect night

January 18, 2013|Restaurant Week at Waterman Grille|4|I went here with a friend during the restaurant week. The menu was pretty good. My friend ordered oysters as a starter and I ordered a mushroom bisque. We were both very happy with the starters. We both ordered short rib over cauliflower puree and overall it was fantastic. I had the espresso creme brûlée and it was good. My friend ordered warm banana chocolate bread pudding with ice cream and she thought it was way too sweet. We requested to sit by a window to see the water, and they made that happen. However, it was a bit cold right next to the window and we were putting our coats on towards the end of the dinner. Overall this place is has been consistently good. Service could have been snappier but I have to say it was a busy night.
January 18, 2013|Although the food and service|4|Although the food and service were outstanding.......the noise level was unbelievable. We sat at a small table just for two and had to yell to hear each other. Outside of that it was fantastic!
January 12, 2013|I recently took my girlfriend|5|I recently took my girlfriend here for her birthday. The greeting at the front was very nice. I had made a reservation and requested a table along the windows. They seated us in the area I requested so I was very happy. Our servers name was Jackie and she was one of the best servers I have ever had I would give the service an A+. We got a bottle of wine she did proper wine service.I ordered the Grilled Gulf Shrimp entree. It was absolutly delisious the shrimp was perfectly cooked it was paired with an acorn squash risotto and a fresh salad with a cranberry sauce. My girlfriend got the duck duo the duck was cooked perfectly it melted in your mouth. Everything we ate was full of flavor and fresh
January 12, 2013|The service here was outstanding|4|The service here was outstanding -- attentive without being overbearing -- while the food was very good, almost great. The cheese plate appetizer was excellent, the fish tacos were very good but a bit bland, and the salads were plentiful and fresh (though the salmon topping one of our salads was suprisingly bland and not charred with any of the wood fire flavors we expected). Also, the flourless chocolate torte was top notch, but the espressro was just so-so. All in all -- and especially because of the friendly service -- this was a very nice experience, and we'd gladly return here.
January 11, 2013|Have enjoyed the restaurant|4|Have enjoyed the restaurant several times. Enjoyed a specialty drink before the meal. The scallops entree and lobster mac and cheese were great. ordered a side of chef's risotto which was a good amount but too much for 2 people ordering meals.
January 11, 2013|Great Choice!|5|The food was fantastic, creative and delicious without being unneccesarily complicated, great flavor combinations. The seafood we had was cooked to perfection, so many places over cook it! The mussels melted in my mouth! The service was just right, we never felt rushed, and the atmosphere warm and comfortable.
January 6, 2013|Cool Place|4|Amanda was a great waitress. We ate from the Fix-priced menu. Everything was great. We love this restaurant.

December 24, 2012|Awesome place to dine!|5|First visit to this restaurant was on Christmas Eve and it was a wonderful experience! Great service and the food was delicious!
December 18, 2012|Dinner with a view|4|We frequent the waterman grille regularly. Tonight we had a lovely meal. My scallops were wonderful. The setting is perfect there and service was great tonight.
December 16, 2012|This was my second time at|4|This was my second time at Waterman Grill. Amazing! I tried the 3 course meal for two which included two 3 course meals with a bottle of wine for only $60. I had the sweet potato gnocchi with duck confit as an entree. The gnocchi was delicious and tender and the duck was so crispy. I will definitely be back again soon.
December 16, 2012|A great find in Providence|5|The only thing I would change is that my server was overly attentive.
December 8, 2012|Food was, as always excellent.|4|Food was, as always excellent. Out of one of the specials even though it was only around 7:15 when we ordered. We had a late arriving party member, the staff sat us, served us, and timed our main course (I'm sure it was a happy coincidence) for about 30 seconds after her arrival, including the order we had put in for her. They were great. We sat in the special event room in the downstairs which is a nice room but it was WAY too cold. Plus the room is a bit industrial feeling in the way it is lighted and sparsely furnished. You could see it as a place where you would hold a wedding, but with just a few larger parties, we kind of felt like we were sitting on a dance floor in the middle of everything. But that's a small nit.
Dined on December 8, 2012|Very nice restaurant with|5|Very nice restaurant with a reasonable number of quality menu choices. 3 diners selected three different entrees, and we were all very happy. Service was great, reservation was honored and the ambiance was nice. We would like to return with some daylight so that we could enjoy the view a bit more.
December 1, 2012|My husband and I went there|4|My husband and I went there again for our anniversary and the night was great. I would say excellent if the waitress didn't forget about us. She was great all night and then asked us if we wanted to see a desert menu and came back 10-15 minutes and by that point we were disappointed. We saw her set up a table and serve wine to another table and then help bring food out to a larger group. While doing all that she walked by our table repeatedly and could've dropped off a menu.
November 30, 2012|Perfect Choice|5|From our first hello at the door, service was very attentive. Food was excellent, don't be afraid to ask to have your food Tweaked ... They ate very accommodating. The food was a 10, as was the service. Wine list is just OK, but don't let that stop you from going.
November 30, 2012|Add to your Procince A list|5|W've eaten everywhere in Providence nd were looking for one last spot before son finished at Brown. Waterman was terrific. Better than Al Forno, Hemenways's and nick's (great bit slow). Almost as good as Gracie's. farm to table, ample RI portions and delightful fire on chilly eve.

November 5, 2012|The Waterman Grille is by|5|The Waterman Grille is by far my favorite restaurant in the state. The menu changes with the seasons and is always delicious. The prices are moderately priced and the food you get for what you pay is amazing. There is no reason that with food like this they shouldn't have higher prices, but alas, GREAT prices. The creme brulee was the best I've ever had, and the french onion soup was delicious. Scallops- don't bother going somewhere else, unless its another NHC restaurant because you will NEVER have scallops this fresh, meaty, and delectable. Never had a bad bite at the Waterman Grille.
November 4, 2012|As always we had a great meal|4|As always we had a great meal here. It has become a must each time we visit Providence. We really appreciate the gluten free and the fact that they are willing to modify basically anything you order to your preferences. My daughter wanted a mushroom risotto, which was not what they were offering, however, they made her one anyway. The duck was prepared perfectly.
November 4, 2012|Awesome river view and a spectacula|4|Awesome river view and a spectacular place for Sunday lunch/brunch with out of town guests. Lovely to watch rowers go by on the river outside while dining. Plenty on menu to satisfy breakfast lovers, lunch lovers, and even two fussy kids. The place was bustling and noise level got a bit high for my personal comfort level, but that is my only complaint. Service was great, food excellent.

The cheese plate featured local cheeses which were very flavorful. The bisque was a wonderful choice as well. Our main courses were pork tenderloin and steak. Cooked to perfection! We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to others.
October 17, 2012|Love Waterman Grille|4|"I really appreciate that the Waterman Grille has wonderful food, consistent service AND I especially appreciate the evolving sensitivity to gluten free and to our requests that they add more vegetarian menu items. They've managed to do this in such a way as to not lose their identity as a restaurant well known for ""grille"". Also, kitchen has been very accommodating with special requests. GREAT martini!!"

Had the waterman burger and a cup of onion soup, date had the lobster grilled cheese and a cup of squash bisque. Burger was cooked perfectly, juicy and yummy. Onion soup was good, would have liked more broth, lots of bread and cheese. Lobster grilled cheese very rich, date couldnt finish it, just ate the lobster meat out. Squash bisque was very good as well. Sat at the bar, bartender was friendly and quick.

I had the bruschetta with sauteed mushrooms, the sweet potato gnocchi with duck confit, and the banana cake. All three were terrific. I'll definitely go back to sample more of the menu!
October 7, 2012|nice brunch|4|First visit - 4 friends coming from different directions, this was the perfect meeting place. We had Sunday brunch at about 1pm. The brunch menu is excellent and very reasonable. Good range of offerings. The special Eggs benedict served over lemon biscuit was great, just a tiny bit salty. The location is great, nice views on the river and best of all plenty of parking! Will definitely go back, can't wait to try dinner menu. The downstairs space would be lovely for small wedding or other celebration.
October 1, 2012|Hidden gem!|5|This was our first time here and we will definitely be returning. The food and atmosphere were great and the view was very nice.
September 30, 2012|Mixed Bag|3|We were celebrating a birthday. The table was perfect, but the room was too noisy to have conversations across the table. Cold air was blowing down on us as well. Service was mixed. A bit snippy, and other times fine. Food was good overall, though one app had to be sent back to be cooked more thoroughly.
September 30, 2012|Lovely Brunch at Waterman's Grill|5|Had a lovely Sunday Brunch at Waterman's Grill. The food and service was Ist class as normal. The Crab cakes benedict were outstanding.
September 30, 2012|You have to try their Sunday brunch|5|Well, they've got me hooked now. It was a rainy Sunday and perfect for brunch overlooking the Seekonk River. The restaurant has improved the bar service, so drinks are delivered timely. Corey Barriera's crew was attentive, but not oppressive. The breakfast items were wonderful, the lobster grilled cheese was an interesting option, and the mac and cheese was fantastic as always. An absolutely great place for brunch at incredibly reasonable prices.

Love the view from the tables! Creme brulee was perfectly cooked and my espresso was delicious. Staff was all very friendly - can't wait to go back again. thank you! :)
September 17, 2012|Great Place for Early Evening|5|What a lovely restaurant for an early dinner on a still warm fall evening. The scullers were practicing up and down the river, inside diners had just as good a view as the folks sitting on the beautiful outside balcony. We have been to this restaurant several times and it always seems perfect - it has a menu that will satisfy anyone looking for a unique dining experience, but also has fantastic looking burgers and wood grilled pizza for the kids in the group. I love this place.
September 15, 2012|My husband & I were disappointed.|3|My husband & I were disappointed. To start, we were seated at a tiny table in front of the door going out to the patio. The wait staff was walking past our table constantly. It was a chilly evening so every time the door opened I got a blast of cool air. I was very pleased that they have a fairly comprehensive gluten free menu. I ordered the GF scallops. My husband ordered a pizza from the regular menu. The food was ok - not great. We both found it to be salty. Even the bread had a salt coating on the crust. My husband picked the crust off and ate the center of the bread only. On the up side, we had a friendly and knowledgeable waitress. All in all, just ok. We will probably not go back.
September 15, 2012|Waterman Grille enjoys a very|5|"Waterman Grille enjoys a very good reputation; based on our experience it's well deserved. Cordial and prompt service, and excellent food. I had the Lamb shank and it was slow-cooked to a turn and HUGE, delicious with an olive-based sauce. The Mac and Lobster was terrific. We shared the Creme Brulee and the Chocolate Bread Pudding. Again, very, very nice. My only ""complaint"" was the baked-stuffed potato, lukewarm. The chef stopped by and my wife mentioned it (I wouldn't have bothered) and he was suitably apologetic, offering to redo it. It was fine. A caution, decide when reserving your table, if you want to sit outside or inside. We WERE NOT allow to make that decision when we arrived (and this was at 5:30, mid-Sep.)"
September 15, 2012|Gem for a special occasion|5|My fiancé and I had been here before and had a good dinner, so when we were looking for a place to take my grandparents to celebrate their 58th wedding anniversary, I thought immediately of Waterman Grille as a beautiful place with good food that wouldn't break the bank. We sat on the covered porch overlooking the river on a beautiful evening, and had an absolutely lovely dinner. My grandmother said the lobster Mac and cheese might have been one of the best things she's had, and she's traveled all over the world, so that's saying something! My grandfather loved his waterman burger, and my braised short ribs were excellent. The mussels, as always, were a highlight, small (the mussels, but not the portion) tender and fresh.
September 14, 2012|The only negative comment|4|The only negative comment that I could give was that we couldn't get a reservation until 8pm, but then again, we didn't call until that afternoon. It's a reflection of how popular this restaurant is. We did get seated on time and the staff was friendly and efficient. The food was awesome. Everyone's meal was prepared to perfection and the bread....... Oh! the fresh bread right out of the oven!!!! Can't say enough about that! Just an overall great experience.

September 14, 2012|Great location, scenic place|2|Great location, scenic place to dine, with average food and good service. The kind of restaurant that gets its supplies from Sysco rather than local providers. I had the special fish dish for the evening and it was tasty but simple in presentation. One could say the fish was overcooked. In a major city this would be viewed as a tourist restaurant only.

It was my daughters birthday and that was her request. The manager was apologetic and gave us each a free glass of champagne. Other than that food, wine and service were great. My filet was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor. I love the Waterman salad, it's like a little treasure hunt because all the goodies are on the plate under the lettuce. Try not to fill up on the bread, it's excellent.

September 1, 2012|Good night out!|4|"Good food at a reasonable price is the best way to sum up the Waterman Grille. Does not compete with the ""food as art"" spots in Providence and doesn't pretend to. Everything is comfortable and easy, from the parking to the ambiance. Both our meat and fish entrees were well prepared, the service was solid, and the price was appropriate. Highly recommend for a good restaurant experience that doesn't break the bank."
August 31, 2012|This was our second visit|4|This was our second visit to Waterman Grille. Our experience was a good as the first time. Service was excellent. Andrea, our server was sincerely friendly, stopping by several times to see if there was anything else we needed. The food quality was excellent, as was the view of the river from the dining room. I would have liked it if it was a little quieter, but with a dining room full that's not likely to happen. In all, it's a place that I'll go back to again and again.
August 31, 2012|You have a great location|4|You have a great location and the food and staff are very good but at the same time there is something lacking...can't quite put my finger on it. Very good but not extremely special. In any case, very good and enjoyed your restaurant. Thanks! Bill Howe

August 24, 2012|Good food—spotty service|3|We had a lovely experience dining on the terrace on a warm summer evening. Our drinks and food were very good. Service was spotty—it took us 30-minutes to finally receive our drinks after placing our order. Service improved as the restaurant started thinning out. Service problems seemed to be a management scheduling issue as our server, Kristin, was delightful and hard-working throughout our dinner. We would recommend Waterman Grille for someone looking for a casual, nice restaurant with better than average food.

It's a good thing we ordered a mac and cheese for the table (which somehow came out first, though we ordered it last as an afterthought), and it was delicious. Drinks from the bar were also slow. Next time I will remember about the slowness and maybe order drinks at the bar and carry them to my table and eat a little something just before we go so that the wait doesn't seem so long. The brunch is good and reasonable. The view is very pretty. I will definitely go back.

July 9, 2012|Creative Cuisine|4|Although pricey, the food and service was very good and creative. The three of us enjoyed the pan-roasted fluke,accompanied by diced beets,potato,and corn-basil broth. We took advantage of Providence Restaurant Week and ordered from that menu. One of my friends asked if she could substitute creme brulee for one of the listed desserts, and the waiter was very happy to oblige. The special Monday- Wednesday menu also looked enticing, and I will go back to try those offerings.Our only complaint was that the air conditioning was too high.

I have always enjoyed Waterman's warm ambiance, American/NewEngland style menu, and of course the view. The staff is always knowledgeable and nice, and this night they really were outstanding with their accommodations of my sister and the 10 month old. We found ourselves very happily talking about how each staff person was quick to pick up a dropped baby item, offer a sippy cup, or simply re-set my sister's placesetting if she took the baby out of the room for a moment. It made me glad that I could take my sister out on the town. Thank you!!

The menu, while not terribly extensive, does vary seasonally, and includes a variety of appetizers, salads, entrees, etc. that should be enough for every taste. Fresh local products are featured (and delicious). The food is well presented, cooked well, and served attentively. The restaurant is very clean and the decor suitable boathouse-like given the location. There's a nice view of the river with outdoor dining when the weather is accommodating. Plenty of parking.
June 27, 2012|Perfect Birthday Dinner|5|My boyfriend and I went to Waterman Grille for his birthday. We originally wanted to sit inside by the window, but it was so nice out, we requested to sit outside by the water and were moved immediately. We ended up choosing the option of two three course meals and a bottle of wine for $59.95. We were worried the portions would be smaller, seeing as it's an excellent deal. To our surprise, they were not. We both started with a salad--which was brought out immediately, along with bread and our chardonnay. Our entree's were amazing as well. I chose the shrimp linguine and he chose the steak--a bit well for MR. For dessert we had a banana cake and a flourless chocolate cake. We couldn't have been happier with our experience--and we left full!

The food was excellent (salmon was perfectly grilled, lobster mac and cheese excellent). Good dessert, too. Very reasonably priced and good value. We had a 3-course dinner plus a bottle of wine for about $25 each. The wine list also seemed to have good choices, had we chosen to order a bottle. Comfortable place with nice views of the river both from inside and on the outdoor deck. I noticed some attractive function rooms downstairs. Gracious staff - thank you, David. Would definitely recommend (have done so already to a co-worker).

My new favorite is the superb Duck Two Ways on the dinner menu; one of the great duck dishes of my life. Ted Baar

I've already recommended your restaurant to friends. It was delightful sitting outside--unfortunately it was too humid an evening, but we did it anyway.
June 18, 2012|The seating that faces the|3|The seating that faces the river is really a lovely setting for an early evening dinner. Service is wonderful and everyone works to ensure that you are comfortable. The food is fresh and well done. On first arriving, the noise level was moderate, but shortly there after, it became difficult to carry on a conversation. It was a busy night with lots of small and medium size groups that may have added to the noise volume.
June 18, 2012|Waterman Grille's location|3|Waterman Grille's location on the water makes it a lovely destination when ambiance matters more than the food itself. Unfortunately, on this visit to the restaurant, much of the food was mediocre. Three of our party of four ordered the mussels as a starter, which was very good, but the entrees were far less palatable. A steak ordered medium-rare arrived well-done; the pasta with shrimp and peas was bland, with nary a pea to be found. The creme brulee for dessert was fine, but the lemon sorbet was so icy that it was difficult to spoon up. It will be a while before I visit Waterman Grille again.

We got a table by the window with a clear water view and that seemed to make the dreariness of the weather just go away. As a family of five we were able to taste five dishes and they were perfect for the evening. Adequate servings and timely arrival the combinations of steak with fries and salmon with chard and lentils complimented our hunger. The menu was just enough to read. We will return.

April 18, 2012|The Perfect Wednesday Night|5|The Waterman Grille is always a favorite spot of ours, but on Sunday - Wednesday Nights, they offer an amazing Three Course Prex Fixe Menu that is definitely worth the trip! The portions are generous and the selection is diverse - the value ($20.00/person) cannot be beat! We have always experienced great service there, and last night was no exception. We will be back!

Management was concerned and we had a good chat so there were no hard feelings whatever. They will be having a new menu soon so another try would be good to consider. Food is usually very good - the other day the chemistry was not there between us. But, do give it a go

The window-side table was waiting for us when we came, just in time for dusk views of the river. The specials which were added to the already generous prix-fix menu were extraordinarily done (eg. curried lamb stew appetizer). The service was attentive and knowledgeable. And all this right in the neighborhood. So nice to be surprised again.

March 30, 2012|Fantastic!|4|The food, the service, and the ambiance at Waterman Grille was absolutely phenomenal. I don't think I've ever had such great service. It was just the right amount of attention, friendliness, and know-how. My only complaint would be the limited space available while you wait for your table. There was absolutely no room by the host's station, and the bar area was cramped. I felt like I was getting in the way of the servers, but I had no where else to go. Can you open up the downstairs room for overflow? Perhaps open the bar down there if the room's not been rented? Otherwise, my dining experience was pleasurable and I will surely be returning soon.

February 26, 2012|Good meal. Watch 4 sly drink sales.|4|"The dinner was wonderful and reasonable as the four of us all picked the prix fixe, for $19.99 each person gets an appetizer, entree and desert (alcohol not included, $10 more gets you a bottle of wine. ) We all passed on the wine and alcohol because we had already had drinks prior to our reservation. We ended up ordering 4 sodas. Our waiter, Jason was very attentive and kept asking if we wanted more sodas and refills, we said yes. What we didn't know is that we were being charged for each ""refill"", so we had a soda bill of $40 by the end of the evening. The manager promptly removed those extra charges when addressed. While I would highly recommend this restaurant, take note of this waiter's sly manipulations with the non-alcoholic drink"

It was too bad that the weather was terrible, because we couldn't see the view. However, we will definitely come back in the summer when they offer outdoor dining. I am looking forward to going back!

I'll be back with the husband for a date night to be sure. The short ribs were fabulous as were the starter I had with clams and white beans, although the beans and sauce were too salty (and I like salt). The carrot cake was not too moist and had just enough cream cheese frosting, not overly done, a great balance.

Here in late November, so the view of water was all dark, but I bet it is real nice in the spring/summer months. Waiter was very attentive (Mike?) and enthusiastic about our options. Duck Spring roll was excellent as were the scallops. No room for dessert. Only down side was lighting, very dark, so bring your menu flashlight. Another downside was table location. Even though it was an empty Monday night, I was seated back to back to a young child who kept pushing his chair back into mine. Minor issue, but a different table would have been a good choice.

Wish it was closer to home, would visit more often but it will be part of the rotation going forward when considering restaurants in Providence. Only disappointment was the deserts.

My fiance and I have gone each year for our anniversary, and have never been disappointed. The past two times, they had an exceptional buffalo chicken pizza that served as our appetizer. It was a departure from the norm, with caramelized onions and gorgonzola cheese on a thin crust. In its stead we chose a margherita pizza with roasted chicken, which deputized very well. A bowl of the crab and jalepeno chowder, left me with little room for my main course. My fiance ordered the lobster mac n' cheese and found it somewhat lacking, and I varied from my norm with the lamb shank, which was tender and delicious. Lovely atmosphere, quality service, great food.

October 8, 2011|Overall, food was good. Two|4|"Overall, food was good. Two in our party had a ""signature dish"" (steak) tender to eat, but not as easy to cut. Onion rings were overly salted. Other meals were great. Great views and great, energetic atmosphere. They offered a rewards card for their restaurant groups loyalty program. Had been to other resturaunts in the group and was not offered - nice touch and perk as we dine out often."
October 7, 2011|craving more healthy options|4|We liked the Waterman Grille, but were trying to be healthy eaters.Our food was very tasty, but I found myself ordering a veggie on the side to offset the onion rings and mashed potatoes on my plate. Really good when you are hungry and we were!
October 4, 2011|Excellant|5|I love this restaurant especially the fixed price menu. The steak was melt in your mouth perfect.
October 1, 2011|Great place!|5|I am always pleasantly impressed by this restaurant each time I go. I forget how reasonably priced the menu is. There is a great variety of foods on the menu and everything I have ordered is delicious. Good wine by the glass menu. It seemed a little noisy last night but we tolerated it well. Not sure any older person would tolerate the noise level so well. We had a table on the river side as the sun was setting - it was beautiful. There was an assortment of waitstaff taking care of us. Our waitperson was energetic, enthusiastic, had great recommendations when we asked and overall seemed to like her job - such a plus.
October 1, 2011|Waterfront dining in Providence|4|We had a great dinner here the other night. We found the menu to be varied with lots of choices and moderately priced! I had the blue cod stew, which was overall I thought was good, but the size of the entree would not be enough to fill my husband. My husband had the lamb and he was stuffed by the size and thought it was excellent. I think the best deal is their price fixe menu served Sunday- Wednesday! 3 courses for $20 or add a bottle of wine and the dinner is $50 for 2 people. You can't beat that! BTW, The brunch menu also looks delicious. We will be back!
September 27, 2011|Food was great - always is.|3|Food was great - always is. They've recently removed some great dishes - like the tuna! Service is terribly slow!
September 26, 2011|The restaurant was a beautiful|4|The restaurant was a beautiful setting right on the river. Great menu with seasonal changes. The butternut squash soup and lobster grilled cheese sandwich were delicious, although rich and very filling. Nice wine selection. Would definitely go back our next time in town.
September 24, 2011|Seriously Underwhelmed|2|Perhaps my wife, two friends and I expected too much, but between the bottle of wine we bought, some desserts and main courses (no appetizers, salads), we spent over $200. It was most certainly not worth the price. The setting was nice, the noise level outside moderate, but the food and the service simply didn't measure up. Of course, both the food and service were considerably better than most venues, but Waterman Grille still significantly underwhelmed. Our server was attentive, but she was not familiar with a number of the menu items and saw fit to talk to us about her disagreements with her boyfriend about what they like to eat, and not just at the restaurant. The food was *good* but simply not worth the price. We will not return
September 21, 2011|First time here. A fine and|4|First time here. A fine and friendly server, and the view looking out over the water is very pleasant. Had their signature crab and fire-roasted jalapeno chowder garnished with cornbread crumbs, which was very tasty and only mildly spicy which didn't overpower the crab. Panko-crusted blue cod was very well done, and the chocolate cake was excellent. All this for $19.95 prix fixe is a super deal, and then a glass of Sakonnet (perhaps the best Rhode Island winery) Vidal Blanc for $5.50 is a huge bargain. Worth coming even without the price incentive.
September 18, 2011|Where to begin? This place|5|Where to begin? This place is an absolute gem. I saw it about a year and a half ago and had been wanting to try it. It's set in an old bridge keeper's house high above the Seakonk River in Providence. The style and design of the building and interior space is warm, tasteful and impeccable. The view of the river from inside the dining room as well as from the wrap-around balcony/terrace is wonderful. The staff is warm and welcoming. The food is stunningly delicious. The burger was one of the best I've ever had. I really hadn't expected such an all around perfect experience. And I look forward to returning to the Waterman Grille as soon as possible.

Had the fish special, was tautog over a veggie medley of spinach, carrots, squash, was excellent, so flaky and sweet. my girlfriend had the short rib and sweet corn dish and it was super tasty, smoky bar b que sauce and onion straws. The corn on the cob was grilled and had a wood fire taste, kernels were firm. only complaint was they had a wedding going on in the room below the restaurant, and even though we were sitting outside, the thump thump of the base from the dj was over powering, ruining our idea of a nice quiet meal outside on the patio overlooking the river.

August 2, 2011|Tucked Away in Providence|4|We went to the Waterman Grille for our anniversary- it was a great night. During the week, they have a great price fixe meal, and it is romantically/ quietly tucked in down by the river. Lovely deck seating if it is nice outside. Service was great, they knew it was our anniversary since I had said so on the Open Tables reservation form, and they offered us a free toast! We don't drink, but appreciated the sentiment.

Our only complaint: it was a hot day...........under the A/C we were freezing
July 10, 2011|East Side Waterview Gem|4|The staff, as always, is very attentive and professional. The brunch portions were a little smaller compared to other places, but, tasty, the price was reasonable and it is a nice way to enjoy this lovely location if you cannot always afford a dinner out.

Our waitress explained that it was her 2nd day so we gave her the benefit of the doubt but it was over and above slow service. Our meals were overcooked and luke warm at best. Needless to say, we will not be going back there or recommending it to anyone.
June 21, 2011|A Hint of France on the Sakonnet|4|The deck seating over the Sakonnet River was the coup de gras for a night out with freinds celebrating the passing of our graduate exams. Watching the Brown crew team practice was an added bonus while we sipped an outstanding Kir Royale. The 3 course dinner special made the evening memorable and affordable. Kudos to the pastry chef for the truly French Crème brûlée!

June 11, 2011|Historic Evening|4|I'm new to Providence and had been meaning to check out this place since I discovered it on a walk around the city a couple of weeks ago. My wife and I arrived early last Saturday evening in the mood to celebrate. I had requested a table by the window on the river side. We spent three relaxing hours there enjoying good food, good wine, excellent service, unique ambiance, the water view, and each other's company before heading out for some dancing. The ambiance derives from WG's original purpose: the gatehouse for the old Red Bridge, which once connected Waterman St. in Providence with Waterman Ave. in East Providence. Until 1970, it was home for the bridge machinery and the bridgemaster. Thanks WG. We felt at home there too.
June 10, 2011|Great Food & Service|5|Went with friends and family for a special occasion dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was busy, and our server Jason was wonderful. The food was superb, Phil's BBQ braised short rids are a wonderful summer treat! The atmosphere and view of the river are gorgeous as well. Definitely will be back again soon. They also made the birthday celebration a memorable one with the special dessert :)
June 3, 2011|great dining experience!|5|Food, drinks,service was top notch! Our dinners looked fantastic and tasted fresh and delicious. Entire staff was friendly from beginning to end. Only slight turn off was that the crowd at the bar was a bit noisy but other than, this was a great dining experience and I would recommend the Waterman Grille to everyone.

Arrived around 7:30, prepared to wait but were seated within fifteen minutes. The server was friendly and answered our questions regarding the menu. Ordered grilled scallops with risotto, and asked that the vegetable risotto be substituted for the one which customarily accompanies the scallops. Not a problem. My spouse got a steak which was, ""Okay but had been tenderized too much."" All that I ate was delicious and promptly served. I especially liked their bread. Satisfied, we didn't order dessert. Then, we were surprised with champagne flutes garnished with strawberries and happy anniversary wishes. How thoughtful!"

May 6, 2011|Facility & ambiance were excellent!|3|Facility & ambiance were excellent! Staff was wonderful! Food/presentation was beautiful! But flavor of the food? Sadly, there was none. Ordered signature Waterman sirloin; perhaps wood grilling dries out beef more than other means of cooking, esp. when ordered medium well as I did. May not dry out as much if ordered more to medium or rare, and I am willing to try it again to find out. However, even dry beef should have flavor. Needed better attention to spices, jus, garnishings, etc. Felt like we were getting the quality of food to be expected in a good airport restaurant, where one can appreciate the decor and speedy staff attentiveness, but where one doesn't really expect food describable as fine dining', as we did expect at WG.

We had a comment about too much salt on the salad. Instead of acknowledging this concern, appreciating our comments, and closing with a thank you and hope you will return, she began defending the situation and making us responsible for correcting the situation. She needs customer service training. We dined on Friday April 1 and now reconsidering whether we will return, based solely on our negative experience with the manager. I'd like to give you her name but she never gave it to us. Another mistake

The only reason I didn't give a perfect rating was because our table was right next to a server station, and the server's conversations got a little loud, and were a bit distracting, and a couple of times they ran into the back of my chair (felt like someone kicking the back of your seat in a movie theater). I would still recommend to others and it wouldn't stop me from going back again."

This was our first time going there for brunch. Breakfast entrees ranged from about $7-$14. Lunch options were also available. We chose a crabcake benedict that was delicious: two poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce atop two crabcakes- no English muffins- served with homefries and fruit salad.
March 12, 2011|Great for Couples|4|My wife and I have found our new date destination. Waterman Grille has a great view of the water and a nice upscale feel. We were seated promptly, our server was excellent, and the manager coming to check on us was a nice touch. Not the place for kids, but a nice lively atmosphere. It's not the biggest dining area, but I would describe it as 'cozy', not 'crowded'. I never felt claustrophobic or anything. The lobster in the lobster mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had. My wife loved the sangria. It has a great menu, and I have already decided what I will be having the next two times I go.

If you are looking for a quiet place to relax and enjoy your company, WG is not the place. We couldn't even hear our waitress when she was giving us the evening's specials. If you go during the summer, it is quite different. They have tables outside and doesn't seem so loud. I would recommend it in the summer months.

A lovely spot to go when you're visiting Brown, as we were. But the service was very slow. It was not very busy, and I had to hunt down the waitress more than once. Not great.

December 14, 2010|Coming from Chicago on a cold|5|Coming from Chicago on a cold winter's night, I was immediately warmed up by the Waterman's glow and ambiance, the smell of wood burning and the old New England feel inside the bar/dining room. The butternut squash with lobster soup was delightful, packing a healthy dose of lobster within a creamy orange/brown base. I followed that with the filet which was an excellent cut, very tender and covered with a blue cheese walnut crust which was good, however a bit overpowering. My dining companion had the short rib stroganoff which was excellent, a large portion of boneless ribs served on a noodle base. Compared to Chicago the prices were outstanding with two of us dining (with drinks & wine) for less than $100
December 10, 2010|Two appetizers (Ahai tuna|4|Two appetizers (Ahai tuna tartar and squash and Lobster soup) were outstanding. Main courses (shrimp and grilled tuna) were not up to that level. Service was excellent. Interesting list of beers. Noisy. Parking lot very convenient. I look forward to going again in the spring when it is still light in the evening so we can fully appreciate the view.
December 4, 2010|I have greatly enjoyed many|2|I have greatly enjoyed many previous visits to the restaurant. The last however was made almost unbearable by the exceedingly high noise level in the upstairs room. My companion and I were seated next to a large, boisterous party in the middle of the room. We could barely hear our own conversation.

November 20, 2010|Dinner for four on a Saturday|4|Dinner for four on a Saturday night. The menu was limited but the food was beyond excellent. I highly recommend the duck spring roll, delish! Our waitress was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The wine list is small and not all mixed cocktails are available from the bar. The other annoying thing was that we had to practically yell to talk to one another because it was so loud in there. I would go back maybe during the week.
November 14, 2010|What a great find. I had my|5|What a great find. I had my daughter pick the restaurant for our theater night. We usually eat closer to PPAC but I am glad we ventured out of the neighborhood. We both picked from the fixed price menu. What a great value. I had the squach soup and she had the salad, both great. We both had the steak,fantastic, we didn't finish it because we wanted to leave room for dessert. I'm glad we left room,when my daughter's creme brule arrived, I thought the serving was for 2. The chocolate cake was also large. Everything was great. We will definitely return. Kate B was our server and she was very attentive and effecient.
November 14, 2010|Comfortable ambience almost|4|Comfortable ambience almost cozy, but a little too noisy. Salads were outstanding, My veal chop was cooked perfectly but with the stuffing a little too heavy for me, although the stuffing was delicious. Loved the pairing with beets and mushrooms. My daughter is not a fan of spices and found everything a little too spicy for her liking- the bread the fries, even the roll on her hamburger was an herbed roll. She loved the pumpkin cheese cake.
October 31, 2010|Had a great meal and a wonderful|3|Had a great meal and a wonderful evening. Server was very professional and friendly without being overly intrusive and the food was great. Portion sizes are a little large considering the richness of the food, but that just means you get to take some good eats home.
October 31, 2010|Overall it was a good experience.|3|Overall it was a good experience. The noise level was fairly high and was not helped by the piped in music. Given that it is quite a live space - Brick, harwood floors and glass all around - I see little need for the music that one then has to talk over to have any decent conversation. The food was very good and our sever was most helpful, but service was quite slow for a not very full place. A good scenic place to take out of town guests but also one where the menu is not second place to the scenery. The Gluten Free menu is an additional plus and clearly not an afterthought to jump on the latest trend.

October 30, 2010|Waterman Grille is great place|4|Waterman Grille is great place to meet and have the chance to talk while enjoying excellent service and great food. Appetizers were delicious (4 of us shared 2 appetizers - the calamari appetizer and the fig and prosciutto appetizer) and 2 of us had the surf/turf special. While I wasn't a fan of the mushroom duxelle (it was too pasty, which was the way the waiter described it), the scallops were cooked to perfection and the steak was cooked exactly right. The pomegranate and walnut salsa was unexpected and very fresh and delicious. The Limoncello dessert was excellent, and enough for 2 to share. I recommend this hidden gem wholeheartedly, and all 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed our visit!
October 24, 2010|We four diners had very nice|4|"We four diners had very nice meals, served very quickly! When I made the reservation I stipulated that we had tickets to a 7:30 performance, and everything was handled very well. This restaurant has been off my ""radar screen"" for a while, but I am very happy to have rediscovered it. We will definitely be back soon!"
October 23, 2010|This is a nice place, great|4|This is a nice place, great atmosphere (warm and comfortable yet stylish), unique view during the day and delicious food. Those I was with had an appetizer who's description didn't tempt me but in the end it was really great. The dinners we had were also very good. Good size portion for a good price. Drinks took a while to get but they were worth the wait. I would certainly recommend putting this into the rotation!
October 19, 2010|Overall things were good but|3|Overall things were good but we got the food too quick after the salad and felt rushed. So by the time we were ready to eat the food, it was not as warm as it should have been.

October 9, 2010|I have to say that some external|3|I have to say that some external factors hurt my impression of this restaurant. My friends and I visited Providence on Columbus Day weekend. There was a huge festival and the Waterfire event going on that weekend in the city. Due to the large crowds, it took forever to get to the restaurants location outside of downtown. We sat upstairs and had a fan blowing in our faces. When we asked, the waitress lowered it, but told us she couldn't turn it off because the upstairs would get too warm. The food was good, not great. Service could have been a bit more attentive.

We waited a few minutes and they gave us a nice table by the window. The drinks were delicious and the food was great !!! We also received a complimentary dessert because it was our anniversary. A very nice touch that was greatly appreciated. Will definitely be back.

The food starts with a classic American menu, then gets interesting with insightful seasoning and combinations. Showed us unexpected aspects of familiar dishes. Responsive & friendly staff, with good suggstions. Excellent value.
September 26, 2010|The menu is excellent with|4|The menu is excellent with some small-sized pub fare plates such as sliders that my kids enjoyed, and also many sophisticated dishes. I had a very well prepared duck with lentils and my husband enjoyed his grilled shrimp. I had a perfectly prepared, strong, ginger margarita. For dessert, we had a creme brulee and a chocolate layer cake. The dishes are not unusual enough to make it a true foodie destination, but the food we had was delicious and attractively presented. The restaurant is perched over the Seekonk River and is was fun to watch rowers shoot by. The opposite river bank is a bit industrial, so it isn't a five-star view. I plan to return to try the Sunday brunch!
September 26, 2010|We arrived to a very inviting|5|We arrived to a very inviting welcome even though we arrived a bit early for our reservation. Catarina, our server, was very attentive. We had the three course special. Chowder, Salmon, Creme Brulee~Shrmp & corn frittas, Cod, and Chocolate cake. Loved both appetizers. My cod was good, but not spectacular. My friend enjoyed her salmon. We both shared the Creme Brulee which was delicious. I took my cake home and it still in my fridge. I have always wanted to sit out on the porch area where there is a scenic view of the river. On cue, scullers went by. This is a beautiful location. It is an intimate setting, so very nice for a romantic dining. It is about the food after all and my cod did not measure up to the ambianc

The 49.99 prix fixe special with meal and wine is a great value. Food (steak option with prix fixe) was good, not outstanding, but we'll come back for the atmosphere and service, and try a different entree next time.

We loved everything about our experience other than the noise level in the dining room. If someone was looking for a romantic evening they would probably prefer to sit outside.

August 17, 2010|We started with the cheese|5|"We started with the cheese tray appetizer. The cheeses were fabulous, the fig compote was a marvelous companion to the cheeses. The cave ripened Gruyere was fabulous. I had the bourbon brined chicken breast. It was juicy and very tasty. The cream sauce was light and very flavorful, the garlic mashed potatoes were as good as any I've ever had. My husband started with the ""chowdah"" and was pleasantly surprised. He didn't expect to love a chowder with sweet potatoes in it, but he did. Also had the pan-roasted Blue Cod, it was very light and flaky, perfectly prepared. He really didn't care for the chorizo hash. He felt it didn't compliment the dish. The raspberry sorbet was delicious, and the creme brulee was the BEST, thin crust- luscious!!"

I had a taste of everyones meal & I'd have to say the calamari & chowder where the best I've ever had!!

The waitress was wonderful and very attentive and the food was delicious.They also had a special that runs Sunday-Thursday for a prefix 3 course meal for only $19.99 per person- we tried that and it was WONDERFUL!

The setting was wonderful--watching the swans and the boats on the river was pleasant, and because you are facing east, the sun is not in your eyes all through dinner. The service was efficient and polite. The mid week special of $49 for two with a bottle of wine included was exceptional. The menu choices were interesting, and presented well. However, other than the salad and dessert, our meals were both too salty. We had different fish dishes, and I had to scrape the salt crust off of my salmon to eat it. We have dined here two other times. On the first occasion my meal was too salty, as well, but the second try was great. I'm not sure if it is the chef on certain days, or if I was just unlucky.

A brief, but intriguing menu, with great food and excellent prices, in one of the most picturesque corners of Providence. Lively downstairs, serene upstairs, and colorful out on the porch. I do wish the servers would not stop by just after every course to be reassured that the food is good. We don't go places where we expect it might not be. I wonder if any diners find this new tic helpful?

We went for my mother's 90th birthday (her first celebration, there will be more!) and she actually picked up that the waitstaff were from Johnson and Wales!! She said that they worked perfectly together. (they being staff). Food was good brunch fare, although I do wish that they had a few more selections. I would have like to have had some salmon; there was one fish dish on menu, a cod, but I opted for mac & cheese and fruit cup. My sister had french toast (yum), my mother had an omelet served with potatoes and fresh fruit as was the french toast. Delicious coffee, drinks well made.

The noise level in the dining area was unbelievably loud. Couldn't hear our own conversations due to the level. It was mostly groups enjoying Father's Day and brunch, but the walls or building materials somehow amplified the conversations making the whole experience lose appeal.

June 13, 2010|3 month later, we went back|4|3 month later, we went back to Waterman Grille for brunch. The waitress was different but we had the same outstanding service. This time the food took some time to come, but I understand they had a baby shower party going on. But this didn't alter our experience as we were not in a rush. I am taking a star off the food because while the eggs were perfectly poached, the bread tasted like wood fire grilled (awesome), and my husband choice (steak) was thoroughly cooked and his plate neatly arranged, I noticed withered pea greens on my plate and my daughter found brown salad in her garnish. I had the special (poached eggs on a chives and goat cheese biscuit) and it was very interesting, very good and new to me. Overall, 85/100.

Only upon arrival did we realize we might be seated outside (on a chilly night), so asked that we be seated indoors. Also, we stipulated a normal-height table, not one of the tall, ""barstool"" tables, because we find those uncomfortable. No problem - we were seated on time and at a nice table. Prices were reasonable, too. We thought the menu was very brief - there were not very many choices. The server was very pleasant, but food delivery was slow, and the food was merely O.K."

There were a couple of large parties and a function going on, so it was a little hectic coming in and the small entrance was tough for us to find a place to stand as we awaited our table. It was way, way too loud as my wife and I said ""what?"" to each other after each statement. Tough for a romantic evening. My food was a little salty for my taste, but I think it was just a wrong dish choice for me. My wife liked her's very much. We will definitely try it again, after graduation season is over or maybe during the week when it is less busy. You can tell that it can be a very nice experience - cozy and great decor feel. We had a great waitress-Amber"
May 26, 2010|Great restaurant. Delicious|4|Great restaurant. Delicious food and a great 3 course fixed menu for only $19.95 person or $49.95 for two with a bottle of wine. More than worth it.

Unfortunately, the service was the worst we have ever had in Providence. 20 minutes to get a drink, over an hour before the appetizer arrived, and when we finally got our entrees, it didn't have the special request we had ordered. The dining experience was ruined by the bad service.

Some diners sat outside. Seemed a little cold for that but it must be great on a warm evening. The restaurant has a small seasonal menu that you can order from Sunday-Wednesday. Appetizer, entree, and dessert for $19.95. The food was excellent and they don't scrimp on the portions at all. Plenty of parking. Highly recommended.

My wife had the stattler chicken, and was also very good, the smashed potatoes were to die for. For desert, we had the creme brulee, and it was perfect, with a hard shell and a creamy filling. I also tried 2 of the specialty drinks, the El Hemenway was excellent, a nice infusion of rum and grapefruit juice, perfect balance. Ye old Gateway was overpowered by the gin, it hid the gingerale and bitters

No, the houses and industry across the way aren't that pleasing to look at, but the water is and there were swans swimming in tandem as we gazed outside. It was beautiful. The hostess was great and our table was ready quickly. The food: amazing! From Sunday-Wednesday they have a special for $19.95 which includes 2 courses and a dessert. If two people in your party get this special, you can also order a bottle of wine for $10 more. What a steal! The dessert portions were very generous and I was completely stuffed! My boyfriend and I took our Mom's out for Mother's day and they were wowed! I would definitely go back aga

It's so relaxing and comfortable, but professional and courteous. The water view is awesome. The food is absolutely delicious. I always find something different, perfectly done and presented.

April 24, 2010|Phenomenal service from a|5|Phenomenal service from a recently hired waitress (brunette with a cheerful smile). Food was exquisite. I appreciate that the restaurant buys consciously from local farms and serves wild seafood as opposed to farm raised, when possible, and organic of course! Also nice to have a gluten free, veg. menu! Love the atmosphere too. Quiet. Although some other waitstaff appear to be in their teens, they are cheerful and attentive.
April 24, 2010|A great dinner out with a|5|A great dinner out with a nice view of the Seekonk River. The food was great with unusual entries. A had the Ahi Pad Thai which was not too spicy and the Ahi Tuna was seared perfectly. The fried calamari was wonderful as was the cedar plank grilled Salmon. Looking forward to returning soon to try other menu items.

April 23, 2010|I went to this restaurant|4|I went to this restaurant based on online reviews. It's a little difficult to find since it doesnt register on a GPS, however the restaurant held our reservations even though we were close to 20 mins. late which was a great surprise. The food was great! The food and wine selection was great. my only complaint was that the waitress continued to push the check while we were enjoying the view, even though she had many other tables and the retaurant wasn't near a closing point. This constant interruption was really annoying and we took our business to the bar after the waitress basically pushed us out. I highly recommend for romantic dinners or looking for a great view!
April 23, 2010|The staff were very accommodating|5|The staff were very accommodating as we were delayed and I was grateful that they seated us promptly and courteously (I had called, but that doesn't always matter). The service and food were excellent and the view was lovely.
April 22, 2010|This restaurant was wonderful|5|This restaurant was wonderful and they accomodated our requests that we made with the reservation for a table overlooking the water. The food was quite good, the waiter was friendly and knowledgable. It was a wonderful experience overall and I definately plan on returning.
April 14, 2010|Had a lovely time. Appetizers|4|Had a lovely time. Appetizers were ok, main course was much better but small. Dessert was wonderful. Good deal with the $50 with wine course option. The view and ambiance was very nice. Also, they were very accepting of our baby who we brought along with us.
April 13, 2010|The food was great and there|3|The food was great and there were no problems with it at all! My only negative comment was how I was treated by my server. I am 19 and my girlfriend is 18. Our server acted like she didn't care about us because we were the youngest people there and must of figured I didn't have much money. But what she didn't know is that I work for two very successful restaurants and I am at school in Providence for Restaurant Management. She came to our table twice throughout our time dining and only refilled our drinks upon request. When I received the bill I was shocked. I was only shocked because I was charged for each soda, which happen to be $2.75. Thats 11 dollars! Thats insane! But my overall meal was great and I would go back again...and drink H20

March 19, 2010|This was our first time dining|4|This was our first time dining at Waterman Grille and we were impressed. We were seated immediately at a lovely table overlooking the water. I ordered the Waterman steak which was cooked perfectly. Others at the table ordered the salmon, short rib stew, and scallops. Everyone loved their entrees and service was outstanding. I would definitely recommend Waterman Grille to friends & family.
March 5, 2010|I loved this place. My one|4|I loved this place. My one & only complaint (which is so minor I almost didn't type this) is that I ordered something (pad thai?) which turned out to be spicy & I'm pretty sure the menu did not describe anything spicy. That's a pet peeve of mine, since I don't do spicy at all! Otherwise, everything was fabulous.
March 5, 2010|I love brunch at Waterman|3|I love brunch at Waterman Grille, so decided to try dinner. It was good, but way too expensive - it cost as much or more as Gracie's and Farmstead, but not as delicious.

February 26, 2010|Main dining room is beautifully|2|"Main dining room is beautifully appointed with stunning water views. Maitre D charming. The space also quite ""live"" with nothing to absorb sound, so the din can get really annoying. Food was not so much. Mediocre at best. Awkward combos such as grilled turkey breast, sweet bread pudding and undercooked Brussell sprouts. Sent dessert back. Probably won't return."
February 18, 2010|Our table was ready upon arrival.|5|Our table was ready upon arrival. We had a cocktail at the bar. Our service at our table was excellent. I had the short rib stew which was excellent.
February 14, 2010|We got there early, obviously|3|"We got there early, obviously as a couple for Valentine's day. There were several more private 2 person tables free by the window; instead, we were seated in the middle, next to another couple. It felt as though we sat at a bus stop, as if these middle tables had been wedged in to accommmodate extra diners that night. We asked if we could be moved to one of the window tables, and were told they were ""reserved""...that was disappointing, and took away from the experience. It was not the atmosphere I had hoped for... In all fairness, the food was very good."
February 14, 2010|It was our first time at Waterman|5|It was our first time at Waterman Grille. It was recommended by a friend from Farm Fresh Mobile. We went for a Sunday brunch, and we will definitively try the dinner menu soon. The service was impeccable, the food fresh and awesome.
February 13, 2010|We had a wonderful Valentine's|4|We had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner. The menu and the food were both excellent. The Lobster Crepes were exquisite. The Lava Cake was over the top; loved the little cauldron in which it was served. There was a very nice wine selection. The service was excellent. It was a very pretty location although not quite as visible from the upper level where we were seated. The lit fireplace was a very quaint and appreciated touch.
February 13, 2010|We decided to go to the Waterman|4|We decided to go to the Waterman Grille for Valentines day. We got their Valentines day special, 5 course meal for ~$80. We made a reservation for 5PM, arrived on time and were promptly seated. The food arrived very quickly for each course, almost too quickly, but everything was delicious. The food portions were more generous than was expected, which made the meal a good bang for your buck. We both left the feeling very satisfied with our experience. It is a nice place to go for a special occasion.
February 9, 2010|Great location for a business|5|Great location for a business dinner. Easy to hear and be heard. Wait staff subtly attentive and not intrusive.
January 24, 2010|This was our second visit|3|This was our second visit - (our first was better). The timing of our courses was very off. But I think it was the kitchen's fault, not our waiter's. It was Sunday night and it was not very crowded. I also did not like my meal as much as our first visit, but overall it was good and we will definitely be back because there are plenty of menu choices and most of what we've had there we've enjoyed tremendously. The prices are also very reasonable... the prix fixe is a great deal.

Great service, the food was delicious, and the prices very reasonable for a three course meal for both of us and a bottle of wine. We have already recommended them to friends and will be back again soon.
December 13, 2009|Smallish, cozy, water view|4|Smallish, cozy, water view that's nice during summer. Food is excellent but not an extensive menu. Fireplace in one room but a smokey smell not good for those with allergies. Waterside room has expansive views. Across the river is scenic when leaves are out, but too industrial in winter. Seasonal outdoor tables. Reasonable prices, cheap brunch but excellent food.
December 11, 2009|I found the staff to be exceptional|4|I found the staff to be exceptionally congenial and the food to be really good, however the menu was rather limited in my opinion. The dining area atmosphere was very warm and inviting, however the downstairs lacks the cozy atmosphere it had previously. Overall a wonderful experience!

The food was wonderful and everyone loved their meal!! Prices are moderate and a great value for the quality of food. Highly recommend for a night out on the east side of Providence.
November 13, 2009|The food was delicious. The|3|The food was delicious. The waitress was awesome but did not like the fact that the only way one could acquire 1/2 price on appetizers was to be physically sitting in the bar which was two feet away. Our waitress brought the manager over to reiterate that it would be not be possible to get 1/2 price on the appetizer unless we physcially walked over to the bar area, which is within a few feet away, get the appetizer and then walk back to our table for dinner. It was rude, ridiculous and unnecessary....won't go back because of that experience.

October 23, 2009|This was my first visit to|5|This was my first visit to the Waterman Grille and I loved it! I was there to celebrate both my and my uncle's birthday and they gave us a great table by the water. The hostess also let us mingle at the bar for a bit and didn't rush to seat us right away. The restaurant setting is beautiful; great bar, roaring fireplace, a very homy setting. There is also a great room downstairs and second bar which is perfect for functions. The food was delicious! My husband and I both had the short rib stew and it melted in your mouth. My dad and aunt got the scallops and risotto, which was great too! All of the dishes on the menu, except for the filet, were under $20, so reasonable too! My family will definitely be coming back to eat here again!
October 21, 2009|Poor Service, waiter unprofessional|2|Poor Service, waiter unprofessional. Portion of steak for price was small. Food arrived lukewarm. Food was overseasoned- too salty on fish. Photo on web is great for marketing...but a disappointment to patrons when they arrive. This is a small space. View from windows are not highlighted with lighting so you can enjoy the water/setting after dark. NOT a must see in the Providence, RI area.

September 19, 2009|We have been to the Waterman|3|We have been to the Waterman Grille many times...it is one of our favorite places to go. This time we were somewhat disappointed. The portions were MUCH smaller than normal and the food was not as good as it had been in the past. They did not cook my steak properly even though I gave them explicit instructions on how I like it done. I got the strawberry shortcake for dessert and it was bland and tasteless. I think that the Waterman Grille has changed and it is no longer my favorite place sadly. : (

Dined on September 18, 2009|Was my first time to Waterman|5|Was my first time to Waterman Grille and can't believe that I haven't been here before. We happened to get a fantastic late summer night and we were able to sit outside. View is great of the seekonk river and the deck was a perfect spot for dinner and drinks. I thought the menu was great even offered a prixe fixed menu although we did not dine from that menu. I thought the menu offerings were great, my husband did not seem to love the selections. I got the filet and loved it and my husband got the tuna. The sides were delicious - the chef's risotto was unique with bacon and goat cheese, and the mac and cheese was YUM! Definitely can't wait to go back. Inside looked quite cozy too. Can't wait to return!
September 12, 2009|The menu was inventive without|5|The menu was inventive without being strange. The food was superb, and the atmosphere warm and comfortable. The walls and ceilings looked freshly painted. Because our table was adjacent to the stairwell, we could feel a slight draft. We will definitely return to the Waterman Grille for brunch or lunch to enjoy the water view.
September 12, 2009|The food at the Waterman Grille|5|The food at the Waterman Grille was incredible. I got the Cod Fish and it was better than any other grilled fish I've ever had. The waitress was polite and thoughtful: she got my girlfriend a special gluten-free appetizer because she knew my girlfriend can't eat gluten. They have an extensive wine menu; the perfect wine for every meal. I recommend getting dinner reservations for 6:30 so you can see the sun set over the river. I'm completely satisfied with my entire experience and I'll recommend the Waterman Grille to all of my friends and family.
September 5, 2009|It was a nice dining experience.|4|It was a nice dining experience. The food was good - nothing that I could say dazzled me though. Service was excellent! We were able to sit outside on the deck and that was quite lovely.
September 5, 2009|My husband and I had never|5|My husband and I had never been here before but decided to try it. Boy were we pleasantly surprised!! Even though it is a waterfront restaurant, it doesn't have the greatest of views. The neighborhood is not the greatest but don't let looks fool you! Once you get to the restaurant, it's like a little world of its own. My husband is a picky eater - often can't even find 1 or 1 items on a menu that appeal to him, but this particular menu had him stumped! He wanted to order everything! We were so pleased with everything we ordered - magnificent flavors and interesting food combinations - a feast for the eyes and mouth! We will definitely be going back here over and over again!

Located on the East Side of Providence along the Seekonk River, it attracts people from Brown University as well as from Providence and beyond. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is great.

August 21, 2009|Very delicious, but affordable,|4|Very delicious, but affordable, food. The menu has a great assortment and contains many different options depending on how extensive of a meal you are looking for. They have wood grilled pizzas (sooo good) and also full entrees. The atmosphere is second to none. It is fancy feeling with white tableclothes and nice silver, but not at all stuffy. I would feel comfortable wearing jeans there. The only downside to the whole experience was that the only beer they offer is bottled. Regardless, highly recommended!

I particularly found the ""Whitefish Beignets"" to be some of the best fried seafood cakes I have had, and the Creme Brulee for dessert also notably excellent."

July 30, 2009|The restaurant is hard to|3|The restaurant is hard to find. It's tucked away on Richmond Square in an out of the way location. I'm not sure it was worth the trip. Food was good, not spectacular. I had one of the signature dishes, the lobster mac and cheese, and it was not great. It had more breadcrumbs than lobster. My friend's cedar plank salmon, though, was very nicely done. Dessert was a highlight as the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate mousse cake were delicious. Considering other great places to dine in Providence, I'm not sure I would return.

July 18, 2009|We were seated at a small|3|We were seated at a small middle table by the waiters section, you know that little table in the middle of every thing. Any where but this table would have been wonderful. Our waitress put out bottle of wine in a ice holder near some one ele's table. She was never around. Not sure where she was. I don't think we will come back but if we did I can see sitting outside. The tables are just way to close to each other. Other than that and our missing waitress it could have been nice.
July 12, 2009|We frequent Waterman Grille|5|We frequent Waterman Grille for dinner but had never been there for brunch. We took my stepmom for her 75th birthday and it was lovely. Luckily, it was a beautiful day and we were offered a table on the deck. Kate, our server,was quick to deliver our blood orange mimosas and bellinis. I cannot wait to return and will order the delectable lobster salad on a croissant with perfect fries and a crunchy little vegetable salad. I remembered to use my Fare Rewards card when paying the bill and Kate informed me that the next time we dine at a Newport Group restaurant we will have earned a $35 credit. That's a great promotional tool! Well done WG.

June 30, 2009|Favorite restaurant in Providence|2|Favorite restaurant in Providence -I have lived here for the past four years. Great location on the water -out of the way location-near the office. Ambiance is very nice and especially like the fixed price dinners early in the week -good bargain! Food generally good -this time it was poor -such a disappointment... Hopefully just a one time problem.
June 29, 2009|We dined on a quiet Monday|4|We dined on a quiet Monday evening and the outside deck was a very pleasant place to sit and view the river. The staff was efficient and service prompt and friendly to my two kids. Drinks arrived promptly, orders arrived and were presented simultaneously by wait staff. The duck breast, lobster mac 'n cheese, and the steak were all perfectly prepared and delicious. I would definitely return for dinner again.
June 20, 2009|This is a nice restaurant|3|This is a nice restaurant with a water view. The staff are very friendly although our waitress started to flag as time went by. The food is very good and well presented. Unfortunately, my dish (the Veggie Enchiladas) was cold even though the server warned me that it had 'just come out of the oven'. It must have had a short visit! At around 10pm on a Saturday, we found ourselves alone in the restaurant and got the distinct impression that the staff wanted us out, even though there was a party going on downstairs. Not the best experience this time, but we like the restaurant and will be going back.
June 20, 2009|Maybe the recession has hit|5|Maybe the recession has hit harder in Providence than Boston, but I can't understand why there weren't more people here on a Saturday night. I made reservations through OT about 3 hours ahead of time and we were seated at a water-view table. The food is very good and reasonably priced. When it's warmer there is seating on a deck overlooking the river - I can't wait to go back.
June 19, 2009|Great views of the river!|4|Great views of the river! The wine was fantasic and so was the food. It's a great place to bring your gluten-free and vegetarian friends as there are multiple options for dinner! I'll be going back for sure - hopefully on a nicer night when we can enjoy dining outside on the deck overlooking the river!
May 28, 2009|I and my friends from NYC|4|I and my friends from NYC had a great time. Everything we ordered was very good, except for the pizza (one of the appetizers we ordered, which was a pretty much burned). We really didn't appreciate it. Calamari, Salmon, Sliders, everything else were very good. Including the Mango Mochito and the Wine.
May 24, 2009|We found this restaurant to|5|We found this restaurant to be a great experience. The view of the river is the main attraction. It was a sunday evening before a holiday so that the place was not overcrowded. Our wait staff was attentive and the food delicious. We were celebrating our son's graduation and I only wished we had come here more often during our other visits. I could tell from previous open table comments about asking for a window table but wished I had known about eating outside. It might be helpful to have a category of special requests
May 22, 2009|Was here for a college reunion.|3|Was here for a college reunion. Dinner got off to a rough start, when the waitress poured a gin and tonic on my buddy. But it was up from there. The service was a little slow but it was busy. We enjoyed our meals very much.

After a quick 10 minute wait we where seated across from the bar, near the kitchen in a high traffic zone. We asked to be seated in a vacant spot near the window however we where told that those seats were unavailable. 30 minutes later those seats where finally taken. The lesson learned for this place is be very specific when making reservations. The food was very good, exceptional for a brunch. However it was located downstairs and with two small children marching up and down a flight of stairs was a task. The 20% included tip was a bit much considering it was a $30 per plate Brunch. We will not be returning.

This place has a great view of the water and if the deck would have been open it would have been a great location to sit outside, opens in may, we were too early, but we plan on coming back!! The Blood Orange Mimosa is a must have if you go there and my friend said the Bloody Mary was perfect!! Coffee was nice too!! I liked all the fresh fruit you got with breakfast and the potatoes were awesome!! They had a few parties going on downstairs and the place filled up while we were there, nice place for anyone, kids included!!
April 18, 2009|Overall we had a really nice|5|Overall we had a really nice evening - nice view, great service, and good food. Only negative was that it was a little noisy with the bar adjacent to the dining area but overall a restaurant I would visit again.
April 12, 2009|This was our first brunch|4|This was our first brunch at Waterman Grille. We had dined there a couple times previously and the food was great. We were not disappointed for brunch either! We usually aren't buffet fans, but the Waterman Grille had a lot of choices that covered just about everything. No real complaints on anything and as usual there is a nice view of the river from the dining area. Be careful of the Mimosa's...they were a little bit pricier than we expected, but they were still very good.
April 12, 2009|Buffet was lovely, food was|3|Buffet was lovely, food was excellent, service was lousy. Servers who consider 2 women to be unimportant guests perpetuate their tips problems. Good service = good tips. Lousy service, no matter who the guests are, reaps lousy tips. Too bad this meal was a fixed gratuuity - meant no effort required or provided by the server.
April 12, 2009|I went with my family for|2|I went with my family for Easter Brunch and was extremely dissapointed. It was a reasonable price at $29.99 until you add $9 for a small glass of Momosa and the automatic 20% gratuity for a buffet! Four people came to over $200.00 and the food was just ok. The carving station cut pieces of meat smaller than a childs portion and made you feel like you were indulging by asking for a second tiny piece of meat. The baked good were terrible, dry and tasteless. The service was friendly and good but did not make up for all of the negatives. Certainly not a recommendation and we will not be going back.
April 12, 2009|View much better than the food|2|Came for Easter brunch the year before, so I was expecting to get the same pleasant dining experience. Boy was I wrong. It is my belief that whether we are the first reservation of the day or the last the food quality and longevity should be the same. The beef and lamb loin station had over-done meat that had probably been sitting out for at least 45 minutes or longer. Waitress was no where to be seen for the majority of the brunch. I had to ask the manager to please send her over so that we could get our plates cleared and more coffee. The rest of the food seemed stale like the meat station. We didn't touch the salmon for fear that we'd get sick, as it didn't seem to be kept at the appropriate cold temperature. Not a good experience.
April 5, 2009|The web site was not up-to-date,|3|The web site was not up-to-date, so we were not aware that it was Sunday brunch only until 3:00 and thought we would have a regular luncheon/dinner menu. We were disappointed in that aspect. But although we arrived after 3:00, we did call ahead. They agreed to serve us only if we arrived before 3:30 and took our order at 3:28 p.m.
April 4, 2009|It was our first time at Waterman|5|It was our first time at Waterman Grille and we went because we had a gift card for the Newport Restaurant Group. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and loved every morsel of food. The service was excellent, as well.

March 21, 2009|We have eaten here before|4|We have eaten here before with no complaints and ounce again it was very good. We went with another couple who had not been there before and they said they would go back again. There was one small glich and that was they ran out of the specials for the day by 8:30. Luckily none of us were interested in them anyway. Our waitress was very attentive but not to the point of annoying. We will go back again

The food is delicious, perfectly cooked, and with a twist - whitefish beignets with grilled corn-tomato tarter sauce, needle-thin onion strings, peppermint chocolate truffle cake with raspberry coulis and whipped cream. Most seats have a view of the river, which provides a lovely romantic setting as the sun sets. The bar is smallish but warm and lively, check it out !
March 14, 2009|We had dinner upstairs, which|5|We had dinner upstairs, which had a very ski-lodge feel to it, which added to the ambiance. Nacho & calamari apps were more than enough for the four of us. Notable wine list, like all the restaurants owned by Waterman's Mgt group. Although we did not have children in our party, there were some at other tables, so there were selection for their tastes, too. When the weather warms up, I believe they have a patio for outside dining, even if the river isn't a scenic beachfront...

With six of us dining, we had an ample assortment of food to sample, from oysters to steaks, cassoulet, chicken and cod - all delicious! The water view is great, and our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. The Waterman Grille joins our list of favorites in Providence.

February 21, 2009|I was so disappointed in this|2|"I was so disappointed in this restaurant. I had eaten there 3 times previously when it was the Gatehouse and loved it. This time the food was awful: Lamb shanks with no flavor; mushy crab cakes with little discernable crab; salad drowning in what tasted like bottled dressing. The upstairs ""attic"" has lost its pleasant feeling. Now is just crowded with too-bright overhead lighting. Window blinds closed tightly. The wait staff computer was behind one person in our party so the server had to lean over my friend's head to access it. The carpeting on the stairs leading from the main level to the lower (where bathrooms are) were dirty and water stained. We will not return and will certainly not recommend."
February 17, 2009|This restaurant does not disappoint|5|This restaurant does not disappoint! I have gone there a few times for dinner so far and the food, service and atmosphere are A+. Friendly staff and very professional. The pri fix menu is a great value. I am having my wedding ceremony and reception there in June and looking forward to celebrating with my guests. I know they'll love it.
February 15, 2009|Great location! You don't|4|Great location! You don't have to deal with Providence traffic and there was adequate parking. Staff was very friendly and the food came quickly after ordered. Wine list by the bottle was notable more extensive than by the glass. Overall a great experience and will definitely revisit again, great find!
February 14, 2009|Went for Valentine's Day with|4|Went for Valentine's Day with reservations at nine. Didn't get seated until nine-thirty, but having a drink at the bar downstairs was a welcome addition to our plan. Had the special couples' menu - great value at $60 per couple with an appetizer and dessert to share, soup or salad plus entree for each person. I was surprised they ran out of so many of the special menu items, but it was a busy holiday night, and they did substitute similar items off the regular menu. My steak was dry, but the appetizers (spring rolls, beef skewers, and crab cake) were phenomenal. Very attentive service from a friendly staff. Would definitely return, especially to try to the prix-fixe seasonal menu.
February 14, 2009|Great restaurant for a romantic|4|Great restaurant for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner. The view from here is great overlooking the Seekonk River and the ambiance was outstanding. There was a special menu offered in addition to the regular menu and both offered oustanding selections. The service was outstanding and the food exceptional! I would recommend this for a nice romantic dinner or if you're looking for a place that's tucked away and offers a great view.
February 14, 2009|We had a very nice meal at|4|We had a very nice meal at Waterman Grille. My husband, though, thought the lobster in the lobster crepe was a little tough. This is a minor complaint, especially given the volume of people they served that night (Valentine's Day). The wait staff was very prompt and attentive. We'll go back on what will probably be a quieter evening.
February 14, 2009|We have eaten at the restaurant|3|We have eaten at the restaurant many times in the past and have always had wonderful meals. This time we were disappointed. We were seated almost 30 minutes late to start with. Service was just ok, and our meals were not up to par. I think the restaurant was having difficulty with the Valentines Day crowds.
February 14, 2009|Waterman Grille provided a|4|Waterman Grille provided a beautiful atmosphere. They offer free parking across the street in a private lot which is a plus (and hard find) in Providence. The music was just right. The service was just right. The food was very good, but not extraordinary. They had coat check which for some reason not everybody does. I would definately dine here again.

February 14, 2009|Waterman Grille has been one|5|"Waterman Grille has been one of our favorite places of late. The menu changes often enough to keep from being boring but has enough ""old standards"" to avoid the trap of an unfamilar menu. In more than 10 dinings here, we have never had an unsatisfactory experience. I t is a small initmate space better suited for couples & very small groups although it has a larger, more ""group friendly"" area downstairs. We are not into ""hot spots"" so Waterman Grille is perfect for us. It's initmate space keeps it from being an overcrowded and noisy venue. It's perfect."

Great calamari appetizer, entrees: superb pan roasted sea scallops, great 12 oz. sirloin strip, and perfect espresso and cappuccino to finish! Very attentive service, but not overbearing... executive chef visited table to inquire about our reaction to the meal. Note -- Restaurant has riverside tables on main level deck for warm weather dining.

I was a regular in the 90's when this location offered fine food, a great bar scene and Clay Osborne was providing entertainment. So my opinion may be a bit jaded. The service was very good but the waiter didn't seem to want to spend any extra time with us. He seemed a bit rushed (although I couldn't see why) and maybe a little nervous (inexperience?). The food was good but I wouldn't say outstanding. My dining partner thought it was too loud but I was not bothered by the noice. The location is beautiful and I will certainly give it a second try when the weather warms up."

The restaurant was beautiful, the staff was outstanding, and the meal was awesome. It was a cold winter evening but it was warm and cozy inside, I can only imagine how special this location is in the summertime when you can eat outside by the water.

January 16, 2009|I have been to Waterman Grille|4|I have been to Waterman Grille on different several occassions and I always enjoy myself. The service is excellent and the food is usually very good. This visit however the crab and beef appetizers was salty as well as the mashed potatoes. I guess the chef was a little heavy handed with the salt. I still enjoyed myself and would definately dine again.
January 9, 2009|This is one of those restaurants|4|This is one of those restaurants where you get that dependably high quality meal regardless of what you choose usually serving up seasonal staples with slight twist that are intriguing... the meals won't necessarily blow you away, but I've always left contented and am willing to bet you'll never have any complaints. The patio seating over the river when the weather turns warm is a favorite of mine.
December 31, 2008|This is one of our new favorites.|4|This is one of our new favorites. The staff is the friendliest around, from the welcoming host and hostess, to our attentive waiter. Oh and let's not forget the Executive Chef who went out of his way to check that the meal was to our liking. We had the Cod and Paella. The portions were excellent, well seasoned, served hot, beautiful presentations on both. Two minor criticisms: the Paella seasoning was different than a traditional Paella. My girlfriend was disappointed while I found it to be a pleasant surprise...different strokes. The second is a criticism for this and other local restaurants; Entrees should come with two sides, I don't like paying extra for them. Overall, this was a nice dining experience and a pleasant surprise.
December 22, 2008|Our food was not worth what|3|Our food was not worth what we paid.... my $25 scallops were 4 small scalls with mixed greens and manderines and the steak came with a small portion mashed and one onion ring for about $20. Also it was absolutly freezing! Not what I wanted for a romantic couples Christmas.
December 13, 2008|This was my second visit to|4|This was my second visit to Waterman Grille. It was overall outstanding. My only area of disappointment was our server was not terribly friendly, but the other staff more than compensated for it, and they ran out of what my friend & I had ordered, so we had to draw straws to see who got the short rib. I lost & had the scallops, which were very nice, but not what I had been dreaming about.

Not ridiculous, but longer then normal considering it was not that crowded. Service was attentive. Only critique is when a customer asks for lemons for their fish, please bring a couple of quarter lemon slices. I was brought thinly sliced lemons that you would put in a drink. Gave me a good laugh though. Thanks.
November 15, 2008|We go here frequently and|3|We go here frequently and love it. This time the food was not as good as usual. I had to send back my food because it was overcooked. They were very good about getting me another dish but, everyone else was already done eating by that time and I felt rushed and not able to enjoy the meal. I think they have a new chef. The drinks were outstanding....especially the Blood Orange Martini.

October 23, 2008|Overall the experience was|3|Overall the experience was good. The food was excellent. All three meals were outstanding. We were seated in an area that was pretty noisy and made conversations somewhat difficult. The service was only fair. Our waitress was TOO attentive and did not seem to give us enough opportunity to converse and peruse the menu. Menus were a bit cumbersome to deal with considering the tables were small overall and cluttered.

I was disappointed when we arrived that they tried to put us at a table upstairs, without a view, in a corner. We were an early reservation, so there were plenty of tables. I would hope that members of Open Table would be shown to better tables if available, given the popularity of the service and the loyalty of its subscribers. I had to ask to be seated at a window with a view of the water. Considering they advertise that they overlook the water, this would seem important.
October 8, 2008|Excellent night at Waterman|5|Excellent night at Waterman Grille! Love this place and the food has always been terrific. This was for a special Harvest Menu dining and it revolved around apples for the 5 courses. Awesome, delicious, and great wine pairings!
October 7, 2008|Both myself and my dinner|4|Both myself and my dinner companion ordered the Fall Tasting menu. This was 5 courses all with a central theme ingredient and wine parings. The menu was quite tasty and very inventive. The service was very good. All the meals and wines arrived together. The table was cleaned completely between courses and the waiter was personable. We both enjoyed ourselves very much. I look forward to visiting again later into the season when the fireplace is lit.

The food was good enough to bring me back for a second try - the noise level is so extreme that I had to think about whether it was worth a second try. It's a shame, because it's impossible to carry on a conversation over that good food. It may be that summer dining on the deck may be the only way to enjoy Waterman Grille.

On a recommendation from a third party, we checked out the website and were impressed with the menu - particularly the ""Short"" menu with tapas-style entrees. We were not disappointed. This place has it all. Fabulous, knowledgeable staff; fun cocktails; great wine; and really superb food. Our orders included scallops seared to perfection; house salad with super-fresh greens and a really yummy vinaigrette dressing; sesame-crusted yellowfin tuna to die for - a really generous cut of deep ruby colored tuna, barely seared, with a terrific plum wine reduction; and sliders with shoe-string onion rings that literally melt on your tongue. Highly Recommend."

With a lovely view of the Seekonk River and attentive staff, the dining experience was very satisfying. Nothing is really elaborate and you leave having enjoyed both the food and your conversation with your dining companion. This is the second time I have been there for dinner and I find it a solid option on the Eastside of Providence. The reasonable price point makes it a place that I will return.

In short, I was not impressed with the food, wine list, or dessert. The restaurant fits into that category of more expensive than good.

When we arrived we were told the table was ready but the server already had a full section. They ackowledged that they received the open table reservation requests but apparantly were not interested in fullfilling the request. When I suggested a change, we were led to a table and greeted by another server. The server we requested came over to inquire why we did not get her, we told her of the situation. After drinks were served, we eventually ended up with the server we requested.We were disspapointed management to allow this to happen. Management did not offer anything for our inconvenience

The wine did not come with the food and one of my side orders was completely forgotten until I asked about it. I go out to eat 3-4 times a week, so I am very particular about certain amenities. Staff was pleasant. Will I try again? Yes, simply because the food had excellent presentation and was very good. We had the salmon and we were there because of Restaurant Week. I have been wanting to try this place for a while and this was just the incentive to do so. Thanks, Betty

My daughter and her boyfriend were visiting us from New York - they love good food and good dining experiences. The four of us sat outside on your deck overlooking the water. Everything was perfect, the service, the food, the weather. As there are few really good restaurants in the area we are delighted to know the Waterman Grille. For those patrons, such as us, who may want to frequent your restaurant we hope you keep your menu varied and offer interesting specials - after a while even the best items can become ""we had that recently,"" so a few new things every few weeks can be important to those of us who love to explore the world of food. Thank you for a very good experience."

The menu choices were not choices that would appeal to a wide range of customers; I had difficulty finding a menu choice. The salad I choose was fair, rather generic. The cod was fine but not exceptional. My husband felt the same about his entrees. The dessert we had was exceptional, a delicious and unique strawberry shortcake. We went a second time, our waiter was different and very good, but we found our opinion of the restaurant had not changed. Overall good quality food but not a place that would become a regular for us.
June 29, 2008|I've been there three times-|3|I've been there three times- the food is consistently excellent. But the service has always been mediocre (slow, not so polished). The service doesn't match the quality of the food.
June 28, 2008|This was our first dining|2|This was our first dining experience at Waterman Grille. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. My wife had the cod special which was very dry(overcooked). I had the tuna which was good. The crabcakes could have been a little larger!!! Also, my chocolate cake and my wifes lemon cake were extremely dry!!! We have had heard good things about your restaurant and traveled about 45 minutes to get there...but I don't know if we would go back. Maybe we hit you on a bad night. It was also EXTREMELY loud in the dining room. My wife and I had a hard time talking to one another. The champagne for our anniversary was a nice touch though.
June 28, 2008|We had a lovely time, except|4|"We had a lovely time, except that the waiter promised me the last ""special of the day"" which I was really excited about (fish over risotto with shallots - yummy!) and just before he brought the food out, he let me know that they were out and I had to pick something else. While they sent over complimentary dessert drinks that were really good, it still left me hanging on my dinner (I ended up ordering a salad, the seafood chowder and dessert). Everything we had was delicious though, so we might try it again."

June 15, 2008|We were really disappointed|2|We were really disappointed with our experience, especially after a most enjoyable dinner at the other sister restaurant Inn at Castle Hill on Thursday, June 12th. It was father's day brunch and the kitchen appeared to be severely understaffed, resulting in slow service and poor food. We had to send our eggs benedict back b/c it was overcooked. We only sent back 1 order while the other two guests in our party just dealt with it. It returned short one egg and missing the original potatoes and fruit. Once again, they had to go back to the kitchen to complete the order. Considering the amount of money we have spent with the Newport Restaurant Group, we will certainly re-think future dining reservations.

The food is great, with a super presentation and always tasty. The menu is limited, very few specials offered, but everything I have had, the mahi mahi, the george's bank scallops and the waterman steak, were all fantastic!

The ""share plates"" section of the menu has gotten less interesting than it was in the beginning. Then they were more imaginative and the selections wider. It was much better before."

The view was terrific- it's right on the river and it was a lovely place to dine! Our waitress was just okay but the food was terrific!
May 18, 2008|We had hoped to enjoy a nice|2|"We had hoped to enjoy a nice brunch with a pleasant view in celebration of a family occasion. The view was pleasant, but the service was brusque and the food was very disappointing. The Grill is supposedly famous for its Eggs Benedict, but mine was overcooked. Our guest's ""3 cheese herb omelette"" received an F rating, as it barely had any cheese and no discernible herbs. The coffee was terrible. Only the challah bread French toast was quite good."
May 14, 2008|the tables are too close together;|2|the tables are too close together; the noise was unpleasant; the service was obtrusive. I've eaten there twice before in the last month and on both occasions it was a pleasant experience. Tuesday was not. Wait staff must be trained not to interupt diners, not to whisk plates away when someone has not finished eating, not to hover repeatedly. I would also like all plates to be left until the last diner has finished eating. We were inches away from three very noisy women--as I said, the tables are too close together. I would be very happy to talk to the manager about this

Did not feel the bill should have had an automatic 18% gratuity. The waitstaff service was not commensurate with that level of service charge.
May 11, 2008|I didn't realize that there|4|I didn't realize that there would only be a buffet brunch on Mother's Day. I thought we would be able to order off of the menu. Despite that, the food was great, but perhaps something could be posted on the opentable website or the restaurant's own website to that effect to warn the patrons before they come. Thanks!
May 11, 2008|The brunch on Mothers Day|4|The brunch on Mothers Day was wonderful. We have gone two years in a row. The first year we were on the bottom floor near the food. This year we had to go down two flights of stairs to get to the food. We would definitely go back, but would request the first floor.

April 26, 2008|I found this Restaurant on|2|I found this Restaurant on the Open Table site. It looked very inviting, especially that it was on at the water, (river). Not being from the area it was off the beaten track from the city. The old river gate house was well decorated and intimate. The service was great. The price of the meals I thought where high considering all sides were Ala Carte.That wouldn't have been a problem but, the the portions were small. Not much imagination with the prep. If they do a little re-vamp with the menu I would consider returning. Just my opinion, but my husband and I dine out quite frequently.

April 19, 2008|Appreciated the very friendly|4|Appreciated the very friendly staff and the fact they were happy to accomodate a Birthday cake we brought in without problem. Was very pleased that they took note of a request for a table window by the river. This was a Saturday night at 8.00 p.m. (Usually these requests are totally ignored -particularly in Rhode Island.Too bad, so sad. Starts the evening off on the wrong step.) Yes - one can find better cuisine & service on Federal Hill in Providence, but for a less formal, fussy - and pleasant evening out this is an excellent choice.

April 12, 2008|The food was great, but I|3|The food was great, but I was surprised that the side dish I ordered of mashed potatoes for an additional $5.50 was probably the equivalent of 1/2 cup....for a meal costing $33.00 (for lamb chops and side of mashed) I would have thought at least 3 lamb chops, and a cup of potatoes.....we could go eat at Cattails City Grille and get twice as much food for half the price. also, it was 79 degrees on the thermostat and people were opening windows themselves to cool it down upstairs.
April 12, 2008|We were not greeted particularly|3|"We were not greeted particularly well, our reservation noted a birthday, which was not noted--there was not a candle on dessert order, or any mention of the occasion when we arrived, however when we walked out the door, the host said ""happy birthday"" (a little late!)...the table was not ready when we arrived on time, but was 1/2 hour late due to occupancy, but other tables in another room were available. We noted that the staff spends time talking with one another in the seating area frequently, which should be avoided. The food was good, not great, not particularly memorable this time. Not our first time in the restaurant, two out of four said they would return one more time. Thanks for inquiring."

April 6, 2008|This was a great surprise,|4|This was a great surprise, primarily because we didn't expect to find anything of this quality in East Providence. We drove around E. Providence a little bit, and our opinion iof that locale went up several notches. Back to the restaurant, we did think that the price was a little high for what we got, however.

April 5, 2008|I had read a review in the|2|I had read a review in the ProJo that gave it high marks. However while i thought the food was good, I thought it overpriced, I thought the layout of the dining areas contributed to overcrowding and a very high noise level (so loud we had to strain to hear each other). I booked the reservation on line, arrived a half hour early, and checked in. it was suggested that we go downstairs toa quiter lounge area which was nice. We were assured we would be called when our table was ready at 8pm. We checked at 8:30. Apparently the hostess never check us in and others assumed we didn't show. The appetizers were overpriced for what you received (don't order the cheese and crackers)and arrived shortly before the meal. Service was slow.Disappointing!

We've had 2 brunches & 1 dinner and look forward to our return. It is waterfront on a river but the view on the opposite bank is of some tenement housing. We don't eat there for the view but rather for the great food & service. The entire restaurant is VERY classy with bathrooms right out of the finest hotels. There our 2 private function rooms up & down from the main restaurant which is very intimate. I would guess seating for 50? Reservations are recommended. The function room downstairs has it's own bar, a grand piano, & a very tasteful courtyard. It's very easy to get to, right off the highway. The parking is free & plentyful.

March 23, 2008|I've been to the Waterman|3|I've been to the Waterman Grille for a company event, and the food was outstanding. The Easter Brunch was nice, but I doubt I would do it again. The set-up of the restaurant, unfortunately, overshadows everything else. The host staff was very friendly, and we had a lovely table by the window. Our server was nice, but far more interested in the large group next to us than in our party of 2. The food was good, but, the buffet was set up downstairs. We had to cross a slippery wood floor, cobblestones and go down a flight of stairs with wet looking carpet to get the food. As it was Easter and most ladies were in heels and there were older folks dining, it was rather inconvenient and we didn't get to enjoy the buffet as we might have...

My bestfriend is still talking about the macaroni and cheese. The receipe for the cookies that make up the cookie monster sandwhich is a gem. Being in the hospitality field myself, my experience just reinforced why I choose the industry. The way we felt Thursday is how everyone should feel when dining out. Waterman Grille is definately on my list of restaurants to frequently visit.

We took one of the desserts home with us and the slice of chocolate cake was miniscule, about 3 bites worth.The regular menu is MUCH better. They make great drinks. Try the Blood Orange Martini. We go there about once a month and were disappointed in the prix fixe menu. It seems as though the quality of the food was sacrificed in order for them to offer a prix fix at that price.
