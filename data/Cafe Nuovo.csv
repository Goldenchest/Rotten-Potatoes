The menu has a wide choice of dishes along with its beautiful presentation the food amazing and an absolute must to go to. I will be back again very soon.

February 11, 2016|Never Disapoints|5|Have been here multiple times, mostly for business dinners. This was a special night out with SO. Had an amazing dinner. It was a cold night and Café Nuovo definitely warmed us up. The wine selection was it's usual excellent as was the food. Will continue to come back.

January 21, 2016|Nice for business lunch|4|Lovely lunch environment. Not too crowded or noisy but still with a good energy. Ordered the special salmon and it was good but nothing special.
January 16, 2016|Fabulous|5|Café Nuovo is the best restaurant I've been to in a long time. The service was excellent and the food was outstanding. The food presentation was as fabulous as the taste. This is certainly a restaurant I will visit again.
January 15, 2016|Awesome time, great service.|5|will highly recommend to our friends, great food, service and atmosphere cant wait to go back
January 12, 2016|The best overall|5|It's the best full service restaurant bar none in down city. They actually truly care about the whole experience from greeting to exit. No other place does this in PVD.
January 9, 2016|A special occasion place|5|We had our wedding reception here and celebrated my wife's birthday. Our server was incredibly helpful tailoring a gluten & lactose free menu. The lump crab, shrimp, clam appetizers were delicious. Our filet mignon entrees were perfectly cooked and served with wonderful sides. Saturday was busy with three deep at the bar. But the buzz never interfered with the meal or the service.

January 6, 2016|Always a great meal.|5|Ive been numerous times and every time, it's always perfect.
December 31, 2015|New Year's Eve and Birthday Celebration|5|We spend our New Year's Eve at Café Nuovo every year. The food is amazing as well as the service. There is an extensive wine list. We had our 14 and 11 year old with us and the kitchen prepared chicken fingers and fries for them. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a great view of the city. There is a $15 per person surcharge on NYE for the 9:30 seating which includes the noise makers and hats and DJ. In the past there has been a champagne toast. There was no toast this year.
December 31, 2015|Gift card user|5|Restaurant was very nice and service and food were great. My only complaint was that we were seated close to five college students. Need I say more.
December 31, 2015|Absolute Pristine Dining|5|My husband took me here for our 5th wedding anniversary it was absolutely perfect! All the way from them taking us to our table which overlooked the Providence River...to the food and the service...I cant say better things about our waiter, I believe his name was Rob, who knew exactly how to do such a great presentation of the food and what it entailed before we even ordered it. The noise level was perfect ...considering it was New Years Eve, I was able to enjoy a nice conversation with my husband over our wonderful meal and glasses of wine..and the dessert...oh my what a wonderful dessert it was. Everything was perfect! Atmosphere, food, service..down to valet who had our car nice and warm and toasty for us. I cant wait to go back here again...this time in the summer time so we can sit outside.
December 28, 2015|Christmas celebration|5|Wonderful meal, our waiter was outstanding, very attentive but not pushy
December 26, 2015|Beautiful Food and View|5|We were shown to a lovely table overlooking Providence all lit up for the holiday season. The restaurant was softly decorated in silver and white, the table was perfectly positioned. The server was excellent in recommending wines to accompany our veal and lobster. The entrees were gorgeously presented and we ended with coffee. A wonderful evening with valet parking.
December 24, 2015|One of our favorites|4|Wonderful restaurant for special family meals. Our first time having lunch at the restaurant and it's a winner. Only complaint was the fish was slightly bland and the service a tad slow (odd, given that it was much less busy than when we've had dinner there).
December 23, 2015|Excellent in every way.|5|We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Cafe Nuovo. The food was beautifully presented, delicious and plentiful. Our server was very professional and knowledgable about the menu, including the selection of wine and craft beers. The pace of the dinner was pleasant too. We look forward to returning soon.
December 2, 2015|What's going on here?|1|This is a nice location, perfectly attractive dining room. It was half empty and I can see why. We sat at about 12:30 and waited for a waiter, then had to correct drink orders, waited an hour for our lunches. Food was heavy, unattractivly presented. Desserts lovely but too too. Finally done at 3:00. Never again.

November 7, 2015|Cafe Nuovo|3|I made this reservation very early, because I knew we would be in Providence at that time...and I requested a window table, which I knew might be difficult! But, did not expect to get stuck at the worse table in the restaurant, right near the kitchen with the wait staff flying in and out!! I requested a change, but was told it would be 45 minutes. Food was very good, waiter was great, but I think they could have taken a little more effort to accommodate with a nicer table....K.
November 7, 2015|SUPERB DINING EXPERIENCE|5|Three in our party, and we each had a wonderful meal. The meals were all delicious, top quality ingredients and beautifully presented. Our server and the entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very professional. A great find, and we highly recommend. We cannot wait for our next visit.
November 4, 2015|Can't go wrong with Cafe Nuovo|5|Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Always enjoy my dining experience at this restaurant

Our son goes to school in Providence and once we discovered this restaurant we always make a point to eat here. Everything we have tried so far has been fantastic.

October 28, 2015|Great food and service|5|The food and service were outstanding. Since we had a large group, I pre-ordered h'orderves for people arriving early--that went swell. There was no hesitation about modifying the meal to suit special dietary restrictions/preferences, e.g. preferring abundant veggies instead of starch and keeping gluten-free. Desserts were amazing, and I don't even like sweets. My main guest was Italian [really!]--he said the food was amazing--well, Italian food [in Italy] is probably #1 in the world [don't argue unless you've tried it]. Ambiance was sweet. Wine list was excellent with a full range of opportunities. I'd say, if you haven't been there ever or even in a while, give Cafe Nuovo a shot and prepare yourself for non-rushed, timely, enjoyable service of outstanding nouvelle cuisine.
October 26, 2015|Excellent experience|4|Best lamb chops in quite some time. Good place for dinner. Great service.
October 26, 2015|Always a special treat|5|Dining at Cafe Nuovo is always a special experience. We were seated at a table overlooking the river as requested. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgable. The menu had many interesting choices. The food arrived at a good pace and was creatively presented. The dining room was calm making it possible to have a very pleasant conversation with our guests.
October 20, 2015|Retirement Celebration|5|"The occasion was to celebrate a retirement. The staff went out of their way to make this a special event. We wanted to sample the appetizers so the staff assembled each plate with a sample from each of the appetizers that we had ordered. The desert plate came out with ""Happy Retirement"" piped on the service plate. Even the valet had my car in the circle with needing a request!! Awesome job. . ."
October 17, 2015|40th Anniversary Dinner|5|We went to Dinner for our 40th Anniversary. It was more than I could ask for. The Food was excellent, so was the waiter and service. We were not rushed and enjoyed every minute. They made it special.
October 10, 2015|Date Night|4|"My wife and I ate at Cafe Nuovo last Saturday night. We split the Cesar Salad which was wonderful. For our entrée my wife had the Scallops with the Risotto and I had the Veal Chop with mashed potatoes and spinach. My wife said her meal was outstanding. I ordered my Veal Chop med rare and when it came out it was rare. It also was very ""stringy"". The severer was excellent so I didn't bring the undercooked Veal Chop to her attention. Overall it was a good experience and I wouldn't let this meal stop me from going in the future as I have had several great meals at Café Nuovo over the years."
October 10, 2015|Saturday evening dinner|5|Our server Nicholas was quite knowledgable for wine and dinner menu. Our meal was one of the best I have had and it was topped off with a great dessert. Would definitely return and recommend for a special occasion

October 5, 2015|Both my boyfriend and I were excited to ...|3|Both my boyfriend and I were excited to try Cafe Nuovo for the first time. The decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant were fabulous. However, we found the service was lacking and the food to be mediocre. As two people who work in the fine dining industry, we found the lack of hospitality very disappointing. Shout out to Ted the server, for being the only person out of the staff we met to even tell us his name!
September 26, 2015|Food and service was wonderful.  Was a b...|4|Food and service was wonderful. Was a busy waterfire evening. However they didn't skip a beat with the food or service. My only complaint was we were sat in the back room and the wall was vibrating from very loud music next door at a wedding they were hosting as well. Put a little damper on the otherwise fantastic evening.
September 17, 2015|Excellent|5|I have heard many comments about this restaurant. I was not disappointed it exceeded my expectations for food service and ambience
September 17, 2015|Great food, questionable service.|4|No wait for our reserved patio table. The patio was quiet and dimly lit for the evening. Great wine list. The waiter was very dry and was almost rude from the beginning of the evening. He seemed annoyed anytime we asked a question about the menu or wine list. Filet and seafood risotto were phenomenal! We were on a business trip and needed separate checks and the waiter was very rude about it! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for the ambiance and food...not for the service!
September 16, 2015|Excellent location on the riverwalk|5|Stuffed rigatoni is fabulous, and the view of the gondolas is great too.
September 16, 2015|Excellent evening, went for our anniversary|5|We were impressed with our waiter, selection and food. We would certainly go back again. One of our most memorable evenings out in a long time.
September 12, 2015|Dinner|4|Overall the experience was great. The only complaint was it took 3 hours from start to finish. Our waitress did not communicate at all with us. We asked for the drink menu and that is exactly was we got - drink menu listing cocktails and beer. We had to ask for a wine menu. OK. Then it took her 30 mins to get us our wine. We looked around to see if bread was served, it was so we had to ask our waitress if we could have some. Then dinner took forever which wasn't her fault assuming she put our order in when she left our table. Other patrons that sat down after us were already leaving the table. By the end of the dinner as we were waiting for our dessert menu and check we made it a game of how long it would take to get all this. Probably would go again but would make sure we didn't get her.
September 12, 2015|Elegant experience|4|Fois gras and crunchy sushi apps were outstanding. Risotto with scallops were very tasty. Lamb shank was perfectly delivered including the bone. Traded the bone to a pooch's owner at Waterfire for a street side beer! Win win
September 11, 2015|Excellent food, view, ambiance & staff|5|Truly delicious food. Beautiful scenic view of river. Attentive staff. Fresh well prepared seafood. Exceptional calamari. Amazing steak. Sot outside along the river watching gondola boats pass by on a beautiful night.
September 5, 2015|Wonderful|4|Our server John was awesome he was very knowledgeable and never overbearing, incredibly romantic restaurant...The salmon was overcooked but all in all a wonderful experience
September 4, 2015|Reward Yourself !|5|You both worked hard all week. So Friday night take your wife out. We were greeted with valet parking and seated promptly. My wife had a unique coctail Indian River I think it was called : cucumber infused vodka and herbs- she loved it we followed with wine. I had a beautifully presented heirloom tomato salad and Opa fish She had crab cakes- the best ever and a meat dish expertly done with wine. No room for desert so digestifs: amaro averna and sambucca. Only slight compliant was dining room was a little too cold
August 29, 2015|Wonderful place to sit for Waterfire- great food|4|This Restaraunt had absolutely delicious food and it was right on the water which gave us a great view of Waterfire. Our waitress was wonderful and provided top notch service. The only reason I didn't rate the service higher was because when I made my 9pm reservation (MONTHS AGO) I indicated that I wanted a table outdoors. When I showed up they said they had no more outdoor seating. I am just wondering who it went to when I know I made my reservation WAY in advance. I told them I would wait until outdoor became available, and I am glad we waited an hour. It was worth the wait.
August 29, 2015|GREAT|1|GREAT FOOD, GREAT WAITERS GREAT DRINKS GREAT LAMB SHANK
August 27, 2015|Outstanding dinner|5|We came here for an anniversary dinner and were very pleased overall. We started with chorizo/caramelized onion/scalloped potato grilled pizza for an appetizer and it was delicious. I had the angus ribeye, which was cooked to my liking and my wife really enjoyed the short rib ravioli. Would definitely come again.
August 26, 2015|LOVED. IT.|5|I stopped in for lunch on a Friday. We were promptly seated outdoors by a very attentive host. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable on the food as well as the wine pairings. I would ask for him next time I return. I would recommend Cafe Nuovo to anyone who appreciates good food and great atmosphere.
August 24, 2015|Great service, excellent menu.|5|I love Cafe Nuovo. The service and food are outstanding. I would recommend this place to everyone. The service is impeccable and the menu can suit anyone's food mood.
August 22, 2015|We just returned from a trip in Monterey...|5|We just returned from a trip in Monterey Cal. and ate at some of their better restaurants. Nuovo blew them away with quality, taste, orginality, presentation, and price.
August 21, 2015|Great service and food!|5|The crispy sushi and salad special were amazing! Our waiter John was a gem!
August 20, 2015|Not the Cafe Nuovo of yesteryear|3|"20 years ago when we moved to Providence CN was a destination dining experience, part of the Renaissance of Waterplace. Architectural plates, exciting new flavors, stylish patrons. This Thursday in a largely empty room our 4- top waited an hour and 20 min for entrees ( and ""the kitchen was busy with another large party"" is not our problem & no excuse). Salmon was not served hot (? waiting in kitchen) & Steak/ Shrimp lomein was tasty but unattractively plated. Patrons dressed in shorts, sneaks & polos; where is ""smart casual""? So Cafe Nuovo you've gone from special to ordinary. Only the prices reflect ""fine dining."""""
August 19, 2015|Lovely location & excellent food|5|Was in Providence meeting a friend and Cafe Nuovo was recommended to me and it was a great choice. The setting on the patio was lovely just above the river. The menu selection was diverse and the food was terrific. Our waiter was helpful and although a bit pricey it was well worth enjoying a lovely meal with a dear friend. Thank you.
August 18, 2015|excellent|5|this is a restaurant that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys fine dining and excellent service.
August 12, 2015|Great view|4|Loved the lobster linguine. I would reccomend sitting outside on the river rather than inside.
August 8, 2015|Cafe Nuovo continues to please!|5|It's a go-to when I have out-of-town guests. The food, service, and outside dining are all exceptional. I strayed from my usual lamb shanks to try the evening's special swordfish; it did not disappoint. The swordfish arrived fresh and piping hot. My guests - visiting from Florida - were duly impressed. I look forward to dining there again soon.
August 8, 2015|Pleasant evening|4|Had a table of six, outside, sunset, great night, nice location, great food, staff and fun...
August 7, 2015|Terrible experience due to server|2|The ambiance was great when we were first seated outside by a very nice and friendly hostess, until we met our server. He was quite unpleasant from the very beginning but seemed as though he didn't care for his job or want to be there. He was not knowledgable about the menu at all, had a rude tone and very poor attitude and made us feel rushed during our meal. He even took away my friend's drink before she finished and didn't care to ask prior to doing so. During my desert order, I tried to request a coffee also but was interrupted and told that he will get to that in a minute. While setting plates he practically threw the plates on the table, which interrupted our conversation each time; and reached over my other friend to set the plate for some sitting next to her causing her to lean back awkwardly when he could have walked over to do so in a non-intrusive manner. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected superb service to coincide with the food and ambiance of the restaurant. I have been to many reputable restaurants in the area and all over the world and I have never felt so unwelcomed and treated so poorly. It really takes a lot for me to complain about service but it was one thing after the other and our experience for a very special occasion was ruined. I had to speak to the manager, who apologized for the negative experience and hoped that we would return in the future. I'm hesitant to return especially if that particular waiter is present and do not feel enthusiastic to recommend this place. Despite this experience, I must say that the food was very good. So if you do decide to go, I hope you get a different server, then you will most likely have a great over all experience.
August 1, 2015|Great all around!  Magnifico!|5|We had a fabulous evening - great ambiance, view, food, wait staff! And topped off by the most beautiful and delicious dessert - the Waterfire Mousse! Such a fun evening!
August 1, 2015|Always Spectacular!|5|Dining at Cafe Nuovo for my husband and me is a prince and princess experience. The warmth of the owner, manager, and assistants as well as the entire waitstaff is so obvious and heartwarming. This past Saturday, we were fortunate that our anniversary fell on a Waterfire evening so our experience with our Nuovo family was even more special. Food is always prepared to perfection from appetizer through dessert. Thank you, once again, dear Nuovo family for your countless efforts and superb service, and for making this anniversary a remarkable one.
July 30, 2015|Amazing food and service! Best Sangria I...|5|Amazing food and service! Best Sangria I have had in Rhode Island. Filet was cooked to perfection and my husband loves the Risotto. We will definitely return!
Dined on July 25, 2015|Consistently awesome|5|Went here for a birthday celebration and was one of the best dinners we have had all year. It's a bit pricey but the food and service is SO much better than other Providence restaurants. We started with 12 fantastic oysters, then I had the duck and my husband had the scallop pasta special. We sat outside and watched the gondolas. Very relaxing .
July 25, 2015|Mom's Birthday|5|I surprised my 83 yo mother with a gondola ride with rendition of HBday in Italian and violin music. This was immediately followed by dining riverside at Cafe Nuovo. The service and ambience impeccable. The food was served well presented, incredibly tasty and exploding with flavors. The produce was fresh. Everyone got a different dish ranging from lamb, rib eye, scallop and shrimp to tuna. All were exceptional.
July 21, 2015|Excellent Meal, Service & Ambiance|5|Love this place! Our waiter was outstanding- really amazing service! We sat outside along the river on a gorgeous summer night. There wasn't a water fire, but we loved watching the boats and gondolas go by on a nice quiet evening. Food was great- salads/tuna/vegetarian/dessert- all excellent. Really no complaints. We dine out regularly and Cafe Nuovo is just what you hope for in an upscale restaurant. Just go!
July 17, 2015|Cafe Nouvo|5|Enjoy a great dinner at Cafe Nouvo. Wether you sit inside or outside its a beautiful place
July 7, 2015|Some items better than others|4|We enjoyed our experience at Cafe Nuovo. The entrees were not as good as the appetizers and dessert.

June 27, 2015|Delicious food and great service|4|We enjoyed this restaurant as a place to celebrate our anniversary - all the food and service was excellent
June 26, 2015|Always sensational!|5|Have been here many, many times and have NEVER been dissapointed. Everything is sensational and the desserts are wonderful as well as beautifully presented. If I could post a pic here I would. It was a gorgeous evening and the terrace seating right next to the canal is amazing. Definitely has been a favorite for years.
June 24, 2015|Riverside Lunch|5|I had a great meal dining al-fresco by the water with two colleagues. We really enjoyed the patio seating, some great lunch choices and fantastic service. This remains one of Providence's best restaurants, even if it doesn't get the notoriety of some of the others.
June 19, 2015|Elegagant Evening|5|Can't speak measures enough of the job both Sean and Stephanie did to make my girlfriend's evening a memorable one. From stellar spot on accommodations for dairy allergies, to the warmth of dining in an elegant atmosphere, yet feeling like your at a friend's residence. The food has a picturesque presentation that as appealing to the eye, as it is to your palate. Looking forward to spending my next special occasion here!
June 19, 2015|Great Seafood|4|My wife and I Had a halibut special , it was a very generous portion and extremely tasty. Oyster were excellent and the deserts are works of art. We had a great time.
June 13, 2015|Remarkable!|5|That one word describes the very apparent and amazing organizational skill of all who work at Cafe Nuovo in addition to the fantastic food, perfect table service, and a warm, welcoming ambiance!!
June 11, 2015|Excellent Restaurant in every way|5|Went here for my daughter's post-graduation lunch. Excellent service, wine, entrées and desserts. Couldn't be more pleased.
June 10, 2015|Fabulous food|5|Cafe Nuovo has fabulous food. The taste and the presentation are always top notch. The beet salad was delicious, the tuna amazing and the chocolate cake sinful. Each dish is a work of art.

This was my first time visiting Cafe Nuovo for dinner and it exceeded my expectations. The wait staff was amazing and their service was second to none. I can't wait to go back for dinner, again.
May 23, 2015|Everything was outstanding!|5|The staff and the food could not have been better. This was one of the all time bests.
May 23, 2015|excellent experience|4|"Although a bit pricey, Cafe Nuovo was an excellent dining adventure. Plates are well-presented, well-cooked creations of ""usual"" products in inventive dishes. The desserts and their plating were the particular standouts. Although coming from a european experience, I found the desserts a bit sweet for my new tastes, they were all delicious and artistically plated. Service staff are all pleasant and extremely attentive. I look forward to the next time."
May 19, 2015|Business dinner impressed|5|For a foodie, the menu was varied and not status quo. The flavors were vibrant, presentation was great, staff was attentive, and vibe was perfect.
May 17, 2015|Great service and amazing food!|5|Went here for a graduation dinner. They were able to seat us early! The food was delicious and the customer service was perfect.
May 10, 2015|Consistently top notch|5|My wife and I have been here a few times and it is a wonderful experience every time. The tomato soup, made with some grilled corn in it, is outrageously good, we get it as our appetizer every time. We have had the beef dishes, which were delicious. On our last visit I had the beef tenderloin risotto and it was very, very good; our grown son had it also and raved about it. This has become one of our favorite places to go for a special occasion or just to have a great meal, in a relaxing atmosphere. The service is very attentive, but not intrusive and the bar knows how to make a great mixed drink.
May 9, 2015|Firs time and won't be the last|4|Great food!!! Great Service!!!! Great wait staff!!!! Nothing I can say except this was a great night out. From the Apps to dessert everything was delicious and FRESH!!!!! Highly recommend.
May 5, 2015|The food and service were Excellent|5|We went there with a small group for my son's birthday and we were very impressed with the food and especially the service. We are from out of town and did not know the place(just selected it based on Opentable reviews) but will definitely be back.
May 2, 2015|Best of the Best|5|Cafe Nuovo is in my opinion the very BEST restaurant in Providence, RI. It offers an eclectic menu with some of the best food I have ever had. Cafe Nuovo should be listed in the top 10 restaurants in America. Great food, great wine list and absolutely top notch service.

April 24, 2015|Magnífica experiencia|4|Después de leer algunas muy buenas críticas sobre este restaurante, fui con unos amigos con los que visitaba Providence. No hay queja alguna. Superó nuestras expectativas. No hubo un solo platillo que no fuera sobresaliente: el chowder, el hallibut, los raviolis, los postres. Incluso, el vino recomendado por el mesero fue de una gran calidad en relación con el precio. El servicio fue muy bueno: atento, resolvió nuestras dudas, estuvo al pendiente de nuestras necesidades sin estar encima de nosotros todo el tiempo. El timing, entre platillo y platillo, fue casi perfecto. Una gran experiencia gastronómica en Providence. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.
April 24, 2015|Pleasant Surprise!|4|In the lqst 2 months I have been 3 times to Cafe Nuovo and have not been disappointed. Last week, I went to celebrate a friend 90th birthday, and we commented how beautiful the colored sugar looked on the table. At the end of the meal, the waitress presented us with the bill and a box full of the colored sugar. We were delighted and very pleased. I will recommend Cafe Nuovo to all my friends.
April 24, 2015|Had a great meal right up until the expe...|3|Had a great meal right up until the experience was ruined by the rude parking attendant. The restaurant is fabulous but unfortunately they don't have their own parking during the daytime. There were plenty of parking spaces available and I had to send out a contract before leaving the parking lot and the parking attendant rudely pushed me out the lot! unless they get their own parking, I won't be back. I don't need to be hassled by an hourly employee after what I spent on lunch and then the $6.00 to park for an hour.
April 18, 2015|Painter|5|Party of six seated at water view. Food was excellent, service was great. Special occasion restaurant. A very rewarding experience.
April 18, 2015|Always a good meal and fantastic service.|5|Overall great place! From the amazing food and presentation, to the fantastic service, I have never had a bad time at Cafe Nuevo. The stuffed rigatoni is a must, and it is unlike anything you have ever had before. Great drink and wine selection! Also ample self parking and free valet make this downtown spot very accomidating.
April 18, 2015|Great food, terrific service and great o...|4|Great food, terrific service and great overall experience. Our server Amber was very informative and new the details and all the dishes we had inquired about.
April 17, 2015|Excellent overall!! We were celebrating ...|5|Excellent overall!! We were celebrating our anniversary so they gave us a table by the water. The waitress was very attentive without being obtrusive and her suggestion for the wine was excellent. The food was exceptional!! We will definitely be back again!!
April 10, 2015|Romantic evening|5|I wanted to treat my wife to a special night out to let her know how I much I truly love and appreciate her. I had never been to Café Nuevo. The food, the service, the ambiance, the view, the valet parking, and easy access all made the night a very rewarding experience. I highly recommend it.
March 11, 2015|Always a great place to eat|5|The Nuovo is highly recommended, especially if you are out for a business dinner or a romantic evening. The staff is excellent and attentive, and the food is outstanding. Great wine list and the specials really are interesting treats. Great selection of deserts. I have been going there on a regular basis and will continue my patronage.
March 9, 2015|servers that forgot orders and didn't co...|3|servers that forgot orders and didn't come back to the table for hours at a time..... despite that fact that only 2 other tables had guests? Crying baby at the next table? It's apparently the gourmet version of Howard Johnson's
March 4, 2015|2nd Visit|4|This was our 2nd visit in the last 45 days and the food was just as good as our 1st visit. The crab cake appetizer was delicious. One special entree with scallops and risotto was very good and the 2nd with Faroe Island salmon was great. Really like the fact that parking is easy and inexpensive compared to comparable restaurants in Boston.
February 28, 2015|very good kitchen, slightly formal atmosphere|4|We split the crab cakes and a salad for appetizers. Crab cakes were very good, if not quite the best we have had, but we would order them again. Organic green salad had marcona almonds and a flavorful light dressing - nice. Our mains were beef short rib and the shrimp and scallops. Beef had excellent flavor, but was slightly dried out. Still a strong B+. Shrimp and scallops were superb. The only distinctly inferior item that appeared on the table was the bread. A restaurant of this calibre should have excellent bread. Service was a bit chaotic, though they were very busy on a Saturday night. Slightly more formal atmosphere than some of the competition nearby.
February 20, 2015|All points fine!|5|The mood was romantic and the feeling you received was that the Chef was preparing an avant garde preparation just for us. Waiter was just 'cool' and helped make the experience very special. And the mood even at the bar was easy, accepting and yet chic. The complimentary valet made it SO EASY to come in even in the center of a busy city.
February 14, 2015|Great service|4|Our waiter Ted was one of the best servers I've ever had. Incredible service in a beautiful scenic spot
February 14, 2015|OUTSTANDING!!!|5|I was so impressed with the quality of service, the menu options, wine list and the presentation of the meals. The food was outstanding, both main course and desert. Our service was best in class and very friendly. I will be going back for seconds and more...thank you for a great experience.
Dined on February 13, 2015|Valentine's Dinner|5|"My wife and I have been to Cafe Nuovo several times, and we have always enjoyed the food and the service. So, when I was looking for somewhere to take her for Valentine's Day it was a natural. We arrived right on time for our 6pm reservation, and after checking our coats, we we led to a table with a nice view of the open kitchen. Our servers were very attentive. The service was efficient, without being overbearing. The food was delicious, from the appetizer to the salad and the entrees. My only regret was that we didn't save room for dessert. Cafe Nuovo is one of my ""go to"" places for a special occasion."
February 13, 2015|Will return!|5|Comfortable ambiance, friendly staff, creative menu, delicious food (the crispy tuna sushi appetizer was especially good) fair price, impeccable service, valet parking. Will definitely return!
February 12, 2015|Great specials. Fabulous view. Excellent...|5|Great specials. Fabulous view. Excellent server. Nolan knew everything, was well spoken and was very kind.
February 6, 2015|Always Great|5|The food and service here is always first class. I love this Resturant.
February 6, 2015|Good value. Excellent service and food.|5|Crabcake appetizer was delicious. We tried the Cajun dusted shrimp & scallop and seared tuna and both were commendable. We ordered the snowflake Sundae for dessert and it was perfectly sized for two to share. We are planning to return. Bountiful and inexpensive parking offers a bonus over the similar fare in Boston.
February 5, 2015|Fabulous meal Thursday with husband and friends.|5|Had the best salmon dish ever (Faroe Islands salmon). The bread pudding dessert was outstanding also. Our waiter, Vince is a true professional.
February 4, 2015|Service extraordinaire|5|Our lunch sitting by the windows affording a wonderful view of Downcity Providence even in winter was enhanced by the excellent service by our server Ken who was attentive but not intrusive.
January 31, 2015|New chef|5|Since the arrival of the new chef, there has been a noticeable positive change. Inventiveness and creativity have returned to their offerings, and the execution has been flawless. This restaurant had always been known for pushing at the edges of contemporary dining, but seemed to have settled into a dormant cycle for a year or two. Looking forward to see how things evolve.
January 31, 2015|"Good restaurant, ""bar"" doesn't do it"|4|This is a terrific Providence restaurant with wonderful food and even better service (thanks, Ken, you really know your craft). The only shortfall is the bar which is really another seating area for dinner. We went early hoping to have a drink before dinner but when we went to sit down at two open seats we were told they were reserved for diners. That's fine but please make that clear on your website.
January 21, 2015|Very much prestigious|5|Went for restaurant week. Great short ribs with mashed and Brussels sprouts and her lemon sole was good. apps were excellent and the dessert as well. Main menu looks expensive but worth a try parking was a breeze for a city restaurant with free valet.
January 17, 2015|Nice restaurant, excellent waiter but on...|3|Nice restaurant, excellent waiter but once they knew we were on the price fixe offer, it was a rush to get us out the door. No bread at the start-took the dishes away. Gave us the bill the same time they gave us desert. If we go back, it will be for the regular menu. Perhaps the pace will be slower then.
January 17, 2015|Always solid, a favorite!|5|Party of 5 for a Restaurant Week dinner. Everything was great! What more can I say.
January 13, 2015|Another  Impeccable Experience|5|Cafe Nuovo is always fantastic yet tonight was an evening filled with phenomenal taste, exquisite presentation, and of course, impeccable service!!!
January 6, 2015|Best Meal in Providence|5|Hands down, this is the best meal I've ever enjoyed in PVD. I ordered the Shrimp + Scallops ( cajun-dusted, spaghetti squash, pancetta, overnight tomatoes, sweet corn + chive butter). YUM. Our waiter, Ken, was extremely attentive and we enjoyed his sense of humor. I can't wait to come back.
January 3, 2015|4 Year Anniversary|5|We had our first dining experience with Cafe Nuovo last year on New Year's Eve (our anniversary) and we were blown away by the incredible service for such a busy night. This year we made our reservation a few days after New Year's and it was just as wonderful. We actually sat at the same table as the prior year. The table was great, it was past the bar in the back left corner of the restaurant. We were right next to a window overlooking the river. Our server was absolutely fantastic. I forgot his name, but his menu knowledge and recommendations were right on point. He was very astute and professional, without coming off as boring or stuffy. Altogether a great place for an evening out. Thanks Cafe Nuovo
December 29, 2014|Kind of a let down|3|Our server was great but everything else was equal to a Chelos or Greggs. The drinks were poorly mixed, mine was nearly straight whiskey. The vegetables on both plates looked and tasted like they came from the garbage. I had expected a better experience due to the reputation but this was a big let down and it cost me $250 for just the 2 of us with no bottle of wine. There are many better restaurants in Providence - I would pass this one up.
December 27, 2014|Cafe Nuevo|5|We just love Cafe Nuevo. It never disappoints. Have been coming here for our anniversary for years...and other special celebrations. Great food preparations...novel, fresh, beautifully presented.
December 22, 2014|Christmas Lunch|4|It would seem that extra tables had been added to accommodate the various office parties and holiday crowd. Food was absolutely superb, and the ine list offered a succulent 2004 Aloxe-Corton burgundy that matched well. The wait staff is truly a group of professionals, who express personality as well as efficient table service. This is one of Providence's finest restaurants. If only it were less noisy!
December 20, 2014|Excellent as always! Lobster was giganti...|5|Excellent as always! Lobster was gigantic, way larger then the advertised 2 lbs.
December 18, 2014|Elegant atmosphere. Service was average....|4|Elegant atmosphere. Service was average. Presentation of food was nice. Food was good.
December 10, 2014|LOVE  this place!|5|"Been going for 15 years -- consistently wonderful. Save room for the pot of mousse -- easily the most beautiful dessert you'll ever find and delicious. For a high-end restaurant, I like that they have some ""composed plates"" rather than just a la carte. AND they allow substitutions for the sides that come with those plates. LOVE this place!"
December 6, 2014|It was our first time at Cafe Nuovo an t...|4|It was our first time at Cafe Nuovo an the food was fantastic. The menu had a great selection of choices for our group and everyone one enjoyed. The only reason i gave the service 3 stars was although our waitress was prompt and courteous she didn't seem like she wanted to be there that evening.
December 2, 2014|Consistently outstanding!|5|Cafe Nuovo continues to provide consistently great food & great service ensuring a wonderful evening. Great for personal dining and business entertaining. Highly recommend.
November 29, 2014|Best Spot in Providence|5|This was my second visit to Cafe Nuovo and I love it more every time I go. Beef rissoto to die for, fantastic white sangria and an amazing mousse cup for dessert. The view of the canal and downtown Providence is beautiful! Very tasteful decorations during this holiday season as well. I am beyond impressed with this place, owing a restaurant myself that means a lot!
November 28, 2014|Always a great evening|5|As always, the staff and food are perfect. BBQ Chicken pizza and short rib were perfect. Get up and go.
November 28, 2014|Never Fails!|5|Had another awesome dinner here with a few good friends. Great selection of food which never disappoints! The stuffed rigatoni was amazing and my wife's special shrimp pasta entree looked and tastes fantastic. Awesome service. Awesome food.
November 28, 2014|Cafe Nuovo|4|I have always wanted to try Cafe Nuovo, and am glad I finally did. The restaurant is in a great location; located in the city center of Providence, and overlooks the river (it was just a short walk from our hotel, and I was glad we did not have to deal with the car). The atmosphere was lovely, and we sat in an area that was a bit more private, just off the main dining room. The food was superb! I had an excellent mixed greens salad with a maple walnut vinaigrette, followed by Ahi Tuna, and an amazing brownie sundae for dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal/evening at Cafe Nuovo, and will be returning in the future.
November 15, 2014|New chef, new menu|5|Seems there's a new face in the kitchen and OMG how delicious is the food? Great meal last weekend.
November 12, 2014|Cafe N|4|Cafe Nuovo has wonderful ambience and a well-trained friendly staff! The food was excellent and our server, Lisa, made several excellent suggestions while being very flexible in making small adjustments to our selections! This restaurant is a WINNER!!
November 12, 2014|Fantastic!!!!|5|A friend and I had lunch here recently to catch up. The experience was just fantastic overall. The restaurant is very elegant and has a great view of the river in Providence. Our server was very helpful and efficient. The food was wonderful. We shared a wedge salad and I had a scallop and pesto linguine special and my friend had the shrimp tacos. We both thought both dishes were delicious. We spent 2 hours eating and talking and we were not rushed in the least. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and I will definitely be back again.
November 11, 2014|Outstanding as usual!|5|Café Nuovo is a place I keep coming back to. The food has never been anything other than outstanding and the service is impeccable. Risotto, steak, sides...I always love whatever I order. Love sitting outside along the river in the summer.
November 6, 2014|Very nice spot in Providence!!!|4|The service was outstanding in this very lovely restaurant! Food choices were plentiful and everyone in our party really enjoyed their dish! I would highly recommend next time when you are in Providence!
November 4, 2014|excellent|5|the tuna was fantastic. as was the eggplant medley. service was excellent too
November 4, 2014|A Providence Gem|5|One of the outstanding characteristics is a menu that is varied and yet the chef executes perfectly on every dish. To begin with seating was prompt and courteous. Our wait person was quick to introduce himself, and despite being a bit over burderned with tables made sure we were not neglected. We were three people that night, and enjoyed great pasta and fish. One of us had a special Bolegnese dish that was outstanding. Too full for dessert which was a shame as they all looked very good.
November 3, 2014|Great food and service|5|Excellent service as well as food quality. The desserts not only have good taste but also very attractive looking. The restaurant is not very large, so you may need to reserved well ahead of time for a group. Perfect location for date nights.
October 31, 2014|Great Service, Great Food|4|"Was very happy to see ""The Chopped Salad"" back on the menu! The service was fantastic. ( Thank you Ken for that!) The food was great. We had a very enjoyable evening."
October 31, 2014|perfect business lunch|4|We were catered to in a perfectly inconspicuous way, food delightful, view, open warm, subtle. Just what I was looking for.
October 25, 2014|New chef onboard|5|There is a new chef in charge of the kitchen, and the effect has been positive so far. Interesting to see how the menu changes as time goes on.
October 25, 2014|Excellent meal|5|We had a dinner for 6 people on recent Saturday night with a Waterfire celebration. Though the restaurant was crowded, the noise level was low enough for us to have a reasonable conversation over a several course meal. We ate a broad range of dishes, lamb shank, swordfish, duck, and lobster pasta. All the meals were excellent, as were the salads and desserts. Our server Ted was knowledgeable and helpful.
October 21, 2014|They treated us so well|5|We had a large group (12) with a baby and they took great care of us. he food is outstanding and the place is beautiful. I will return for a romantic dinner for two.
Dined on October 17, 2014|Sure to please|5|We love cafe nuovo! We recently celebrated our anniversary there . Escargot , veal stuffed rigatoni, veal scallopini were excellent. Their desserts are all wonderful and a work of art.
October 10, 2014|Perfect if you have all afternoon|4|I loved the food and ambiance sitting outside, but it took over an HOUR to get food. Not good when this was a business lunch. Messed up my schedule and could have been disastrous had my guests both not had afternoon meetings that happened to cancel.
October 9, 2014|Fabulous Lunch|4|I went to lunch with a friend at Café Nuovo on 10/09/14 and I have to say everything was fantastic. We had a lovely seat by the window (as requested) and our server was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Risotto with Tenderloin. It was absolutely delicious. The tenderloin was very tender, the risotto was very flavorful and the portion size was perfect for lunch. My friend had the tomato soup and a Caesar salad and he was very happy with his selection. I will definitely be going back to Café Nuovo for dinner. I would highly recommend the restaurant.
October 8, 2014|Wnonderful evening!|4|The food was very good, the ambiance was outstanding and the service second to none. The drinks were a generous pour. Overall just a relaxing and satisfying evening! Andrew
October 7, 2014|Great Evening|5|"Café Nuovo made our 36th wedding anniversary celebration very special. We appreciated the restaurant's table arrangement of a semi-circle of candles around the red rosas that I had ordered for the table. The food was superb. We especially enjoyed the pizza special as an appetizer (outstanding). Our entrées were equally of high caliber. We are also grateful for the dessert of ice cream with its platter of ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate. The restaurant contributed significantly to making that evening (October 7) a very memorable one. We will certainly continue to return to Café Nuovo. Thank you."
October 4, 2014|Great place|5|We have enjoyed cafe novo many times for celebrations and special events. We have never been disappointed.
September 27, 2014|Special Celebration|5|The ambiance, service, and meal were outstanding as always. Celebrating a colleague's retirement at Cafe Nuovo made it very special with impeccable service that never made us feel that we were being rushed through the evening. The Veal Scalapine was tender and delicious. The table service of the Sole was very impressive and cooked perfectly. Being able to view the Providence Water Fire only enhanced the entire evening.
September 13, 2014|Grows with my 4 year old|4|Very good with my 4 year old. Made him a juice cup with tupper wear. No kids menus but made him pizza and offered to make just about anything for him. Food was outstanding. Nice place to eat with group of people and bring your child if no baby sitter available.
September 12, 2014|Solid But Not Memorable|3|We ate well...the Crispy Sushi was notable, shared the Bibb Salad, main courses of fish and beef and dessert. Everything was prepared to expectations, presented well, and our waitress was pleasant and helpful. We finished all the portions so there's no question about our enjoyment. In sum, satisfying.
September 6, 2014|The dinner was presented beautifully. Th...|4|The dinner was presented beautifully. The seafood portion size was very small 2 scallops and two shrimp. I'm glad it was me a petite person who ordered it or an additional snack would have been needed.
September 6, 2014|Awesome Dining Experience|5|The service and food were outstanding. Everything from valet parking, reception, bar, table, and server converged to make the entire dining experience exceptional. We will be back.......soon. The menu selections were diverse, appealing to a wide variety of pallets. Because of the driving, we had wine by the glass and the house recommendations were superb.
September 6, 2014|Excellent Service and Food|5|Visited here on a Saturday night. Started our meal with a 10 inch pizza of the day - which was thin crust - imaginative mix of toppings (no tomato sauce and mozzarella) and wonderfully crisp and tasty. Both entrées - a tortoloni dish and a bouillabaisse were also great.
September 5, 2014|Great anniversary dinner.  Beautiful vie...|5|Great anniversary dinner. Beautiful view on Waterfire route. Delicious. Our server was fantastic.
September 4, 2014|Outstanding Dinner|5|We have dined several times at Cafe Nuovo and have always experienced a top-tier evening. The ambience, food and service are all top-shelf. Valet parking makes it worry-free to drive into Providence.
August 30, 2014|Loved Cafe Nuovo!|5|We went to Cafe Nuovo to celebrate college graduations. We had 7:00 dinner reservations for outdoor seating. We were seated right away. Our waiter, John B., was excellent! He was attentive and always kept our wine glasses full. His suggestions for wine and food were perfect. All courses were nicely spaced out and not rushed. All meals were hot and prepared to perfection. I was not disappointed in anything at Cafe Nuovo. It might be pricey but you get what you pay for and it was worth every penny spent! I can't wait to go back again!
August 30, 2014|A fine dining experience|4|For a large and busy restaurant, our experiences here have always been on the higher level of a small, boutique establishment. We can even carry on conversations in a normal tone of voice. The service is as attentive as in smaller places, with well-trained staff. The food has always been delicious and carefully prepared. A measure of any restaurant's capability is risotto, and Nuovo always has three on the menu - and the ones I've enjoyed have been everything a risotto should be. My last dessert was a bit of a disappointment, but that's a minor quibble... and won't keep me from returning.
August 30, 2014|Always Great|5|I normally don't do reviews but I eat out often in the most highly rated restaurants and lately I have not been satisfied with many but we truly enjoyed a wonderful evening of fine dining this past Saturday with family so I thought Café Nuovo should get the kudos they deserve. As always the service and food were tremendous. The Crispy Sushi and Oysters were fresh and delicious, Duck Parpadelle, Lamb shank and Veal chop were superb. Cocktails to desert was a 10+. The restaurant was very busy but the service staff and kitchen did not miss a beat. I noticed the Host serving food and setting up to make sure everything was just right. Everyone there treats you very respectfully. Best restaurant in Rhode Island.
August 29, 2014|Wonderful dinner|5|My husband took me there for a birthday dinner. We will be back soon. The atmosphere, service and food was outstanding. The location is ideal.
August 28, 2014|Must Try!|5|Excellent food and service!! Outside dining area right along the river is very nice. Bar area a bit cramped but energetic and well stocked. I would definitely dine here again!!
August 25, 2014|Café Nuovo - great experience|5|Recently had a wonderful dinner at Café Nuovo in Providence, RI. It is always excellent there, so when we had family from out of town visiting, we wanted it to be sure to have a exceptional dining experience and it was. Great food, great view, wonderful experience. One of the best RI restaurants.
August 23, 2014|Slow service|2|We had a 6:30 reservation during the day of the Waterfire show. The restaurant was busy and it took almost 2 hours for the food to come. We had to rush through the food to catch the rest of the show. Food was good but we could've gone somewhere else if we knew service is this slow. If you want to catch the show, beware of the slow service if you don't get an outdoor seating.
August 23, 2014|Excellent food and service...|4|As usual the food and service were excellent, despite being packed by Water Fire and a private reception. Food service was probably a bit slower than usual, but we don't mind a leisurely meal. Wondering if the the restaurant could use some updating inside, decor seems tired and maybe a restroom renovation too? My husband and I were both in a line 6 people deep at one point :(
August 23, 2014|Great but not on a Waterfire night|4|We had a nice dinner, albeit with a few issues, but contribute that due to the incredibly busy night, because it was a Waterfire night. Ironically, we came here that night BECAUSE of it, however, it backfired because the kitchen was overwhelmed. For the cost we would have liked perfection. For example, my dish came out cold and my husband's special of the evening was overdone. I'm sure that they would have offered to redo it if he had complained more about it, (he mentioned it to our lovely waitress Charlene) but as it was we had waited well over an hour for our entrees to come out. Add that time to the almost half an hour for the salad to appear. The manger Sean, was so nice and offered to quickly reheat my entree, which I took him up on.
August 23, 2014|Wait staff marvelous - mgnt snooty|4|The food was delish - the wait staff was attentive but not intrusive - the management was snooty when I asked them for a window seat.
August 22, 2014|Favorite Al Fresco Spot|4|Cafe Nuovo is one of my absolute favorite warm weather restaurants in Providence. While I've never scored outdoor seating for Water Fire, it would be perfect 50-yard line seating. Even on a non-Water Fire night, the outdoor dining experience is the best. There is a Venice-like quality to the experience. Beyond the atmosphere, the food quality and service at Cafe Nuovo are always consistently very good. They have many creative options with interesting plating. They also have a wide selection of more simply grilled items for the less adventurous. Appetizers range from ocean fresh raw bar to a really good escargot and a solid duck confit pizza. Pasta dishes always have interesting twists on the traditional. Desserts are to die for.
August 16, 2014|great food - lovely location - not a tre...|4|great food - lovely location - not a trendy hot spot
August 15, 2014|Amazing food and service|5|I have not dined at Café Nuovo in quite sometime and I must admit it has been my loss. The food is amazing! I started with the crab & avocado appetizer special. The crab was luscious and sweet, I forced myself to share. My friend ordered the sushi appetizer which we would order again & again. Our entrees and desserts were equally delicious. One cannot dine at Café Nuovo without mentioning the topnotch service. Our waitress was attentive and offered wonderful suggestions (like the sushi). I look forward to another evening at Café Nuovo.
August 13, 2014|Business lunch|4|Very good spot for business lunch. Service was excellent and noise level low enough that we could have good conversation. Food was fine, not the focus, but that was okay for our purpose.
August 9, 2014|Pleasantly Surprised|5|With so many over-priced restaurants that promise more than they can ever deliver, it was refreshing to have a great dining experience with excellent food, very attentive service and a very relaxed atmosphere. Also the staff went out of their way to make accommodations for our children and their limited palates. Over-all great experience! Would highly recommend!
August 8, 2014|Great food great view and menu.|5|We sat outside on a beautiful night. The menu offers a great selection. We would recommend this restaurant.
August 7, 2014|Pricey but worth it|5|Really a gem of a place. Food is excellent, and out if the ordinary. Service couldn't be better. Just a little pricey. But if it's a special occasion, well worth the trip.
August 5, 2014|Consistency|5|Cafe Nuovo is simply the most consistent restaurant in the city with regard to menu, service, and quality.
August 4, 2014|Classy service, exceptional food, and ch...|5|Classy service, exceptional food, and charming canal front table- a winning combination.
July 26, 2014|Culinary Excellence!|5|This was the best service of any restaurant I have been to. Our server was so attentive, and very accommodating. The food, fresh presentation and the uniqueness of the combinations assembled was a pure culinary delight! The zucchni and eggplant tower was incredible. I would highly recommend this restuarant the next time you come to Providence. My only complaint would be there are too many tables in the restaurant, making it tough for the servers to navigate the room. The ambiance is hip, great views of the river, and a wonderful way to celebrate any special occassion! fabulous!
July 24, 2014|Amazing Experience|5|Found this spot on Yelp. It was a first class experience from beginning to end. The food was simply amazing in both taste and presentation. Not cheap, but well worth it.

July 18, 2014|Always outstanding|5|Dimitri and his staff consistantly have this place humming. The menu has a little something for everybody and the specials vary with every trip - always something interesting to enjoy. Don't skip the deserts. A must stop in Providence.
July 18, 2014|Another Excellent Experience|5|My second visit was also wonderful. The food, entertainment, service, ambience all created another memorable visit!
July 17, 2014|Restaurant Week 'Hit'|4|We needed to make one appearence at Providence Restaurant Week and chose Cafe Nuovo. All 5 in our party were very satisfied with all 5 stasrtes and entrees being very good to great. It was a nice night and sitting outside would have been nice, but we were fine where we were near the kitchen.
Dined on July 17, 2014|A bit much|3|This describes the style of this very traditional restaurant, as well as the food and the general tone of the place. The waitstaff was helpful but too eager to refill water glasses and rushed the service. Food lacked seasoning and imagination.
July 16, 2014|Always good food!|4|The food is always great at Cafe Nuovo. We had a great server with good suggestions for our dinner selections. It is in a corporate building so the atmosphere feels cold. But we like going when we are passing through Providence for a good meal.
July 16, 2014|great night out|5|Food was excellent! Went there for restaurant week. We had a 3 course meal.....I had the watermelon and arugula salad, the stuffed sole, and sorbet and fruit. Everything was delicious. Our waiter was excellent. Service was timely. Very, very good experience.
July 15, 2014|Doesn't disappoint|4|The cafe ambience even on a rainy sultry summer day was wonderful. Despite it being restaurant week in providence, the portions were very generous and artfully arranged as usual. . Sole on sticky rice with a beet reduction was splendid as well as sirloin tips. A watermelon arugula and feta salad was a refreshing lead in. Cheesecake and chocolate desserts were fine if unremarkable. All in all a great place to meet and eat!

July 14, 2014|Perfect!|5|I went to this restaurant for lunch and everything was perfect from start to finish. There is parking right out front. Both outdoors and indoors are beautiful. I decided on outside because it was so beautiful right on the river facing the gondolas. My friend was late, but I never felt uncomfortable waiting. The waiter was patient and accommodating and even helped me give her directions over the phone. When she finally arrived, we ordered and the food was so many good choices. The waiter helped me decide on a Bibb lettuce salad with grilled chicken. So good. My friend had a bowl of crab and mussel chowder. Delicious. They didn't mind that we sat there for three hours. It was so beautiful and elegant, yet very warm and welcoming.
July 12, 2014|Our favorite|5|Always consistent in quality of food. I have never been disappointed. Nice ambiance too.
July 11, 2014|Beautiful outdoor dining|5|Fine dining by the canal with the full moon and a great glass of wine...what more could you ask for.

July 11, 2014|Triple Crown Winner|5|Great food, fantastic ambience on the terrace and superior service.
July 10, 2014|Great Evening|5|Had a wonderful outside table along the river which set the mood for a great dinner. The service was impeccable and the food was top notch. Especially the warm oysters. Overall it was a great dining experience!
July 9, 2014|Five stars|5|Another wonderful dining experience at one of my favorite Providence restaurants.
July 9, 2014|Great View|3|The restaurant did not seem very busy even though it was restaurant week but the service was very slow. I ordered seafood salad and Lemon Sole both were just OK. I can cook better. Neither came with lemon wedges that I seem to have problems getting with my seafood in RI. I asked for them twice and by the time they arrived my food was barely warm. I may eat there again but only because it was nice sitting outside with a view of the river and my fiends food looked better than mine. Also, it is in a convenient location although a bit hard to find. I will not order seafood.
July 9, 2014|Excellent|5|Restaurant Week - Real entree's on the selected menu. Not just a pasta dishes to be participating in Restaurant Week. Service is always outstanding! Beautiful night for outdoor dining as well.
July 8, 2014|Would come back|4|The food was above average and the service was outstanding. The restaurant week menu was a great value as normal prices at the restaurant are quite high (especially considering the abundance of options in that area of Providence). Menu had a atypical vegetarian options which allowed one member of our party to have a more exciting meal than is regularly available to her when dining out. Would return during restaurant week.
July 7, 2014|Cafe Nuovo|5|Great food and service, the best escargot, dessert was served with a candle and Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate
July 7, 2014|six star experience|5|Cafe Nuovo makes Providence proud! The food is beyond belief, the setting gorgeous and the staff at the top of their game.
July 5, 2014|A fine dining experience|5|Cafe Nuovo was a fabulous dining experience. The staff, food, presentation, wine list and ambience make for a feast for the senses! We enjoyed our evening from the moment we walked through the door until we were warmly wished a good evening. This is a. Use for anyone who is looking for a superb meal.
June 28, 2014|Great food|4|We celebrated my Mother-in-Law's 75th Birthday. There were 12 of us. The food was excellent and overall experience was perfect. Sit outside to see Waterfire up close and personal. We go into Boston regularly for great food but will def be coming here more often. One of the best we've tried in RI. Thanks!
June 21, 2014|Sitting by the rivet|5|Watching the gondolas go by eating great food drinking great wine what could be bad on a beautiful summer night? Great service too!
June 20, 2014|Loved it!|5|Two bottles of wine, vrab cakes 3 ways, mussel and scallop chowder, then entrees; scallops with risotto and a special of the day, turkey on focaccia. Everything was just wonderful. Beautiful day to dine al fresco, unhurried by your fabulous waitstaff, right on the river. Perfect way for two sisters to catch up. We were there for almost three hours. It was perfect.
June 14, 2014|Consistently Excellent!|5|Cafe Nuovo remains consistently excellent in quality of food, presentation, and service. It is always a pleasure to dine there.
June 13, 2014|Excellent!!|5|This place is Outstanding!! My favorite place to eat in Prov.!!!
June 11, 2014|Good food great location|5|This is my second time to Cafe Nuovo. Dinner is consistently good.On a nice evening or for water fire outdoor dinning overlooking the Providence river . Make reservations early for nights of waterfire.
May 31, 2014|Slow Service|3|The food was delicious but a little bit on the salty side. The unfortunate part to the evening was the extremely slow service. There was a private party being catered and it appeared that all the staff and food was going there first. Our first course came quickly with bread and olives half way through but then it was another hour before our meal came and only once did the wait staff return to ask if we wanted another cocktail. No comment or apology in between regarding the major delay. Disappointing.
May 24, 2014|The food was amazing, but the service wa...|4|The food was amazing, but the service was very, very bad. We went over graduation weekend, which probably explains this. There was a huge party, and they served the party first, completely ignoring their guests. We were seated 45 minutes past our reservation time. That said, I would definitely go back on a less busy weekend!
May 23, 2014|Wonderful experieince|5|Highly recommend. Superb food, excellent wait staff.
May 23, 2014|noisy; mediocre food; good service|4|We had a wonderful time because we were with friends and were not rushed. However the food was mediocre (except the Moroccan Stew, which was excellent), and the room was so noisy we had difficulty hearing each other. Great service.
May 23, 2014|Good 4 adults @ college reunion|4|My husband and I were in town for our 20th college reunion and my mother's 45th reunion. We asked local friends for a recommendation and this was on the list. It was important for us to eat early. We took our tween daughters. We had a lovely meal and received very good service. The view of the river was nice. The adults in the group especially enjoyed the meal and experience.
May 23, 2014|Sean is the best!|5|Sean has always greeted me and my party with a great smile. He runs a great restaurant and the staff are excellent. Great place for lunch or a special event.
May 22, 2014|Thanks so much!|5|We enjoyed our meals tremendously and were very impressed with their flexibility and understanding. First class treatment!
May 17, 2014|Incredible!!|5|Impeccable wait staff, memorable food! Thanks for making our dinner there for our daughters graduation such a special occasion!!!

Before dinner drinks at the bar were great, they have Single Barrel Jack Daniels! Dinner was great all the way around and the staff folks were terrific. I'll definitely be back for both business and pleasure.
May 12, 2014|Excellent service, great food|5|Our server, John, made the evening extraordinary. He was attentive, without being overbearing. He was knowledgeable and clever. He was resourceful and charming. It was a windy evening, and John made sure that everything stayed in place. The food was exceptional and worth the price. Likewise, our wines were splendid. Aces all around.
May 12, 2014|Dining Al Fresco|5|Two out of town friends and I enjoyed a fabulous meal with very attentive, but not overbearing service recently. An unusually warm early May evening allowed us to enjoy eating outdoors. My friends were very impressed and you can be sure that all of us will return….soon!
May 12, 2014|wonderful|5|Took out of town company to dinner there, wanted to show them the river walk and a bit of Providence. While it did have good ratings, I did not anticipate how perfect it would be in every way. The food the service the setting. I had the lamb shank served over Orzo, but not just any orzo it was baked with a delicious San marzano tomato sauce I am still thinking about.
May 11, 2014|An Excellent Experience!|5|Cafe Nuovo hosted our group celebrating the conclusion of a year of service with each other. From beginning to end the experience at Cafe Nuovo was exceptional and first rate! From manner with which our party was greeted at the door, to the table we were escorted to, to course after course of wonderfully prepared starters and entrees, the staff at Cafe Nuovo knows how to treat its patrons in the highest degree. Their care and hospitality of our group made certain that experienced a memorable and highly enjoyable dining and culinary event that was a fitting exclamation point on our year together. Thank you!
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day|5|We took our mother there on Mother's Day for an early dinner. It was our first time there. Our waiter, Ken, was hilarious and attentive, and made my mother feel special. The food was great and the desserts were beautiful. Great time!
Dined on May 8, 2014|kteb|2|haven't been to cafe nuovo in a few years. had always been a good restaurant. tuna entree was bland, bibb salad good, drinks just ok. everything just ok - will not go back - there are too many restaurants in the city to settle for just ok
May 7, 2014|Hidden gem In the heart of downtown|5|This place is a great find! Hidden in the bottom of a bank building with excellent food, phenomenal staff and beautiful dining area. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left they were amazing. Informative, tentative without being annoying, accommodating to special requests. All around the experience was fantastic!
May 3, 2014|Awesome meal|5|Best restaurant I've been to in a while! Chef and waiter were so accommodating of my allergies - even modified some dishes for me. Highlights were the escargot and the duck breast pappardelle. Both amazing! Will absolutely make the trek to Providence just for this restaurant.
May 3, 2014|Best dinner in some time|5|Really nice place, central location, great staff, 10 of 10, thats not even talking about the food. The food was top of the hill. Even liked the slight attitude from the bartender, verry French. This was for my wife on her birthday, really made he day! Highly recommended. PS, try the choc pot dessert.
May 3, 2014|Cafe Nuovo|5|this was our fourth time to this restaurant in the last two years. The service and food and atmosphere makes this spot one of our favorites.
April 28, 2014|A perfect celebration|4|Monday night, group of 11 celebrating a special occasion. We received a private room by the window, right next to the canal. The staff was extremely attentive and professional, and guided us to some delicious specials including a melt-in-your-mouth bursts with prosciutto appetizer and a swordfish with a rhubarb glaze for dinner. Other notable dishes included a juicy and tender duck breast, a seared tuna, and a baked salmon. The private room was separated enough to allow for normal conversation, even though it was a big table. And, as finishing touch, the valet had our cars ready and waiting as we were leaving the restaurant. We would definitely go back the next time we are in town.
April 26, 2014|A Great Find|5|We were in Providence for a cycling race and picked Cafe Nuovo for a family dinner Saturday night. We could not have been happier. Excellent food all around. Great recommendations from our waiter who also got one of the biggest % tips I leave!
April 26, 2014|Cafe Nuovo 4|4|Our 4th visit from Massachusetts.......... Food was overall very good. Appeertizer (Eggplant) was average compared to Siena......... Service excellent
April 25, 2014|Always Excellent|5|We enjoyed utilizing the valet. Excellent reception at the door. Service from their waitstaff was knowledgeable, professional and i wanted for nothing. wine was ordered with dinner and they appeared regularly to maintain our glasses without request. warm towels with lemon were presented after our shellfish course. we enjoyed the taste and presentation of their plates right through to atmosphere and decor. The manager on duty came by personally to insure we enjoyed our dining experience. Ive been many times and am always excited to see menu changes, and taste my way through their small plates and entrees. Excellent spot to recommend.
April 24, 2014|Nice setting.|4|Very nice riverfront setting for a long lunch with old friends. Service was exceptional.
April 23, 2014|Service stands out|4|"Very professional service. Food was up to expectations but wines by the glass were not as inspired as the menu. Went midweek when it was quiet and our table was private, though the room layout is such that u could see how it could be noisier. Ambience was more ""upscale business"" than unique--seems like a place where people would take their clients out for dinner than a romantic spot."
April 19, 2014|A little off |3|N I always have a perfect experience so this time it was a little off. The staff seemed unhappy. We sat at the bar because our table was not ready waited for service there for first and second drink. Reservation was at 7. At 7:20 we were given a table in the main dining area. Very loud for me. I wear hearing aids. I need quiet. Our server was nice but didn't really speak to us. When we left no one at door and we got our own coats. Just didn't feel as special as when we usually go. What happened to the other maitre d?
April 19, 2014|New favorite restaurant in prov ri|5|This reservation was for my husbands birthday. I asked for a quiet table with a view because of his birthday. We were seated at exactly that!! The food was fantastic and the desserts were gorgeous! Never been before, very subtle location, we never even knew it was there. The wine was nice and the staff was very attentive. Would definitely go back and will tell everyone I know to go there. Don't mind spending $$$ if I enjoy the food/ atmosphere. This one is a keeper!!!
April 16, 2014|Excellent Service|4|"The service was excellent our waiter was fantastic, attentive, but let us have our space. Food was very good, but I expected to be ""wowed"" and was not-but still very good. Presentation of the Shrimp& Scallop dish was not appetizing at all, even though it had a nice flavor. Finally,wine list while adequate could use some enhanced choices. Overall, was good, Service absolutely over the Top and I would return again"
April 16, 2014|Business Dinner|5|We met one of our partners from out of town and the 3 of us had dinner at Cafe Nuovo Wednesday evening. Without going into lots of detail, everything from the appetizers, entrees, wine, and deserts were all wonderful. Last but not least was our waiter, he couldn't have been better. As always it was a great dining experience.

April 8, 2014|Cafe Nuovo A++|5|"My husband I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at Cafe Nuovo last night. Everything from the ambience, service, and food were outstanding. We arrived early and sat at the bar for a cocktail, and was had a delightful conversation with ""Jake"", who by the way also makes a perfectly delicious martini. It was a Tuesday night, and there weren't too many people there so it was a little quiet, but that helped with it being very romantic. The food is not only delicious and perfectly prepared, it is a work of art on a plate. I posted on Open Table that it was our anniversary and they appropriately gave us a beautiful table by the window, and when we ordered dessert, both plates had ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate! Bravo!"
April 5, 2014|We have been there a few times,|5|We have been there a few times, the food is always good, the wait staff very attentive to our needs and the sommelier has tremendous pairing suggestions.
April 5, 2014|Enjoyed Cafe Nuovo|5|Went to Cafe Nuovo to celebrate my wife's birthday and had a great experience. We had a very knowledgeable waitress who didn't rush us through meal, we had a very nice and relaxing meal. Even though it was a busy Saturday night the noise level was not too bad. The food was fantastic. This is a higher end restaurant that I would recommend for a special night out.
April 5, 2014|Birthday surprise|4|We have dined here before. Usually for special occasions. We had requested a table near the windows. When we arrived the restaurant was less than 30% full, but our request was not accommodated. Our table was at the rear of the restaurant. We ordered two salads. One was the bib and the other was the nightly special. Both were excellent. For dinner we ordered veal scaloppini and filet mignon. The veal was excellent. The filet was not cooked as requested. It took more than 10 minutes to get the plate back. I tried to wait to eat my food, but it was getting cool when the filet arrived back. We then ordered desserts. They were both excellent. The presentation was wonderfully creative.
March 31, 2014|We had six people and due|5|We had six people and due to the time of the week there were few people there. The food is excellent but considering the number of people we could have had more attentive service. Our waitress was professional, friendly and helpful with a very good grasp of the offerings. Small children would not be appropriate but well behaved ones would.
March 29, 2014|both great!|5|Cafe Nuovo is our go to spot for a special occasion. Food and service are consistently great! We love the menu, but the specials are always highly anticipated. Highly recommended!!!

March 29, 2014|We were working a show at|3|We were working a show at the convention center and in need of a good dining experience. The waiter was awesome! Recommended a great wine and was very attentive. Appetizer was excellent. Main course was a bit rich. Yes, I would return.
March 22, 2014|Friend's Night Out|5|Always have a great dinner when we are at Cafe Nuovo. Waite staff is very knowledgable and attentive. Enjoyed my evening beginning to end..
March 15, 2014|The food was AMAZING. I had|5|The food was AMAZING. I had the scallops and shrimp dish with butternut squash spaghetti. I never knew there was such a thing!! Excited to go back!
March 15, 2014|Just as great as I remember!|5|I have not been to Cafe Nuovo in quite a few years. I loved it when I was there before and was not disappointed this time either! The food was delicious, the presentation was beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly and gracious. Both my date and I enjoyed it thouroughly. We will be back!
March 11, 2014|Excellent as Always!|5|Once again I had a great meal with colleagues at Café Nuovo. Their seasonal menu has a wide range of choices that are expertly prepared and served by a wait staff that is second to none. Consistently outstanding in all categories.
March 8, 2014|I selected this venue based|5|I selected this venue based on other reviews and I was not disappointed! The service was the best I have had in years. The food was thoughtful and inventive. From coat check to chef to wait staff to owner, there is not a staff more in tune to its clients than Café Nuovo. Put it on your list to visit soon and often.
March 7, 2014|We will be back|5|This was my second time at the restaurant and both have been very good. I was there with my wife and enjoyed the complete experience from oyster appetizers to after dinner drinks. We will be back again soon.
March 4, 2014|Probably my fourth trip to|4|Probably my fourth trip to this restaurant over the same number of years. Food and service has always been consistently good. Had two meals off the nightly specials this time and both were excellent. Can't wait to return.
February 22, 2014|Mini Vacation|5|Everyone has an extremely busy schedule these days and its hard to find the time to simply enjoy a few hours away from the grind. Cafe Nuovo offers anyone that chance to sit in a beautiful and relaxing environment that caters to you. The menu is excellent and they offer delicious specials. The staff is well verse and honestly care about your experience. Management is kind and friendly and remember well the highlights of previous visits and add that personal touch when you don't expect it. The calamari was fresh and golden brown, my filet was the perfect temp and a nice portion. This is a wonderful setting with a five star meal, it's the perfect mini vacation for all of us who live in Providence and nearby. I highly recommend a visit.
February 22, 2014|Favorite in Providence|5|I love everything about this restaurant, the only very, very, very slight issue was the overly touchy service; still better then abandonment;)
February 20, 2014|Excellent food and great service|5|My wife took me out for my 40th b-day what a treat. Everything that we ordered from appetizer to dessert was excellent. This is my new favorite place!
February 15, 2014|Never disappointed|4|This is the third time at this restaurant. The food is always excellent. The service is second to none. Will be back soon.
February 14, 2014|great place to go|5|Amazing food . the crispy sushi is to die for . amazing service . I will be back!
February 14, 2014|Average|4|My wife and I have had a few meals at Cafe Nuovo. We have always been very pleased with the quality of the service and exceptional food. However we where disappointed with the overall atmosphere and service on Valentines day. In general I believe they had jeopardized their reputation by giving in to pressure and over booking. This made the dining experience somewhat rushed and took away the atmosphere my wife and I loved about the Cafe. We will be back because the food is great and have never been disappointed but on a slow night.
February 14, 2014|The food is incredible and|5|The food is incredible and the staff is very professional and knowledgeable. I would definately recommend Cafe Nuovo to friends. I love eating here.
February 14, 2014|Great food even when slammed!|4|We go to Cafe Nuovo a few times a year, and decided to go for Valentine's Day--which landed on Friday. Every table was booked, and still the food was great. I had the tortelloni and my BF had the halibut. As always, the servers were friendly and very professional. The presenation of food is really unequaled in Prov--each dish looks like a work of art. Kudos for pulling off your usual standards even on Valentine's Day Cafe Nuovo! I can wait for spring and the patio....;-)
February 14, 2014|My amazing valentines day.|4|Outstanding service, excellent food, very romantic, my beautiful, perfect, sweet, kind, funny, sexy, incredible date was VERY impressed.
Dined on February 14, 2014|Spectacular|5|Cafe Nuovo was a successful reservation. The service was amazing from time of arrival until we stepped into our vehicle. It was a great experience. The food was absolutely delicious. There New York steak strip was my option for dinner while my wife choose the veal. I was very very satisfied. Customer service was awesome. I would deff give Cafe Nuovo a future visit.
February 12, 2014|Always top notch|5|Café Nuovo is THE place to go for a special night or just for great food with friends. Dimitri Kriticos is always paying attention to every detail of the dining experience. The service is great - the staff is not only knowledgeable about the menu selections - they know where the dishes key ingredients are sourced and when asked - they can recommend great wines to pair with anything on the menu. When looking for a great place to dine in downtown Providence - don't miss this place.
February 8, 2014|Great night out!|5|Food and service were exceptional, dining room feels a little crowded as tables are close together and the space itself seems small for the amount of tables/chairs they put in there. However the professional staff skillfully navigated around the busy dining room, everyone was very polite and friendly, the foot was artfully designed and plated and executed perfectly. Perfect place for a special occasion, Definitely a must-try restaurant in providence.
February 8, 2014|That special night out.|5|As always a phenomenal experience. The appetizer, salad and entree were fantastic. Dessert was good but not exceptional like the rest of the meal. Our waiter was fantastic. He was knowledgeable , attentive and had a great personality and sense of humor.
February 4, 2014|Pleasant surprise|5|Haven't been in a while because the old menu was tired. New menu was awesome & food equally as impressive. Will surely return soon.
February 1, 2014|Elizabeth's Birthday|4|I went to Café Nuovo for my birthday with my friends. We wanted to get dressed up and go somewhere fancy. We had a really good time. The food was good and my mom had called to have some desserts sent over to the table. Everyone was really nice, they sang to me and brought all kinds of fancy deserts to the table. I would definitely go back. Thanks Elizabeth Bennett
February 1, 2014|Favorite restaurant!|5|Everything about this place is 5 star worthy. Service, decor, view all contribute to experiece. This was our 3rd visit and just like past times food was outstanding. From the appetizer tomain course all were prepared using fresh and high quality ingredients. Everyone in my group loved their meals. My salmon was the best I have ever had. And just when we thought it could not get any better our dessert came. So artfully prepared and scrumptious. The chef. Even wrote happy birthday and inserted a candle on the side of the plate. It is the little touches like this that and the consistently great food and service that will keep us going back despite the hour drive to Prov. l
January 28, 2014|Amazing Choice|5|Everything from the appetizers to the desserts were well planned out, uniquely paired, and beautifully presented while staying true to familiar tastes that play delightfully with twists from the kitchen.
January 27, 2014|Great experience|5|My husband and I returned to Cafe Nuovo after 5 years. The restaurant was as wonderful as it had been many years ago. The food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. Our waitress, Amber, was great! Very attentive, knowledgeable, and had a great personality. I am looking forward to going back!
January 25, 2014|I'll be back!|5|Excellent food, beautifully presented, friendly and accommodating service, pricey, but not outrageous, free valet parking -- everything a good restaurant should aspire to! I'll definitely be back, despite the fact that this restaurant is a 90 minute drive from my home! If I was looking for a complaint, it would be that the tables are a little tight, but for us it just added to the fun to compare menu choices and reviews with our fellow diners!
January 25, 2014|We went to Cafe Nuovo at the|5|We went to Cafe Nuovo at the suggestion of a friend and because it was part of Providence's Restaurant Week. Everything was wonderful! The service was impeccable - our server was friendly, helpful, efficient, and very patient as we waited for one of our guests to arrive. The food was delicious, most notably the Cajun chicken soup and the sorbet and fruit dessert! I look forward to going to back in the warm weather to dine outside!
January 24, 2014|Outstanding as always!|5|Best restaurant in Providence! As always, it was outstanding in every way!
January 23, 2014|Overrated|2|The lemon sole was tough and dry. Needless to say this was disappointing.
January 18, 2014|Above the din|4|Noise level on Saturday night is deafening. But food is wonderful. Would go back, but not on a Saturday
January 18, 2014|Great Birthday Dinner|5|I celebrated my birthday with my family last Saturday evening at Cafe Nuovo. It was wonderful. Great food and our waitress Michele P was the best. I highly recommend Cafe Nuovo.
January 18, 2014|Excellent meal, great food|4|Was overall happy with the food and theme I. A very nice place for a great meal. I was a bit unhappy with the ending, we had dessert but the server never asked if we wanted coffee. It seems small but after dropping that amount of money it ended on a sour note. Asked somebody else about some coffee and they said ask the server. Besides that it is an excellent place to spend a evening with fine food and scenic views of Providence.
January 15, 2014|Great choice for Restaurant Week|4|A group of us chose Cafe Nuovo for providence restaurant week because of it's wide selection for te restaurant week menu. We were all impressed and agreed it was one of the best choices for providence restaurant week and will definitely be back!
January 15, 2014|Our dining experience was|5|Our dining experience was wonderful from beginning to end. Our appetizers, dinners and desserts were plated beautifully and each course was delicious. You can't find a better risotto dish anywhere in Rhode Island!
January 13, 2014|Well established|5|Well established, still plating food that tastes and looks wonderful! The service was timely, informative and was there at the right times. Spot on!
January 11, 2014|Fine Upscale Dining on the River|4|One of the best Providence restaurants, this restaurant offers fine dining in a gracious atmosphere. Perfect for special family occasions, the selection will easily handle all tastes. The Restaurant Week menu is an exceptional bargain, as the prices are a bit steep.
January 7, 2014|A Great Alternative to Federal Hill|4|Unlike so many restaurants on Federal Hill Cafe Nuovo delivers with really tasty food great atmosphere and sophisticated takes on each dish. We have been here several times and it never fails to deliver a satisfying experience. We enjoyed the dover sole and pasta with lobster, both of which, were very enjoyable. The cocktails and wine list are sure to satisfy almost everyone. The only negative was I noticed a significant uptick in the pricing of menu items. Its not cheap, but neither is a great experience.
January 7, 2014|Continues to Impress|5|Every time I go to Cafe Nuovo, I walk away more impressed. Took a client for lunch this week and as usual the service was impeccable and the food outstanding. I strongly recommend the Scallop and Mussel Chowder - just terrific. I also had the Risotto Sea Scallops which was delicious. My client had Cream of Tomato Soup and an open face grilled cheese and tuna and said both were great.
January 6, 2014|Great dinner as usual|5|We went to Cafe Nuovo for my husband's birthday, and as usual it did not disappoint. The food was delicious and our server Ted was excellet. He truly made it a special night for us. We can't wait to come back.
January 4, 2014|Wow!!! Cafe Nuovo is PERFECTION!!!|5|Outstanding on every level...Cafe Nuovo, a gem!!! Make this your next dining experience, you will be pleased to perfection!!! From the coat check lady to the owner...they go out of their way to create a memorable experience for you. Delicious food, unbelievable service, and a warm & cozy but, energetic vibe!!! Dimitri...you are doing it right!!! Your staff should be highly commended...thank you!!! Car service was an added plus... We totally appreciated it!!!
December 31, 2013|THE USUAL PERFECT DINING EXPERIENCE|5|"We were a party of 6 New Year's Eve and I have to say that every facet of our dining experience was fantastic. From drinks to appetizers, entrees and the fabulous desserts, nothing disappointed. Every dinner was cooked to perfection and served piping hot. This is why Cafe Nuovo is my ""go to"" for a great night out."
December 31, 2013|New Year's Eve|4|Had an early dinner here. Service was excellent. We weren't blown away by the food this time. It was good but not great.
December 28, 2013|Dinning with panache.|5|Great service,pleasant and cordial staff,warm atmosphere.I would definitely recommend.This was my second visit in the fall winter season for special occasions and the service was consistent.Thumbs up for excellent service.
December 28, 2013|Interesting, delectable menu|5|Creative menu. We all had different entrees - duck, short ribs, lamb and veal- all were outstanding! Delicious chowder! Great service. Valet parking convenient.
December 24, 2013|One of our favorite restaurants|5|One of our favorite restaurants in Providence. Food is always outstanding and the service is excellent. The only negative Cafe Nuovo has is they don't serve their red wines at the proper temperature. It won't stop us from going back but it's a bit of a bummer.
December 24, 2013|Nothing less than AMAZING!|5|From service to atmosphere an absolute 5 star! And the food.. Well.. One of the best dinners I've ever had! We will be back for all occasions!
December 19, 2013|Special Memories|5|We could not have chosen a better spot to celebrate our wedding day than Cafe Nuovo. None of us are from Rhode Island, but while wandering around checking out Providence I spotted this restaurant in the distance. I got online and saw the reviews and immediately made a reservation for lunch to follow our wedding ceremony. There were six of us dining and we had terrific service and even better food. Everyone was so warm when offering their congratulations. The food is beautifully plated and was some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. The cup of chicken & vegetable soup was a generous serving filled with chunks of chicken and veggies and the veal scaloppine melted in my mouth. And definitely save room for dessert.
December 18, 2013|Great Find in Providence!|5|Although the person at the front desk was not at his station for about 4 minutes after we walked in, we were taken to our table near the kitchen. So we started on a less than stellar note, but our service and food could not have been better. I would definitely return to this establishment. A superb dinner!
December 18, 2013|First bottle of wine was bad...sent|3|First bottle of wine was bad...sent back. seemed like the bottle was not stored properly. Warm. second bottle of differnt wine was fine. Food was good and serivce was good.
December 7, 2013|Great Special Occason|5|I took out of town guests there after seeing a show at PPAC. It couldn't have been a better ending to a wonderful day! The food was excellent and the wait staff was superb. It wasn't inexpensive, but the finer thngs in life usually cost a little more.
December 7, 2013|Outstanding Restaurant Experience|5|We were blown away by the restaurant, from the start to the finish in terms of service, food, drinks , ambiance and overall experience. Highly recommend. Everything was first class and first rate from the valet service to meal and service. Will definitely return.
November 23, 2013|Another Great Meal|5|My favorite restaurant in Providence. Great service, great food, great wine list!! In addition, Shawn's attentiveness is customers and their needs is amazing!
November 23, 2013|Great dining experience!!|5|We had a great experience at Cafe Nuovo. We went in and told the host that we were considering it as a location for a rehearsal dinner, and he promptly showed us all of our possible options and even gave us details about pricing and party size, etc. Our actual meal was incredible, and we both left saying that when we return, we would probably order the same dishes because they were so delicious! Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. We will definitely be back!
November 21, 2013|Pretty Much Perfect|5|I've been here for lunch a number of times as I have a client down the street. I can absolutely always count on a great experience. Creative menu, delicious food, impeccable service.
November 16, 2013|Excellent time|5|We met friends for dinner last Saturday night. The food was superb! The place was lively. The waiter was so knowlegable about the food, loved his role and genuinely enhanced our time out that evening. great place!
November 15, 2013|Spectacular|5|I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary and it was simply wonderful
Dined on November 9, 2013|A really bad experience!|1|The worse of all was how we were greeted when checking in. When I dared to ask for a table by the window, I was told in a very nasty way that tables by the window were given according to availability. We were seated second row from the window and for the entire dinner, the window table in front of us stayed empty. The food was average with spices covering the taste of the main ingredients. Truly disappointing!
November 9, 2013|The food is unbelievable!|5|The food is unbelievable! Oysters were delicious and fresh. Tuna and lamb were excellent and cooked perfectly. Our server was very knowledgable on both food and drink menus. Unfortunately we live out of town or this would be our go to restaurant. If back in Providence, we will definitely return!
November 8, 2013|Cafe Nouvo|5|Great meal everytime we have dined there... excellent service.. .great location.. outdoor seating in summer AL FRESCO.. atmosphere very enjoyable each time.
November 8, 2013|Cafe Nuovo is perfect again|5|This is our favorite special occasion restaurant in Providence. They have been serving outstanding food for years and years and they never disappoint.
November 2, 2013|My husband pronounced his|5|My husband pronounced his filet mignon as the best he had EVER had!
October 28, 2013|Top Choice for Providence|5|Cafe Nuovo is an understated name for such a fantastic restaurant. Outside seating along the canal is noteworthy as the gondoliers guide the authentic Italian Gondolas along side the tables which is a nice view from inside as well. The food is even more outstanding then the view and covers a broad enough range to tantalize the palates of a large group. My favorites have been seafood cannelloni and the steak tar tare appetizer. The cocktails are amazing and so is the service.
October 25, 2013|Excellent Dining Experience|5|We arrived 30 minutes before our reservation and were seated immediately. Began with a Caesar salad and a wonderful special of greens, pecans, cranberries with a light spicy dressing. Ordered the Beef Tenderloin over risotto, a shrimp and couscous special and salmon for main entrees....flavors were wonderful and the proteins were cooked to perfection. Finished with Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding and a tasty pumpkin creme brûlée served in its shell. This was a birthday celebration and the server was attentive without being overbearing. The brûlée was brought to the table decorated with our birthday girl's name and a candle. Three hours went by in a blink. We never felt rushed and the dining experience was one of the best we've had.
October 22, 2013|Awesome experience|5|Went here to celebrate a birthday and loved it!! Service was very friendly and the food was phenomenal! Pricey but well worth it :)
October 18, 2013|Thank you|5|We were treated very well, with excellent service. The menu was well thought out. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. The wine list was fine and we will explore it more the next time we dine there. We observed a number of dishes that we would like to try, including a beet appitizer that was so beautifully presented that I had thought it was a dessert until our server told us what it was. It was an excellent experience.
October 18, 2013|Perfect ending to a perfect day|5|My husband and I had a rare occasion to spend a few hours with our daughter while visiting her at college. We wanted to take her and her roommate somewhere special. Cafe Nuovo was just the perfect place. Our college students appreciated and enjoyed the fine food; there was something for everyone's tastes. Service was superb and the atmosphere was also relaxing where we are actually able to hear the conversation. The reviews were spot on. We will be back.
October 12, 2013|Recommend for Smaller Groups|4|"To be fair, I do have to say we had a party of (7) on a Water Fire evening. The food was great and the service friendly and attentive. The only negative about the restaurant was that you couldn't hear each other at the bar or at the table. The noise level when the restaurant is full is substantial. I had hoped to be able to really talk to everyone in the party, as I had gathered old friends to come in for the evening to help my husband and I celebrate our 22nd Anniversary. I could only converse with the two people on either side of me, which was disappointing. If you're looking for an 'intimate and relaxing' setting, this isn't the right place. Also, it would have been nice if our ""special"" occasion had been ""noted"", but wasn't."
October 12, 2013|Wonderful Birthday Dinner|5|We had a wonderful evening. Our table was a perfect view for Waterfire. The food was exceptional and the menu diverse enough for all to enjoy. We particularly enjoyed the ambiance and the professional, cordial, attentive service we were given. Outstanding!
October 12, 2013|Great Restaurant!|5|Perfect location to eat at before seeing Waterfire. Staff, service, and food were excellent. Don't miss the beautiful, artistic desserts.
October 9, 2013|new favorite!|5|Each bite was better than the last. The only thing that could have improved was if the bread was warm. Otherwise, everything we ate was fabulous. The atmosphere was great and the service was also excellent. I have been here for a girls night and a romantic dinner with my husband. I highly recommend. When I was there wiyh the girls it was crowded and noisy but when I was with my husband it was quiet and very romantic.
October 5, 2013|Great food and service. Would|4|Great food and service. Would have loved option of reserving outside table when booking online but that did not seem to be an option.
September 28, 2013|Great for special occasions|4|Very good food and the service was great. Was a very busy Waterfire Providence evening. They moved tables quickly and provided wonderful service
September 27, 2013|Expected More|4|Café Nuovo was a recommendation from a friend. At first glance the menu came across as eclectic and enticing. The wine list was expansive and unexpected albeit a little pricy for Providence. We arrived and were cordially greeted by name based on our reservation time and seated in a large yet cramped main room. The ambiance was acceptable with soft lighting and what I assume was a nice view of the riverwalk (I couldn't tell as we were seated in the direct center of the room). The menu had been very well written - almost too well as we felt the cuisine did not live up to the artful descriptions. Overall I would rate the experience as a 7 out of 10 but we did enjoy it and would give it another try. The service itself was excellent.
September 27, 2013|Menu special|5|The duck confit over fettuccine special was superb....
September 26, 2013|A nice find|5|Very enjoyable, terrific service and nice location on the canals so you can walk your dinner off a bit. Very nice veal chop and a desert of chocolate to die for. Never rushed, comfortable atmosphere. I would definitely put it on my short list for special occasions.
September 25, 2013|Business dinner|5|Mid week so it was fairly quiet. Excellent service. Bartender attentive. Waitress was excellent. Knew the wine list well. Recommendations were great. Food was excellent. Complex and interesting meal preparations. Plan to bring my wife for a romantic getaway. Highly recommended.
September 20, 2013|Accommodating|5|One of our guests had dietary limitations. The hostess and chef were great on meeting those needs without sacrificing the course.
September 14, 2013|Age Unfriendly|2|My wife and I visited for the first time and while the food was outstanding the service was not and we both felt age discriminated against. The waiter did not offer us the night’s specials, ask if we were interested in wine or bother with us other than to bring the food and bill. Other wait staff conversed with their tables and offered specials but ours was disinterested with us. The host went to all of the tables surrounding us and asked how dinner was and made small talk. He looked at us & walked away. It was obvious that we were the youngest in the crowd, but the level of service was uncalled for. Unfortunately we will not revisit until we are at least in our mid to late 40's as it is apparent that this is the crowd they are looking for.
September 14, 2013|Delicious...Will definitely return|5|I was hopeful that Café Nuovo would live up to the great reviews online and it did. I arrived earlier than my reservation with my teenage daughters and my husband and was promptly seated outside with a view of the canal. Our server was very professional and knowledgable about the menu, listing every ingredient used in the specials. I started with the tomato soup. It was by far the most delicious tomato soup I've ever tried. A bit of creaminess, but not too creamy. Chunky with tomatoes and corn and just the right amount of spice. I tried the halibut special. It had the most delicious sauce, not too heavy, but very flavorful. It was served over asparagus, tiny chunks of butternut squash and tiny red potatoes. Would absolutely return.
September 14, 2013|Providence's first|5|My wife and I made Cafe Nuovo the first place we ate in Providence and have now set the bar very high for each restaurant at which we eat while on vacation. Halibut was exceptionally prepared, and desserts were winners, fig tart and strawberry dessert. The culinary artists posing as chefs do things we don't usually see at fine restaurants, they use multiples more of different tastes to create their dishes. The only thing I am sure of is you won't be disappointed.
September 11, 2013|EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS!|5|I have been to Café Nuovo several times and have NEVER been disappointed. The food is always top notch. It is especially nice for a special occasion.
August 30, 2013|Everything was amazing, the|5|Everything was amazing, the food was innovative and delicious, service was outstanding, overall wonderful dining experience. Sat outside on the patio overlooking water, wonderful view of the gondola rides.
August 28, 2013|Great place for lunch!|5|I've always thought of Cafe Nuovo just as a dinner spot but have learned that lunch here is fantastic. Shrimp tacos were delicious. If its a nice day, dining on the patio is a must.
August 26, 2013|Over rated|2|The fish I had was overcooked; it tasted like sawdust. The fries were actually black. Who let them even leave the kitchen? Sandwich was on a grocery store bun with about a teaspoon of sauce on one side. The best part was a slaw, but there wasn't much of that.
August 20, 2013|Great Cuisine at a Reasonable Price|5|We had a terrific business dinner with great service and great food for a reasonable price- highly recommended.
August 17, 2013|Super Spot|5|We had a five-star evening .. now favorite outdoor spot here in Providence
August 17, 2013|Amazing|5|I could not believe how good my meal at Cafe Nuovo was. Risotto is the best I've had at a restaurant, with scallops practically the size of a fist. My wife got the halibut special and could not believe how well cooked her fish was. That's another great thing about Nuovo - there are always a handful of amazing specials. We've been here 4 times and each time the menu has gotten more interesting, with more emphasis on fresh, local seafood and produce.
August 16, 2013|Purely fine dining|5|We went to Cafe Nuovo on a Saturday night. The service couldn't have been better. When we arrived, the host immediately said that I had requested outside seating. Our server Rick was excellent. He had a full command of the wine menu and described the specials in such detail that I couldn't wait to order. The food was beautifully prepared and delicious. There is nothing worse than going out to dinner and feeling like it is an inconvenience. This was a great experience.
August 13, 2013|Gourment Cuisiine with a River View|5|On my second trip, I satisfied my curiosity with the steak tartar with truffles appetizer which was the highlight of our meal. The taste was incredible. If you are daring to do a tartar, this is the place to get it. The taste, seasonings, and texture are amazing.
August 12, 2013|Enjoyable Night|5|Had another fantastic meal while enjoying a beautiful summer night outside along the canal. Amazing wine suggested by Shawn combined with wonderful food will always keep us coming back. My favorite restaurant in Providence and our go to restaurant for special occasions
August 12, 2013|Another Decent Place|4|So, we were there for a business dinner. Waiting at the bar for everyone to arrive drinks. Jake the bartender was great, knowledgeable, and quick to serve really good drinks. We were seated quickly with a really nice view outside. The appetizer and the soup were very good and the only complaint I had about the food was that my Swordfish was a bit overdone.
August 10, 2013|Water Fire find|5|Going to Cafe Nuovo during Water Fire was great. Not only was the food, service and location outstanding having parking made getting there easy. We parked, enjoyed the event and then had a wonderful meal. Will plan on returning next time we are in Providence
August 10, 2013|Met all our expectations|4|We made a reservation for an evening at a Waterfire event. We ate inside and had a view of the river. We had the baked salmon composed plate and the veal scallopini Both of us loved our dinners. The wait staff was very accommodating
August 10, 2013|Excellent food, service, location|5|Perfect location before or during Waterfire. Food was fantastic- large portions and great quality. Sat at the bar and service was great- bartenders were knowledgeable of menu and were attentive even when it got busy in restaurant and they had to fulfill orders from the tables.
August 10, 2013|Excellent evening|4|Artfully presented food, attentive service, and attractive surroundings made for an excellent evening. On a Waterfire evening, there is no better place to be than on their outdoor terrace overlooking the fires and gondolas.
August 9, 2013|R.I. spot|4|This restaurant was recommended by locals. They were right. Great food and location.
Dined on August 8, 2013|RI romance|3|"The outdoor dining was our choice and it was an unpretentious American ""Paris"". Food was very good and the surroundings made you feel like you were on a vacation."
August 8, 2013|Great cuisine along the river|5|"Cafe Nuovo is a classy little spot along the river in downtown in a office building on the ground level. Valet parking and a white tablecloth interior with a long elegant bar with lots of after work regulars. The menu is just as the name suggests ""Nuevo"". Seafood, great steaks, Italian dishes and great daily. My daughter had the filet, my husband the sirloin special and I had the scallop lemon risotto. The scallops were of the sea variety seared, about medium sized and there were 8 of them. Perfectly cooked. The lemon risotto was creamy and lightly lemoned. Perfect. We did start with escargot in a creamy garlic sauce that was out of this world. The atmosphere is classy...you won't be disappointed!"
August 7, 2013|Our favorite|5|We have dinner at Café Nuovo at least 3 - 4 times a year for special occasions and we have never been disappointed in food, wine, service and ambiance. Definitely our favorite restaurant in Providence
August 5, 2013|It was a Monday, so not much of a|5|crowd. Our waiter enthusuatically went over the specials. Great wine list, and the entrees were cooked to perfection. I'll be back
August 3, 2013|So like a pair of comfortable shoes|4|"By Gucci. In the interest of proper disclosure, I'll admit that we've dined here very frequently, so they know us - but there are other places we go almost as often that don't expend the effort to get to know their customers. If you want to rate a restaurant based on the way they ""take care of their regulars"", then you have to give Nuovo a thumbs-up. This is not a quality that can be turned on and off. Good service for good customers requires good people - and good people are good without regard to their familiarity with the patron they happen to be taking care of at any given moment, so the newcomer gets the benefit of being in a place that has better staff and management that emphasizes service. That's why we keep going back."
August 3, 2013|We took wanted to take my|5|We took wanted to take my parents out for a really nice evening and remembered that we had been to Cafe Nuovo almost 20 years ago. When we first were seated, I was a little concerned about how many tables and how close together they were in the dining room. I thought perhaps we were going to be hurried through our meal. I was very mistaken. Our server was wonderful and ensured that we had a long and very enjoyable evening. All of our meals were great - from the Watermelon Carpaccio salad (who'd-of thought you could do that to watermelon?) to the Sea Scallop Risotto to the incredible pot of Mousse dessert!
August 3, 2013|Sitting outside along the|5|Sitting outside along the canal was a fantastic way for us and our out-of-town guests to enjoy the wonderful view while dining on freshly-made apps, pasta, and pizza. Everything was superb. Even when it started raining, sitting under the umbrella was a great treat and we were well taken care of. Only downside was service took a little long - it took about 45 minutes before we received any food, and we were hungry.
August 3, 2013|Excellent|5|Excellent food, good service and a great dining outside next to the canal and gondolas
August 2, 2013|Great anniversary dining experience|5|54th anniv. Ambiance, service, food and experience were outstanding. Rick, our waiter, was exceptional. Highly recommend.
July 22, 2013|Always Great|5|Café Nuovo continues to be excellent - the food and service are always superb. It is our first choice when we have out-of-town guests or clients visit.
July 20, 2013|Best restaurant in Providence!|5|This is our absolute favorite restaurant in Providence! Food and service are consistently outstanding! Great ambiance! There is a great patio outside where you can eat with a view of the river. Servers and staff are very friendly. We have tried so many other restaurants in Providence and none can beat this one!
July 20, 2013|Dining Delight - still superb|5|An excellent dining experience from the food to the service ..
July 20, 2013|Excellent food, excellent service|4|This restaurant was beautiful with excellent food and exemplary service. The decor is relaxing and chic, and comfortable. They also have outdoor seating right by the river where you can watch the gondolas go by. Overall, wonderful experience.
July 18, 2013|A Classic Experience|5|Cafe Nuovo continues to be our favorite restaurant of all time!! The food is one of a kind from taste to presentation. There is always room for dessert no matter how full you may be! We often choose to eat outdoors by the river, water fire evenings add even more to the setting. The wait staff caters to your every need and is always willing to give their advice if you have a question.
July 17, 2013|Another wonderful experience|5|Another wonderful experience at one of my favorite restaurants. Great food, excellent service in a beautiful ambience.
July 17, 2013|Providence Restaurants Week|4|Wanted to go to Cafe Nuovo for special Restaurant week menu. Service was excellent. Waitress was very attentive and personable. Menu had plenty of options for 3 course meal. Sat inside due to the high temperatures outside but was somewhat disappointed with table...especially since we had made reservation thru Open Table...we felt as though we were barely in the main dining room...with view of outside door. We were 3 women in our party...not sure if a gentleman had been with us if we would have gotten the same seating.
July 13, 2013|Wonderful Surprise|5|We reserved what we hoped would be an outside table for 6 during Waterfires. Arriving, we didn't think there was any chance we would get an outside table as inside it was packed but they had indeed held a table for us outdoors. Never having been here, we were nervous that just like on a typical Valentine's Day or Mother's Day, the food might be unimpressive and the service lackluster. Instead, we had one of the best meals of our lives and the service was as striking as the views. Save room for the sumptuous deserts. Prices much less than what we expected. You will pay more for a steak at Ruth's Chris that cannot compare to the filets we had at Cafe Nuovo. Such a wonderful surprise that the evening turned out even better than expected.
July 13, 2013|A Perfect Dinner|5|What could be better than dining outside on a beautiful summer evening with your true love? We celebrated 30 years of marriage dining on the patio by the waterfire. For appetizers I had a Greek salad. My husband had the shrimp and calamari . Both were tasty. The halibut was juicy and tender. My husband ordered the filet mignon that came with asparagus and a German potato salad. Perfect! We shared both our entrees. We ordered desserts off the regular dessert menu. Again, we shared and both desserts were beautifully presented. My husband had the dreamy pot of mousse which had white chocolate, dark chocolate and a cappuccino flavor. I had the key lime dessert.The crust was of shortbread and the key lime was just the right tanginess.
July 11, 2013|Great Food|4|Went for my anniversary and was seated right away. The service was very good, not to much if you know what i mean. The only thing was I felt one of the tables next to us was just to close and my privacy was just not there. Other then this a great night.
July 11, 2013|Restaurant week|5|I went for restaurant week with family, when they offered a 3 course meal for $30. Well worth the price tag. I will be back next restaurant week for sure, if not sooner.
July 11, 2013|Restaurant Week Must Go|5|Tomato soup with corn was wonderful! Desserts are beautiful and tasty too. Outdoor dining was so much fun.
July 10, 2013|Food and service arevery good.|4|This is a restaurant in Providence that you can have a nice evening in a comfortable setting. Reservations are honored and the food and service are very good. We are always happy when we eat at Cafe Nuovo.
July 9, 2013|One of RI's Best|5|Just love Cafe Nuovo. Ample drinks, delicious food, great atmosphere, especially on a summer night outdoors. We had tomato soup (amazing) , mushroom risotto w/ beef, chicken piccata, and mousse for dessert (also amazing). Service was terrific. We'll be back.
July 8, 2013|Great Dining Experience|5|We were visiting family in Cranston and it was our first visit to Café Nuovo. We had the most enjoyable dinner: the food was fabulous with beautiful presentation and our wait staff were professional and very efficient. It was a great way to top off our vacation. Will definitely plan to revisit if back in the Providence area again.
July 6, 2013|We love this place|5|We had a wonderful time. The service was great. The food was delicious.
July 5, 2013|Outstanding Food!|5|The food was outstanding. The presentation was enough to surprise me, but the taste of everything we ordered was top notch. The Stuffed Rigatoni was by far, one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. The Duck Breast was cooked to perfection and extremely tender and tasty. The appetizer special was a Barbecue Pork Pizza and if it weren't for the anticipation of my entree, I would have eaten the entire thing myself. We topped it all off with a couple of Lattes and a Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar with Cappuccino Ice Cream. They have outdoor seating that is perfect for a Waterfire night. And Valet parking. Was all in all, a great dining experience.
July 5, 2013|dining experience worth the trip|5|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The waiter was knowledgeable and the service impeccable. Our waiter recommend a new wine we had not previously tried and it was perfect. He was careful to explore our likes and dislikes before making a recommendation. The food was fabulous and it works for both the adventurous and not so adventurous. They have a grill menu that you can pair with your own sides and then they have composite menu with the chefs recommendations. We had crab cakes which were absolutely fresh and home made delicious. My husband had sea bass and I had duck both delightful with blends of flavor. For desert, the double chocolate mousse is a must. It comes in a chocolate box with two kinds of mousse, white and dark.
July 3, 2013|beautiful ambiance|5|outstanding food...everything from the salads to the soups to the entrees. all cooked to perfection, all creatively presented. wait staff was attentive and pleasant. elegant outside dining. comfortable for just appetizers or full course meal. romantic atmosphere but also family friendly. third time here and would return again and again.
June 27, 2013|II doubt there is a better|5|II doubt there is a better place for an up-scale lunch in Providence (or Boston).
June 22, 2013|Still in awe!|5|Shrimp and scallop dish with spaghetti squash was incredible. Be sure to wash it down with a dessert, highly recommend pot of mousse.
June 22, 2013|A great elegant retreat|5|Cafe nuovo has never failed to dissapoint me whenever I come. I brought my boyfriend here for the first time and he absolutely loved the outside view. The atmosphere was very refined and sophisticated, a great escape from the normal day to day routine. Our waiter was very friendly and was quite accomadating. We enjoyed desert the best the plating was astounding and the taste was incredible. We both tried the snickerdoodle latè that was absolutely out of this world. No doubt I will return again to this lovely place.
June 22, 2013|AWFUL ATTITUDE|1|"I took someone from out of town & wanted it to be a special meal. He is a foodie and appreciates good food. I thought Cafe Nuovo would be a great choice. I've dined here previously and have had good meals. Saturday night was not a good experience. We ordered medium steaks which came out overcooked. We sent them back. New steaks were cooked medium, but the manager came out & said that the original steaks were ""actually cooked right & that we must have thought they were over cooked because of poor lighting"". We were insulted & felt there was absolutely no reason for him to say what he did. I chewed the steak! It had NOTHING to do with the lighting! Not sure what his point was but it was rude & uncalled for in a upscale restaurant."
June 21, 2013|Wonderful time|4|Last minute trip to Providence, random pick off opentable. Great food, great service! I couldn't be more please, highly recommended.
June 20, 2013|This was a father's day date|5|This was a father's day date with my daughter. She came up from Martha's Vineyard and I drove down from Worcester. I selected Cafe Nuovo on a recommendation of a friend and we couldn't have been more pleased. I need not wait for a special occasion to return.
June 15, 2013|Wonderful outdoor dining|5|This was our first time visiting and it was a wonderful experience. Great food, positive staff, and beautiful outdoor seating that highlighted the beauty of Providence. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
June 15, 2013|one of the best|5|we stumbled on this by accident on a 2 day stay in Providence, RI. We were amazed by the quality of the food. We have a reasonably hight level of food sophistication I think and this place blew us away. We ate 2 nights in succession it was so good. The chef is a master - appetizers, main courses, desserts. The outside seating along the river is charming and the waiters and staff were wonderful. Over the two nights we had the salmon, veal, roasted chicken and tuna main dishes and all were flawless and quality repeatable between the 2 nights. Desserts were creative and rich, not overly sweet - just the right balance. Recommend this at the highest level. A real find.
June 15, 2013|Was an anniversary dinner.|5|Was an anniversary dinner. Very attentive but not obtrusive waiter. Outstanding food. Reasonable pricing for fine dining.
June 8, 2013|Surprise Birthday Dinner|5|This was a surprise birthday dinner The staff was very attentive, thank you for. Wonderful meal and a great experience
June 8, 2013|Nice dinner|3|Nice place, located right next to the water, patio seating and next to the Gondola landing. The crowd was a mix of couples, groups and families. For an appetizer we got the calamari and shrimp! It was delicious. I ordered the lamb shank and my husband ordered the seared tuna...we both enjoyed our meals. I hope to return to try their risotto as I saw many other diners ordering it, it must be good!!

Dined on June 7, 2013|Fantastic!!!|5|My wife and I went to Café Nuovo for our fifth anniversary. Everything was wonderful. The experience here was by far the highlight of our evening. While this was easily the most I have ever spent on a meal, it was also by far the best we have ever had.
May 31, 2013|average|3|We have been before.....and so the bar was set high. Food & Service fell a little short......We have no problem paying....but when you are paying $40 for an entree....they have to deliver on the Food & Service...every time...every guest....every plate. Tuna was not Sushi Grade....(tendons are not ok). Some of the Bread was tough and cold. Short Ribs Special was great.......Polenta was excellent. Sea Bass was ok (lacking flavor).........Service was ok. Nice server....but a little slow.....clearly we were just a #.....and Service was nothing special. She did rattle off the specials with percision.....and I appreciate that. We'll be back......but this was not Nuovo's best night. -Duck
May 31, 2013|Energetic|4|Came here with my husband on a weekend trip to Providence. Restaurant was extremely busy and noisy (graduation season?) but the food was quite good and we really enjoyed our oysters on the half shell and lobster fettuccine and striped bass specials. Despite the crowds, service was very good and we never felt we were waiting too long. Location was excellent, right next to the river, and we took a nice walk and saw Water Fire after dinner.
May 31, 2013|Creative, delicious food|4|Cafe Nuovo was truly a surprise.the restaurant is on the ground floor of a newish office tower on the riverfront in Providence. We were able to sit outside since our reservation was on the early side (it filled up quickly). I ordered the tomato soup and the stuffed rigatoni. Both were all new revelations of classic recipes. The soup had chunks of corn, and a curry-like spice (but not curry)) that my wife and I still cannot place. In particular, the stuffed rigatoni, which is presented bundled and standing on end on the plate, was rich, meaty, and somehow creamy, too. This was truly one of the best dishes I have ever had, and is justified as a signature dish for the restaurant.
May 30, 2013|Great food and location|5|Took customers to Cafe Nuovo on a Thursday evening and had a terrific meal sitting outside by the canal. All 4 meals were great including a superb portion of Sea Bass, an exquisite mix of Cajun Shrimp and Scallops with maple syrup & butter accented summer squash, and a filling beef tenderloin and vegetable risotto. Cafe Nuovo has a strong wine list and desert menu although we were too full to order desert. It would be great to go back on an evening when the canal was having a Waterfire celebration.
May 29, 2013|Good but inflated|4|Food, atmosphere, and service were all very good. This is a fine restaurant and I knew it was going to be expensive to begin with. I feel you are paying more for the location and ambiance more than the food. I don't mind paying extra for that on occassion. The food is good, don't get me wrong, but I felt it was a little overpriced.
May 26, 2013|Great food and exceptional service!|4|We went with a large group to celebrate graduations and birthdays -- the food was delicious, and the service even better. We'd pre-ordered birthday desserts and all were spectacular -- the pastry chef is very talented -- and to top it off, each plate was adorned with a Happy Birthday wish (in chocolate) and a lit candle. All in all, a very memorable evening.
May 25, 2013|Loved Every Minute Of It!|5|My husband and I were in town for a reunion at Brown University. We took some time away from the campus to see water fire. Cafe Nuovo seemed liked a great spot to view water fire. While the location is wonderful - the service, food and ambiance were most notable. The owner even took time to introduce himself. Our server was lovely and gave a us a great tip about the gondola's rides that were available a few steps from the restaurants. The hostess was able to accommodate our request for a table by the window. The evening was capped off when the couple at the adjacent table got engaged. This was one of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. Just awesome!!
May 25, 2013|Too Busy for Customer Service|2|We arrived early for our reservation, but the restaurant was 37 minutes late seating us. We had to wait at the noisy, crowded bar for a total of nearly an hour. They were less than accomodating when it came to keeping us apprised about the wait. Numerous customers were quite unhappy. Granted, it was a busy Saturday evening for the first Waterfire event, but it took even longer than the wait to get seated to get our orders placed and the food to our table. Also, in my partner's dish, the shrimp was overcooked, and my sweet potatoe fries were soggy and seemed old and reheated at best. Given the high prices of the menu items, we would not have expected these culinary glitches. Quality and customer service were both sacrified at Cafe Nuovo.
May 24, 2013|Great place|4|Food was great, the server had deep knowledge of menu. I would recommend this place and the price isn't that expensive..
May 24, 2013|BEST NY SIRLOIN EVER|5|WE WILL BE BACK !!!!! VERY NICE ALL THE WAY AROUND THANKS FOR AWESOME SERVICE
May 24, 2013|Outstanding|5|This was one of the top restaurants I have ate at. The food was wonderful, the wine was wonderful, the dessert was wonderful! We were here for my son's Brown graduation, it was a perfect.
May 21, 2013|Fantastic!|5|Cafe Nuovo continues to offer one of the best dining experiences in Providence. Our food was prepared perfectly and was delicious and creative. Service and atmosphere were superb!
May 18, 2013|Great Spot|4|I would recommend overall a great place for food, ambience and friendly staff.
May 17, 2013|Sugar overload!|2|The pastry chef should go back to culinary school. You do not put tons of sugar in desserts to the point of making people throw up: I am not a pastry chef but I at least know that. Worn out dinner menus and cheap celestial tea did not provide what I call a fine dining experience. Bottom line: for dessert (perhaps for food too as what we have seen on others' plates looked pedestrian at best), avoid at all cost aka if you have diabetes you will not have a pleasant time!

May 4, 2013|First time visiting this restaurant|5|This was the first time my husband and I visited this restaurant. We had a wonderful time! The food was delicious and the service was great. We did not even know this restaurant was here until one night we drove by and saw the sign. We have found our new spot!!!!
May 3, 2013|Terrific on all fronts|5|I had a swordfish special that was the best swordfish I've ever had. My husband had steak and said the same thing. The service was exceptional, the cocktails and wine perfect, and the entire evening was perfect.
April 27, 2013|"The ""almost"" best of all worlds"|4|"In Providence, one of the best places to get the entire dining experience. Great view for Waterfire, way-above-average food, and excellent service. There are restaurants which may outshine Nuovo on any one of these facets, but not all of them. This is the place to go for an ""evening out""."
April 27, 2013|Cafe Nuove Review by Ethelu|5|Went there twice in 2 weeks for special get togethers and it was excellent both times. Used the online reservation system and it worked perfectly. Lots of restaurants will only take reservations for large parties but there were only 3 of us on one occasion and a reservation for a Saturday night was no problems. Food, appetizers, dessert were all excellent.
April 26, 2013|Overrated|1|I was visiting Providence for the weekend and decided to try out Cafe Nuovo since they had such good reviews here. I don't think my expectations were too high, but I was at least expecting a good meal. Our server was very slow and unattentive and it took a very long time for her to order our drinks and food. They did not have a cocktail menu, so we ordered some standard drinks that any bartender should know - and they turned out awful. The food had good flavor but was extremely overcooked. I was just a bit shocked at how awful the experience was. I'm really not sure how this place has managed to get good reviews because it was very unimpressive.
April 22, 2013|Still Wonderful|5|Hadn't been in quite a while, but l wasn't disappointed. So glad to have a nice lunch with a friend. Will always love this restaurant!

April 6, 2013|I have not been here in over|4|I have not been here in over twelve years and it did not stand out in my mind back then. I have to say I was pleseantly surprised. The food was excellent, I would highly recommend the lamb shank. Everyone in my party of 4 was very pleased with their meals. The service was top notch, but not overbearing as can happen sometimes when servers try to be attentive they end up hovering. Overall, an excellent time and highly recommended.
April 4, 2013|Consistently Delicious|4|Whether you're attending a business luncheon or having a romantic dinner for two, Cafe Nuovo never fails to deliver. A creative menu, excellent preparation, and consistency are their calling cards. I have worked in that building for 15 years and have been fortunate enought to dine at Nuovo many, many times. I don't recall ever having a meal that was less than outstanding. Outdoor seating along the river is available when the weather permits. I highly recommend choosing this option!

March 23, 2013|Fantastic Dinner!!|5|My wife and I recently went to Cafe Nuovo to celebrate her birthday. We were seated at a table for two next to a window with a view of the river. The restaurant was very crowded, but we were able to converse without a problem. The service was outstanding. Vincent was extremely attentive, chose an excellent glass of red wine for me and gave some helpful direction on our choice of entrees. We started by sharing the beet salad. Fantastic! Light, yet rich with flavor. We both had entree specials, which were delicious. Dessert was an assortment of four flavors of sorbet, which were pleasing to the palate and refreshing. We had such a wonderful experience that we made reservations to go back the following week for dinner with our daughter.

I am a foodie, so I can be picky about everything. I can't offer even one negative to the food experience. But what was ""over the top"" was the service! The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and able to accommodate my dining companion's special requests with ease. I can't imagine adding to the experience by watching River Fire in season, but that would make it unimaginably great. We would recommend this restaurant on all counts."

I loved this entire dining experience, there was not one thing my date or I did not like (and usually there is something we find to be subpar while dining out). Competitive pricing that reflects the quality service and food. Definitely recommend and will definitely will return!
March 2, 2013|We love it here. The service|5|We love it here. The service is impeccable, the atmosphere is upscale but not obnoxious. Best of all the food is to die for. Beautiful presentation, good portions and an array of great appetizers and entrees to chose from. And did I mention the desserts? Besides delicious they are a work of art. Almost too beautiful to eat, but oh so scrumptious! Cafe Nuovo never disappoints, even on a busy Saturday night. By far our favorite resturant in Providence!

February 14, 2013|Went there for dinner 20 years|5|Went there for dinner 20 years ago, then moved to Colorado. Came back to the area for Valentine's Day and wanted to try it again. It was still just as amazing as it was 20 years ago. We own a seafood restaurant in Colorado and are very critical about what we eat. Cafe Nuovo lived up to all our expectations. I can't wait to go back again when I am in Rhode Island.
February 14, 2013|Nice Valentines dinner|4|Enjoyed a very nice Valentine's Day dinner. Would have preferred to be seated at an individual table rather then at the long booth with couples directly on each side of us but it's understandable on a bz nite. Good waiter but service was somewhat slow. That was ok though as we weren't in a rush and again, expected on Vday. Atmosphere is lovely, presentation of food is wonderful. Had the scallop and shrimp dish - good but maybe too much going on. Husband had swordfish and enjoyed that it was prepared as he had requested. Tried the dessert special which actually looked prettier than it tasted, if that makes sense. Next time would just go with one off the menu.

One problem was that once the dinner order was taken and entre served, no wait staff came by until I flagged one down after we were finished and waiting for 15 minutes or so. After we ordered dessert, the same thing happened again. No one came by to see how we were doing, nor clearing the table. The staff however, were very nice at every point. At the peak of the evening, although the restaurant was not full, it was very noisy.
February 6, 2013|This is my favorite restaurant|5|This is my favorite restaurant in Providence! I love the view and the food is amazing. The service is consistently fantastic and they always make you feel like you are the most important guest there!
February 2, 2013|Fanstastic restaurant!!|4|We went to Cafe Nuovo because we had been given a gift certificate over the holidays from our children and had been anxious to try the sister restaurant of Capriccio. It was definitely worth the trip. I recalled the location just overlooking the Providence River from WaterFire a couple of years ago and saw it was very busy. It has an amazing menu and the food is fantastic. Service is excellent--attentive, but not constant hovering that some waitstaff do in other restaurants. The waitress overheard a mention of my birthday and brought my dessert with a lit candle and beautifully decorated plate. She was also helpful and gave me extra olives ( the wonderful huge red Cerignola from the Puglia region of Italy!) to take home.

For main courses, the salmon was thoughtful and well assembled and the scallops with risotto had an exciting depth of flavor with lime sauce. The desserts were also spectacular - peanutbutter/chocolate cake and lemon cheesecake. The service was fantastic, prompt, and helpful. Probably one of the best restaurants in Providence.

There was only one other couple in the restaurant, when our party of four arrived. We asked if we could have a table by the windows. They first tried to seat us at the back of the restaurant. For some reason we were seated right next to the only occupied table. Except for the seating arrangements, everything else about our dinner was excellent. The food and the service was outstanding as usual
December 28, 2012|Excellent dinner|5|We went for dinner w/another couple. Food, service and ambience were all excellent. Very nice but not overly stuffy or fancy. Hope to get back in the summer to be able to watch water fire. Highly recommend.
December 26, 2012|Delicious meal|5|This was my first visit to Cafe Nuovo. The appetizers were flavorful with great presentation. The wine list was extensive and the half bottle options allowed us to try both both red and white. I got the sea scallop risotto which was fabulous,flavorful, and cooked to perfection. My fiance had the tuna special and said the tuna was the best he had had in a long time. We were too full for desert but there were some wonderful treats on the menu I wish I could have tried. We were seated right next to the window and had the treat of watching the snow city, in the summer it would be perfect for waterfire. Our waitress was polite and attentive to the needs of the table. We would definitely return.
December 24, 2012|Christmas Eve Dinner|5|We chose Cafe Nuovo for Christmas Eve dinner, and it did not disappoint! Even though the restaurant was at full capacity, there was absolutely no loss of quality of food or service. Our waiter was cordial, attentive but not suffocating, and helpful. The food was perfectly prepared and presented. We have dined at Cafe Nuovo over the years, and it is one of those rare restaurants that has gotten even better with age.

December 8, 2012|The food was very very good.|5|The food was very very good. our server suggested the tuna they had on special, which is probably the best my husband has ever had. very fresh and cooked to perfection, lightly coated so the seseme seeds did not overpower the tuna. I had the cajun dusted scallops and shrimp, served over sweet spagetti squash, the flavor combination was great. My daughter had the filet mignon, which was cooked to perfect medium and did not need a steak knife. we shared a chocolate peanut butter dessert which was very good. The service was excellent even though the restaurant was extremely busy. I would definately recommend for a special occasion as it is a little pricey, but definatley worth it...enjoy!!!
December 8, 2012|Consistently Great!|5|This is still my favorite restaurant of all time. I used to be a road warrior and traveled extensively all over the country. I've never found a place that was better and more importantly is consistently great. I drive 90 miles from CT just to go here. The owner, Dimitri, treats you like family and runs a very tight ship.

He proceeded to take our personal preferences and prepare a surprising 3 course dinner with variations for all of us. It was a masterpiece of flavors, preparation, and terrific service. We passed all dishes around family-style and enjoyed a wonderful sampling that left us tremendously satisfied. Don't bother selecting from the menu....just ask Demitri to surprise you!
October 6, 2012|Rain suggestions|3|We all had a wonderful meal but all else could have used improving. It was pouring when we got there and I had requested the patio due to water/fire The neighboring table complained loudly so they got moved indoors. We decided to weather the storm, but had to close all the sides of the tent ourselves. Our waitress disappeared until we asked if we had one. She then proceede to apologize profusely. It was freezing and towards the end of the meal I asked it they had a heater at which point they lit the one behind us These things should have been done without us requesting
October 6, 2012|Gracious, professional, delicious.|4|We were seted outside to enjoy Waterfire, a prime table on an extremely busy night. But rain and wind made the usually beautiful seating problematic. My wife asked if we could be relocated inside. The restaurant was booked completely as it was the last full lighting of Waterfire and was a Saturday night. Within minutes, we we welcomed inside, creatively seed at a large table that was the only one open, and treated to superb service from our server, Trish. The matre'd was gracious, accommodating and calm. The food was outstanding. A lovely night instead of a possible unpleasantly soggy one.

Only downside was our reservation was for 8pm and they didn't seat us until 8:30, which is absurd - why take reservations at all then!? A call ahead of time letting us know they were going to be late seating us would have been the least they could do.

My original reservation requested outdoor seating as it was a special occasion and a guest who had never been to Providence. I called at noon to confirm the reservation to find out the reservation was for inside. I was promised a call by Sean, within the hour he had it taken care of. I looked for Sean after we dined but with a full house and a wedding to attend to, he was busy and I couldn't find him to thank him. I will be calling the restaurant to personally thank him and his staff. Our waiter, Constantine, was very attentive, professional and had fabulous suggestions. It could not have been better. Thank you. CN is one of my favorite restaurants in Providence.
August 30, 2012|DELICIOUS! Loved this restaurant|5|DELICIOUS! Loved this restaurant and it started our visit to Providence and Cape Cod in such a positive light. The restaurant dining outdoors under a nearly full moon was so lovely under the cabanas. We had just taken the gondola ride below on the river and could watch them as they rowed by. Had the scallops with risotto - still thinking about these the most perfectly prepared. Highly recommend.
August 25, 2012|Don't valet your car.|4|My meal was fine however the next morning I realized that my coins and bills were completely gone from my car which I valeted at the restaurant.
August 24, 2012|not perfect but better than fine!|3|Love this restaurant but this time was not as good as usual...fish was not as tasty and our waiter was a little unattentive..he just got married so maybe that was it!!! Will not keep me away--at Cafe Nuovo all the time and will continue to go..can't be perfect ALL the time!!

July 28, 2012|Excellent experience all around!|5|I had not been to Cafe Nuovo in several years and decided to try it out again with my wife on a Saturday night. With so many choices in Providence for fine dining, it is great to see this place had not lost its touch. Everything from the greeting by the maître d', the attentive bar, the gorgeous menu choices and waiter service was all top-notch. You couldn't have asked for a better resturaunt experience...bravo!
July 28, 2012|what an enjoyable evening|5|what an enjoyable evening the service was fantastic our waiter helped making this an enjoyable evening for our special occasion the food was out of this world from the appetizer to our main course the sword fish was one of the best I have had I highly recommend it I give it a big 10
July 23, 2012|Have been here several times|4|"Have been here several times and have never been disappointed. The setting, overlooking part of the water fire venue, and the decor are a perfect complement to the tasty and creative cuisine. We were a party of 4 for lunch and all of the dishes , from a simple Bibb lettuce salad to a tender veal dish, were perfectly presented and had everyone giving the kitchen kudos. The wine list is extensive and fairly priced. The only nit is that not all the wines have the vintages printed on the wine list which leads to the ""can you get me the years on these"" game which can be somewhat annoying. Not sure why restaurants do this given the standard software packages that they have for their businesses. Otherwise a great experience."

July 21, 2012|Great experience|5|We had the best time! As usual the food is delicious and the service is amazing. Vanessa was our server and she was excellent. We went the night of the water fires and the restaurant was very busy. You would never know that with the service we received from Vanessa. We were there for 3 hours and we were treated like we were the only customers there. We received the BEST service. We LOVE this restaurant ! The food is always great.
July 20, 2012|When I made a reservation|1|"When I made a reservation using your online site, the software ""reverted"" from my selected date to one where seating was still available. The software indicated ""confirmed"" and I did not notice the date change on the fine print."
July 20, 2012|We made a mistake on the date|4|We made a mistake on the date of our reservation, and even though it was a Saturday night of water fire they found a great table for us in a very reasonable time period. The restaurant was very full, but the waitstaff and everyone were great. The food excellent, portions too large so I would share an appetizer or salad in the future...all in all, we are going to be back to try other dishes on the large menu...
July 19, 2012|Have dined here on several|5|Have dined here on several occasions. It is always one of the best in terms of food quality and location in the city. Dining outside seated along the river is a great experience -- very European.
July 18, 2012|We were able to sit outside|5|We were able to sit outside on a very plesant summer evening, taking advantage of their great location by the river. It was a quiet night, but this would certainly be the place to take in a Providence Waterfire. The service was very professional - attentive to our needs, but astute enough to realize that we were there as a group of 6 to visit with each other, so he was not pushy or intrusive. The food was excellent, beautifully presented, and portioned in a way where everyone was satisfied. Overall, an excellent dining experience and highly recommended.
July 18, 2012|This was our second time at|5|This was our second time at Cafe Nuovo and it was just as wonderful this time around. The food was excellent, the service was great and we got to sit out on the patio and enjoy the view of the city and the river.
July 17, 2012|Went during Providence restaurant|5|Went during Providence restaurant week but the same items were on the regular menu so I felt we received the same quality food. There were three large groups which I think affected the service and the noise level. Would definitely return.
July 14, 2012|Excellent|5|As always, food was top-notch and the outside seating next to the canal is perfect for a romantic dinner or a great group get together. The manager (forgot his name, sorry) is always courteous and accomodating to your special requests. Make sure you try the risotto and for dessert, the mousse pot!
July 14, 2012|Haven't been here in years|4|Haven't been here in years and so glad that we finally returned! Food and service were excellent...especially the desserts made by their in-house pastry chef!

June 25, 2012|Had a wonderful date night|4|Had a wonderful date night with my husband! Amazing food, great service and a perfect location! Highly recommended!
June 23, 2012|Great Food Among Chaos|2|While the food was excellent, there were many different problems with the service. I was surprised to find that there is no bar or martini menu and ended up ordering my old standby Cosmo. The place was very noisy and made even more unpleasant by the repeated jarring sound of crashing dinnerware. I had high expectations for this restaurant and was really disappointed. I realize they were extra busy because it was a water fire night, but things were positively chaotic.
June 22, 2012|Beware to the portion-conscious.|4|Beware to the portion-conscious. The appetizers can easily serve 3 or 4. The entrees are designed for football players. And you might as well invite the neighbors to help with the dessert. Make no mistake, the food and service are very good, sometimes bordering on excellent. Just prepare yourself to be airlifted out of the restaurant after the meal, because that's the only way you'll be able to get out of your chair.

Our server was polite, fun, and into the spirit of our evening. We were in no hurry and our server spaced everything just right. The food was fantastic, especially if you like beef. The wine list excellent, we went for the Mondavi (Napa) Fume Blanc. I would recommend Cafe Nuovo to anyone.

June 2, 2012|This was our first visit to|5|This was our first visit to Cafe Nuovo.....it will not be our last! From start to end the whole experience was first-rate. The food was fabulous, and on top of the extensive menu they offered tantalizing specials as well. Desserts were exceptional also! The wait staff was attentive, informative and friendly. Noise level was energetic....they certainly packed a lot of people into the establishment, but not so that it was disruptive. Valet parking is convenient and speedy. We particularly appreciated that our request for a table with a view was honored, as we were celebrating our 36th wedding anniversary and it made it all the more special.
June 2, 2012|Fantastic!|5|We went here to celebrate our tenth anniversary. I picked it based on the OpenTable reviews, and we were very happy. The place was terrific! The staff was very attentive and knowledgable, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend it.
June 2, 2012|Expensive for average|3|Food was good but not outstanding for the prices! Bottles of wine were three times the cost over retail--a bit much! Service was excellent. I certainly do not mind paying for an outstanding dining experience but this was only very good, at best. Not sure I would return there anytime soon as there are so many more places I want to try!
June 2, 2012|Loved it! We had 2 RISD grads|5|Loved it! We had 2 RISD grads and families for a large group of 16. The food was delicious and the service, fabulous. Could not have been better!!!!!
June 1, 2012|Very satisfied|4|Had a great meal on the outdoor patio. It was a bit chilly with a strong wind, but the patio heater and curtains were able to fix both issues. Service was excellent and our waiter was very attentive to the temperature and wind, and addressed both immediately. Food was very good and it's in a great location for an outdoor meal.
May 31, 2012|Marvelous setting, great,|5|Marvelous setting, great, great food, our waiter was a little bit over enamored with the young ladies at the next table, and consequently payed us less attention than we deserved. What I most appreciated however was that we were never rushed and felt comfortable. Bar tender and host were most friendly and accommodating . Over all I would rate the Cafe an A+.
May 30, 2012|When in Providence..|5|Cafe Nuovo is consistently outstanding. Great service, superb cuisine. Very enjoyable all around. I have been to Nuovo for small dinners- 2-6 people and also hosted a party in their rotunda last fall. Doesn't matter if you are 1 person or 100- they take great care of you. The General Manger, Sean, is excellent to work with- experienced, professional and very nice. My last dinner at Nuovo was girls night out-we sat outside and it was just beautiful.
May 27, 2012|When initially making the|5|When initially making the reservations I was asked if there were any special requests, my answer was simply that it was my wife's birthday and would like a nice table if available...we'll not only did we have a great table for two but they must have made note of the birthday and with our dessert order made hers extra special and included a birthday greeting. Now some may think that as normal but I see it as exceptional service as I did not request anything or expecting anything....this made for an extra bit of service that I truly appreciated. There food is out of this world, service from minute one was great and all together made for a wonderful experience.
May 20, 2012|This place is always tops.|5|This place is always tops. Even when they have a misstep (which is rare), you call over the Owner/Dimitry or whoever is on, and they fix it on the spot, no questions. Very comforting to know they take care of you there.

It was almost too perfect to be real! Our greeting from the maitre de & bartender were so warm & welcoming, the waitress was very professional, atmosphere and cuisine superb. The menu offered so many wondeful entrees that it was difficult to narrow down my selection. As they say ""soup to nuts"" - this spot offers it all . I cannot wait to return here. We were celebrating two birthdays & a college graduation - graduate degree. So glad we chose Cafe Nuovo. Thx to all that made a perfect evening & end to our long weekend in Providence."

We all took home doggie bags and excitedly finished our meals at a second sitting! Pricing is at the high end for lunch but can't complain about either the quality or the service. A true special occasion restaurant.

May 5, 2012|Wonderful variety on the menu.|5|Wonderful variety on the menu. The food was really outstanding. The vibe was nicely busy, sophisticated, noisy enough but not too noisy to have a conversation at a table for five. Our table by the window afforded us a surprise view of gondolas going by on the river -- pleasant, almost European-feeling. It was nice that, unlike several other (also upscale) options we considered for our dinner out in Providence, they take reservations for parties of fewer than six people. Would absolutely go there again. Only minor annoyance was that, with a huge parking lot right there, we were forced to do valet parking.

April 27, 2012|Everything i hoped for and more|5|Cafe Nuovo was excellent. Prices were resonable for an upscale resturant. Food was amazing particularly the cream spinach side and the Seafood nuovo cocktail app. Our waitress was pleasant, knowledgable, and excellent in aiding us with our meal decisions. We also had a late reservation so we were the last people in the resturant and with out interuption they would have let us spend the entire evening enjoying our wine if we wanted. overall 10 out of 10 in my book and thats a rare.
Dined on April 17, 2012|Wonderful night to eat outside.|5|Wonderful night to eat outside. Service is excellent here. The food is always freshly prepared and amazing.

The menu and specials are plentiful with some unique combinations and our meals were delicious and cooked perfectly to our liking. Our server Bryan was very attentive and personable.

Started with a warm welcome, our table was ready, special requests at time of reservation honored. Our waiter, Nathan, was absolutely the most pleasant person; patient, precise, well mannered, knowledgeable, and on and on, GREAT job. These are only a few of the many positives at Cafe Nuovo! The Swordfish (req. a thick piece) was absolutely delicious and an amazing cut, BEST I have had in many years!! The duck, again, was absolutely delicious! MANY more delights, so PLEASE do yourself a favor, go and ENJOY and find out what you have been missing!! We WILL be back. Thank you Cafe Nuovo for the best dinner,service, and atmosphere we have had in a long time!!
March 9, 2012|Love at first bite|5|I LOOOOVE this place. This is our 3rd visit. It takes an hour fifteen to get there without traffic but it's worth it. We used our opentable spotlight deal. LF had the potato & leek soup. She loved it as usual. I had the crab cake. OMG!!! I even ate the slaw and I hate slaw. For dinner LF had the tenderloin risotto. It was fantastic & I'm a bit of a risotto snob. I had the tuna special with coconut/vanilla cooked rice & tempura asparagus. HEAVEN!!! For dessert we had the chocolate cake. I love the little twists they put on their desserts w/ presentation. The presentation on all the dishes is always fantastic. Love this place, their complimentary valet, and extremely convenient parking.

March 3, 2012|This would be a great place|3|This would be a great place to view waterfire during events. The food was delicious, well presented and of high quality. The employees did not do anything to welcome us. They were polite. There was nothing special. Our server did not make small talk or even introduce himself to us. He did not ask if we had ever been here before or invite us to return. I have visited The Capitol Grille several times and expected similar ambiance and service. This fell far short of my expectations and I have no desire to return.

March 2, 2012|When I made my reservation|5|"When I made my reservation for Cafe Nuovo I requested a quiet table away from ""the crowd"" for a quiet belated Valentine and birthday dinner. When I called to come in early I was told that the table I requested might not be ready yet but that they had other tables available. When we arrived the table still wasn't ready but when we saw the location we were glad to wait. The food was outstanding - we had the crab cake appetizer which was wonderful, my husband did the al-la-carte salmon and I had the braised lamb shank - more than I could eat. All in all it was a wonderful dinner and a wonderful night.....thank-you"

Terrific! The crab cake app. was one of the best we've had...anywhere! Our server was friendly and knowledgeable regarding the menu and had an ""A"" game on the service side, attentive, but not overly hanging at the table. Just a great night and worth the price.

The salad was delicious and unique with a combinatation of lettuce, sliced fruit and tradtitional vegetables. The grande finale was the chocalate mousse.

We requested a table by the window but were seated at a table in the corner as far from the window as possible. The restaurant was not busy as our reservation was for 6:15 pm. We asked to have our table changed and were seated at a very strange table at a window on the side of the door. We elected to return to our original table. When we left at 7:30 pm other window tables were still unoccupied. We were disappointed only in the hosts' service.
January 21, 2012|Went to Cafe Nuovo on several|4|Went to Cafe Nuovo on several recommendations. Had a good dining experience, but the wait staff was very mixed in terms of skill and attentiveness. The only thing that really soured the experience was our waiter forgot about us for about 15-20min at the end after we said we wanted our food packaged to go and wanted the check. Other than that very nice. Food was excellent, Wine list was great. I had the lamb shank which was tender and delicious.
January 21, 2012|delish!|5|food was fabulous. waiter was super attentive. wines - supurb. not as cozy of a restaurant as i usually like, but it was wonderful and we will be returning very soon!

January 20, 2012|Another great experience|5|From the moment we walked in the door, service was great. Our coats taken and reservation confirmed, we were escorted to a slightly cramped table layout which could be due to restaurant week or the inability to seat outside (sitting outside in warm weather offers a great view of the downtown water). But the waiter was clearly making a career of it and the food was fantastic. Wonderful presentation and flavors; every dish expertly thought out. The portions were very large and served as lunch the next day for all four of our party. An excellent dinning experience once again.
January 16, 2012|as usual a great night at|4|as usual a great night at Cafe Nuovo. Food spectacular and service great. Really enjoyed restaurant week menu. Only complaint is a lack of a printed wine by the glass menu. Found this to be awkward when trying to order, server had to recite the available selections. Would be much more customer friendly if there was a list that you could look over even before the server arrived. Other than that everything was terrific.Thanks again.
January 14, 2012|This was our second trip to|3|This was our second trip to this restaurant and slightly below par with our first experience. Although my meal was very good, my wife's meal was overcooked and below par for what we were anticipating based upon our visit of 1/14/2011. We were initially directed toward seating which gave us very little distance from the next table: i.e. chair backs could easily touch making it difficult to get in and out without disturbing the patrons next to us. So we asked to be moved. The manager asked what the problme was and we explained it to him. He seemed a little taken back by our comment. But unfortuantely it set a rather low tone for the rest of the evening. In the end removed the cost of my wife's meal from the bill. Little consulation

The ambiance is classic upscale white table cloth but comfortable with an open kitchen. I had veal chop which was perfectly prepared and ""lolipoped"" (first time I have seen that) and covered with a truffle butter. just perfect. My husband had the rissotto w/tenderloin, mushroom and bluecheese which was again perfectly prepared. meat med rare, mushroom flavor intense and the risotto was just right and creamy. The manager/host was extremely welcoming and whipped up an off the menu bourbon cocktail for me. The service is quiet and very professional. We have been here several times and always leave happy."

December 3, 2011|I went to Cafe Nuovo for Saturday|5|"I went to Cafe Nuovo for Saturday night dinner, celebrating anniversary with my girlfriend. Cocktails made by Chris the bartender were delicious. Crab cake appetizer was the best I've ever had (almost entirely crab meat). She ordered Atlantic salmon as main which was richly flavorful, perfectly cooked with a delightful crispy crunch. I ordered lamb shank (which takes ~45 mins after ordering) which was deliciously tender. We split the cranberry-pear crisp for dessert, which included a candle and ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate. Excellent service by our waitress and by the manager who stopped at out table. Normally this would be out of our price range, but $50 for $25 from Open Table made it worth it. Try the crab cake!"

November 25, 2011|Exceptional Restaurant!|5|Outstanding in every way. Menu is extremely well thought-out, with the option of simple grilled steaks and seafood or having the same items presented in a composition plate. Menu changes with the season and the desserts are worth saving room for. Exceptional wine list with some hard-to-find bottles at reasonable prices. Service was exceptional. You couldn't ask for a better night out!

October 29, 2011|An exceptional meal|5|The escargot appetizer was in a sauce that was almost addictive, we ended up keeping it at the table for some time to dip the bread into long after the snails had been devoured. I had the lamb chops from the grill, they were cooked to perfection and the mashed sweet potato side was delicious as well. My boyfriend had the boullibase and they spared no variety of seafood in it, it was all fresh as well. The crowning dish though was the dessert, we had the Halloweed special which was a chocolate cake and many different hand made garnishes that created a haunted graveyard scene, it was almost too pretty to eat and was definitey a work of art showing a skilled pastry chef on staff. We will definitely be back!
October 26, 2011|Great place to celebrate anniversar|4|Have been to Cafe Nuovo many times before but not recently. Had a fairly early reservation but even then was a bit noisy but got more so as more patrons showed up. That being said, the service was excellent and the food was outstanding and much better than I had remembered from the past.
October 22, 2011|We had an 8:45PM reservation.|4|We had an 8:45PM reservation. When we got to the restaurant it was packed, but there were a few open tables. We gave the host our name and he told us it would be a few minutes and to wait at the bar (which was packed). We waited near the front, and 10 minutes later he asked us our names again (he had no recollection of speaking to us earlier). It was then that he gave us one of the empty tables. Very strange. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food, and his recommendations were great! The service was a bit slow, and our waiter seemed to give up on us halfway through the meal. We had a different server for our dessert order. Overall it was a nice evening.

Was giving an excellent window table away from the main floor which was nice since it was very busy on a weds(sign of a great place). We started with a half btl of Caymus ""condurum"" and had the oysters and steak tartare. Both apps were amazing,fresh, and well executed. Only suggestion would be more toast pts with the tartare since it is a very generous portion. Next we had the soup and salad specials and both were delightful. For dinners we had the braised shortrib, sirloin, and the beeftip risotto. OMG, everything was out of this world. Also had a btl of E. Guigal Chateau nauf du pape.. amazing. Pot of mousse for dessert. Outstanding dining experience.Staff was amazing! TY"

Everyone was overly impressed with with the service of staff and food. I had the salmon which was the best I ever had the Mr had a steak well done which was excellent. The lamb chops were also great. We are from the NY area if ever in Providence we will sure dine here again.
October 7, 2011|FOOD HEAVEN|5|"One word describes the food, service, and atmosphere..OUTSTANDING! The resturant is beautiful. The decor was sophisticated with lots of windows overlooking the river (where Waterfire is held). We were immediately greeted and ushered to our table, even though 2 people from our party had not arrived. And from this point on we felt like we were in ""food heaven"". The menu is extensive but the waiter was excellent; he was attentive and offered suggestions to those of us who couldn't make up our minds. We ordered wine, appetizers, and desserts besides our main course and everyting was prepared beautifully. From the seafood to the steaks to the duck -all of our meals were superb. We will defintely go back again, one of the best meals ever!"

We were seated in an area that was used as a throughway for the waiters to get to other tables. After getting bumped bybwaiters numerous times, my son finally moved his seat. This was unacceptable. In general the tables are pretty tightly spaced, but this was very annoying. Unfortunately, our waiter was so inattentive that we couldn't even ask him to have the waiters use another routenor move us to another table. It was a waterfire night, but it early and the restaurant wasn't full. My last experience there was very good so I suspect the waiter had too many tables...but that is no excus
September 15, 2011|A very nice place to dine|4|"A very nice place to dine for special occasions. Would be even nicer during the Waterfire events as it sits right on the water with outside dining weather permitting. We went on a Thursday night and it was packed. The tables are fairly densely arranged and it did get quite loud. We had the calamari and shrimp appetizer which was one of the best I've had. For main course the Mrs. had salmon which was amazing-just a touch of crispiness on the outside and very fresh. I ordered lamb chops off the grill menu-good but plain to my taste. Stick to the main portion of the menu for the ""finished"" dishes."

Great choice for that special occasion or business lunch to impress clients.

I asked him to come up with a proseco spritzer for my wife and he created a terrific concoction. Our group of 12 was adequately seated outside along the river. The servers were very responsive and on top of the whole meal. Appetizers were very good and steaks were cooked right. The only criticism that I have (although minor) was with the desserts. Years ago, the desserts were very extravagant and its own reason to visit the restaurant. This time, they were good, but much more basic and the appearance was just OK. Overall, there were no complaints from anyone (except maybe the other guests).

It was certainly not a relaxing place (what with waiters all over the place running into our elbows) to enjoy a meal and the waitress really could care less about us. In fact she didn't even listen to our request to wrap up our leftovers or and was annoyed to tell us the wine by the glass list. If you are looking for a place to feel welcomed and appreciated, step across the street to Capital Grille. They do it right.

This was our first time dining here and all my hopes and expectations for the evening were met, and then some. I was disappointed in the attire of some of the guests - business casual/upscale casual doesn't mean jeans, shorts and t-shirts....also gentlemen smoking cigars in the smoking ""area"" off the patio took away from the evening's perfection"

The service is competent, friendly, and accommodating. The wine list is very varied and offers many affordable bottles. The only complaint is that the vintages on the list did not match the bottles offered and in the instance of French wines this is a rather significant problem.

Endive salad with goat cheese dressing was incredible. Halibut special with littlenecks and butter/wine sauce was the best halibut I have ever had. Husband's rib eye was cooked to perfection. Kids were hoping the chef would make fettucine alfredo but that was not an option. They are very fussy and the waiter recommended the mac n cheese with grilled chicken. They both loved their meal. The almond berry desert special was delicious and so was the homemade raspberry sorbet. Perfection in everything especially presentation. Should have been in Phantom Gourmet's top 8 in Providence!

May 29, 2011|Creative menu, as good as promised|4|"The menu was creative, and the food lived up to its promise. I particularly liked the striped bass with two intermingled sauces: rhubarb and blood-orange beurre blanc. The sauces complemented each other and the fish, which was flavorful, but not at all gamey. Our two desserts, the Pot O' Mousse and Cinnamon Bread Pudding were equally decadent. I rated it 4 stars vs. 5 only because I didn't walk out thinking ""Wow!"" as I have at some very rare restaurants (with prices twice as high). The service was superb."
May 28, 2011|Consistently excellent, creative|4|Consistently excellent, creative food. All six in our party had perfect appetizers, entrees and desserts. Good wine selection, although overpriced. Decor is modern and attractive. Service was friendly, but not polished, and the wait time between courses was very long (we didn't mind, because it was a special occasion, but a three-plus hour meal is not for everyone). Overall, a very nice dining experience, especially if it's all about the food.
May 28, 2011|Graduaton Night|5|We had a special, wonderful graduation celebration at Nuovo. The atmosphere was delightful. We had a view of the river celebrations. There was food choices for all...pizza, chicken, beef, seafood and vegetarian. My husband and I split an appetizer, salad and entree but not the dessert! Service was excellent even on a busy night. We would definitely come back.
May 20, 2011|We have been at Nuovo numerous|5|We have been at Nuovo numerous times. As usual, service and food were outstanding. Highlights: One of the best soft-shell crab dishes I ever ate (was an appetizer special) and a delicious duck breast with rhubarb purée, arugula, bacon, and strawberry balsamic sauce. Be carful about portions -- we usually share (e.g., 2 appetizers and 2 mains for 3 people).

May 4, 2011|Always good|4|Cafe Nuovo never fails to meet my expectations. There are always interesting and delicious specials and the service is impeccable. It's a great location for warm weather outdoor dining on the river.
May 2, 2011|This was an all around great|4|This was an all around great experience ... Food, Service, Ambiance was excellent. I would recommend this for any special occasion. We were celebrating a special Birthday, and our server was very accommodating. They even wrote the Birthday girl's name on the dessert plate. There were no leftovers, which is pretty rare for our Ladies Lunch Group. The specials of the day were excellent. If the day was warmer, we would have enjoyed sitting outside.

The staff was very helpful arranging seating when two unexpected friends joined us. Have enjoyed dinner at Cafe Nuovo as well. It is always excellent.
April 24, 2011|Worth the Price|4|"This is my third time dining at Cafe Nuovo, though it's my first time attending during a holiday. My reservation went from 4 to 6 to 7 within a 10-day period and it was never a problem, despite adding the last seat (a 3-year old) three days prior to the reservation. The food is always excellent and the friendliness and attentiveness of all the staff is always superb. I was impressed with how many members of the wait staff stopped to give the 3-year old attention and compliment him and his father. One guest in my party is an admitted ""wine snob"" from NY and he was impressed, as was his friend from Queens who dines at the finest restaurants in NY. No one at the table wasn't pleased with dinner - quite the opposite."

April 24, 2011|MMMMMMMMMM.........|5|As a vegan I usually have difficulty finding food at restaurants, howwever, at CN I was able to get 2 FABULOUS dishes for dinner. The chopped salad w/o feta was fresh and fabulous, it did not look like it had been through the meat grinder!!!! The side of pasta and marinara was so good I hated to leave some for the next day. Again, very fresh tasting. My husband's steak was cooked just right. He ate it the next day cold and enjoyed it just as much. I tried his sauted spinach side dish and wanted to put my face on his dish and not come up until the spinach was gone!!!!
April 23, 2011|Wonderful food experience!|4|We were at the restaurant to celebrate a birthday. The food was awesome!We tried four different appetizers and they were all delicious. The Chicken Flatbread appetizer was a standout-each of the flavors within the flatbread jumped out at you. We ordered all different main meals: salmon, pasta with clams, short-ribs and all were yummy. Our forks were passed around to each for tastings!were Portion sizes were ample. We left with a few doggy-bags! My only complaint was where we were seated. A reservation had been made well in advance and they were told it was a special birthday however we were seated at the first table by the front door, where all the traffic was. It would have been nice to have been seated away from all the congestion.
April 23, 2011|Cafe WOW!|5|We were looking for a nice upscale yet affordable restaurant to enjoy as part of our weekend getaway to RI, and we were not disappointed here. The dishes were creative and delicious. We got lucky with a window table overlooking the canal, which added to the experience. Valet parking and coat check was also a nice surprise.

April 9, 2011|Once again, Dimitri & Sean|5|Once again, Dimitri & Sean as well as the rest of the crew at Cafe Nuovo came through with an outstanding dining experience. Fantastic food and great service.. couldn't ask for more. This is, without a doubt.. the BEST restaurant in RI!
April 2, 2011|We went with an Open Table|5|"We went with an Open Table Spotlight deal. While the food was delicious, the prices were high enough that we wouldn't return ""on our own dime."""

March 19, 2011|A Restaraunt experience to die for!|5|We had a 50th Birthday dinner and it was the best food and service any of us had in quite some time. I had the Dover Sole which was the best I have ever had, Then all the girls ate stuffed rigatoni all I heard was to die for! The wine list was huge and our choice was exquisite. We had Vincente as our waiter and he was awesome, one of the best we've had in a long time. I would recommend Cafe Nuovo to anyone who appreciates great food and attentive service! We will definetly recommend this to our friends and will return shortly.
March 19, 2011|Good Time Had By All|4|Had Saturday night 6:45 dinner reservation for four. Called to let them know I would be running about 5 minutes late. Reservationist very understanding and polite. Sat down upon arrival and dined and drank until 10:00. Never felt rushed and waitress was extremely attentive. Great venue for dinner. Food, service and atmoshpere excellent. One of Providence's better restaurant's and a change from the great Italien food offered throughout the city. Definitely recommend it and definitely would go back again.

March 11, 2011|This place was absolutely|5|This place was absolutely fantastic. Can't say enough great stuff about it. The food was amazing and NOT over-priced. The atmosphere was quiet, even w/ a group of 10 guys seated next to us. Our server was super friendly and helped us pick out a couple great dishes. I highly recommend the roasted half chicken. The skin is cooked to absolute perfection. I can still taste it. Dessert was not only very beautifully presented but tasted amazing. Can be a little expensive so definitely go to impress someone or for that special occasion.

March 4, 2011|A Delightful Dinner in Providence|5|"Fantastic food, great waitress, and I had notified them via Open Table that we were celebrating our 29th Anniversary, they had ""Happy 29th Anniversary"" written out on the rim of our dessert plates, with a candle on each! An outstanding touch and greatly appreciated. We had a wonderful time and definitely recommend it to the next person!"
February 26, 2011|The food was very good. The|3|The food was very good. The drinks were very good as usual. The service was Ok (not very attentive). My wife and I had a table overlooking the patio and the water which was very nice. Our main complaint was the frenzied activity of the wait staff. They were all rushing back & forth to and from the tables. It created a very stressfull envoironment that was not conducive to enjoying a relaxing evening dining out.
February 26, 2011|Great meal once again at Cafe|5|Great meal once again at Cafe Nuovo, as expected. The new menu had several incredible offerings - sweet potato soup ***** Tom and Cindy loved their short ribs ***** Bill loved the baked macaroni and my salmon was incredible! Everyone was delighted with their choices. Terrific seeing Dimitri busy at work in the open kitchen, Amber was our delightful, attentive server. We definitely will return to this wonderful downtown Providence restaurant.

February 12, 2011|great service, great food,|4|great service, great food, clientele that is too full of themselves
February 12, 2011|First time visiting. Based|4|First time visiting. Based on what we had been told read, the experience was going to be driven by the staff's ability to handle the volume. Waterfire nights were to be avoided, pre theatre could feel rushed. So on our Saturday night we went in a little leery, given the number of people who would be dining early for Valentines. Our expectations were far exceeded. Everyone was friendly, attentive and very welcoming. The food was outstanding. Escargot, Nuovo Salad for Apps. Lamb and Bouillabaisse for dinner. A chocolate/coconut ice cream for dessert. Bring your big boy wallet if you want a bottle of wine, otherwise ask about wines by the glass, you will find something nice to pair with your courses.
February 12, 2011|This is our second time and|1|This is our second time and it was not good!I had littlenecks and pasta and the dish was so salty I couldn't eat it. My husband had the lambshank and it was mediocre. My biggest issue with the littlenecks was that you get 2 dozen and about 6 did not even open. I paid close too 30 dollars for this dish-I don't mind paying-if it's good.I will say the first time we went there it was good, so we where extremely disappointed at the difference it was like two different places.That being said,the service was good. Wines way overpriced!
February 12, 2011|everything was wonderful|5|everything was wonderful very special will return soon. Great view for waterfire night!

February 5, 2011|There are many great restaurants|5|There are many great restaurants in RI but Cafe Nuovo is at the top of my list. It is always a wonderful experience, from the pre-dinner cocktails, the delicious appetizers, cutting edge entree's & the famous desserts. If you can only go to one restaurant in Providence, make sure that it is Cafe Nuovo.
February 3, 2011|Great Menu - missed an old dessert|4|Great menu selection. The pre-fixe menu offered a good variety. I would suggest enhancing the dessert menu adding more chocolate and perhaps a dessert from the old menu - a stacked banana cake.

Dined on January 26, 2011|Wonderful experience: my only|5|Wonderful experience: my only complaint was that I booked it because of Providence Restaurant Week. When we arrived, our server informed us that they were only participating for dinner. Emailed restaurant later with my concer and have not as yet received a response in 3 days.
January 25, 2011|Cafe Nuovo is Incredible|5|My mom and I went to Cafe Nuovo for Providence Restaurant Weeks.

I would recommend going to this restaurant to anyone especially for a romantic special occasion.

January 22, 2011|Very good experience at Cafe Nuovo|4|Great meal at Cafe Nuovo, particularly thanks to the Maitre d'. When we arrived the tables that were available were not that great so he asked us if we wanted to have a drink at the bar and wait for a table at the window. We were more than happy to as we were not in a rush and after having a drink and waiting about 15 minutes, we ended up with a great table by the window with a wonderful view of the river. I started with the escargot, which was wonderful, and my wife had a salad which was also very good. The risotto with scallops was also good, the scallops very good and the risotto just OK, but overall a very good experience. We will definitely be back.
January 19, 2011|An elegant night out|5|Elegant, good place for a special night out. I asked for some slight changes to my dinner, they accommodated me right away. Top notch place. Very attentive service.

We still had to wait over 30 minutes for our table in the very crowded bar area. I am currently experiencing some health difficulties and standing for this extended period of time was very uncomfortable. The host never gave us an estimated time for how long we may have to wait. The food was average. We both ordered steak, which was good and cooked well. But our sides (potato and veggie) were way too salty and just not very good. If I had another coupon I would return to Cafe Nuovo, otherwise there are many other great restaurants in Providence I would prefer. Overall, a good but not great experience.

December 29, 2010|Every year we take our nieces|5|Every year we take our nieces to the theatre & dessert afterward. Thru web research I decided on Cafe Nuovo for dessert and they did not disappoint. The host, Sean, couldn't have been nicer even when I called to say that we were running late for our 10:30PM reservation on a week night! When we arrived, we found we were the only people in the restaurant but did not receive any attitude and were not rushed even though I am sure that the staff were looking forward to closing up. Sean was so accommodating and actually went out of his way to make our time there special. I cannot thank him enough for his professionalism and hospitality. Desserts were fabulous & the whole experience makes me want to return for dinner even though its an hour drive!

December 11, 2010|This is not my first visit|2|This is not my first visit to this fine establishment. I was a bit disappointed. I expect a restaurant of this caliber to be able to handle the basics; available wine by the glass and after dinner drink printed lists. The food was fine, not great (fatty veal chop). The service was cordial. I know it is the holiday season but I thought the overabundance of flash photography detracted from what was supposed to be an intimate dining experience. If you were planning to ask that special question, do not do it here.

Everyone could not stop talking about how incredibly delicious the food was! Our server was also very attentive and friendly and helped make the entire experience one that we will definitely be repeating! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and I can't wait to have dinner on the outside patio and take in the beautiful views.
November 20, 2010|All of the Cafe Nuovo staff|5|All of the Cafe Nuovo staff did a wonderful job in handling all of my Mother's allergies and making sure she got exactly the meal she wanted. We could not ask for better service and care. It is one of the reasons we all visit as frequently as possible.
November 20, 2010|We were a little early for|4|We were a little early for the dinner crowd (6pm) so it was very quiet when we arrived. As the night went on, it got busy and quite noisy. It's a little cramped in there, getting up to go to the ladies room was a bit of a challange due to so many tables/chairs and then the waitstaff. It was enjoyable being able to watch the chefs in the kitchen. The view of the river was great - it would have been nice if the waterfire was going on. The waitstaff was extremely attentive, didn't write a thing down and nothing came out wrong. Overall, except fo the crowdedness of the place, I'd give it an A.

I am in the customer service line of work and I would love for my staff to be as wonderful as yours were! Great job! The wine list was a little pricey but we were able to find a good bottle of wine for 30.00 and it was delightful. The salads, we all had a different one, were fresh, and the protions more than ample. The entree was delicious and the dessert presentations, (as well as the taste), were amazing! I would highly recommend to anyone!

The Dover sole is de-boned table side and was cooked perfectly. The pastry chef does a great job with classics and a few twists. Good for couples or a business dinner. The bar area is a little small. Valet parking and coat check available.

October 23, 2010|We had an early reservation|3|We had an early reservation and we were seated at an awful table....with the restuarant 10% full...it was disappointing....there were great tables still empty when we left...that is a mismanagement of resources. Our waiter was below average; he continually spilled our 2004 Artesa Cab ($72) everywhere and was overly agressive in filling our glasses. He actually overfilled my wife's glass just to finish the bottle when we were not in any rush. The food is good...don't get me wrong...but $32 for mashed potatoes, carrots and a 14 ounce strip is a bit much. Especially considering how plain the presentation was, no port reduction or anything, and the steak was over seasoned with salt which surprised me. Average experience at best for $200.
October 22, 2010|Beautiful as well as Tasty|5|Right along the water, Cafe Nuovo is a beautiful place. Food is as good to look at as it is to eat. Great special occasion location. Fresh seafood. In such a competitive food scene in Providence, Cafe Nuovo holds its own.
October 22, 2010|Top-notch service, which helps|3|Top-notch service, which helps because many of the menu options need tweaking. Some of the pastas are too oily or over sauced. Excellent desserts.
October 20, 2010|One of the 3 best restaurants|5|"One of the 3 best restaurants in town. Creative, elegant dishes that put hints of the experimental on top of a solid mastery of the known and expected in modern cuisine. Style is hard to pin down. Some French, some local, some Asian—whatever produces a delightful dish that pleases all senses. The quality and creativity are top notch all the way to the desserts (not a given). If there is one thing that's disappointing it's the pricing of the well-selected wine list. There isn't enough effort to offer lower-priced gems. Wines by the glass are expensive as well, though not quite as far out there. The pricing on the food is fair for the quality; they shouldn't ""make up"" for that by overpricing the wine."
October 19, 2010|This is not our first visit|1|This is not our first visit to this restaurant, but if it was, it would be our last. Since it was a Tuesday night, there were approximately 20 people dining at the restaurant. It had adequate staff. We have had great service here before, but the service was poor this night. The food also, was not their usual. Certainly not Cafe Nuovo quality. We were celebrating my birthday and we were very disappointed. We will try this restaurant again because it has been good in the past.
October 16, 2010|The pasta special was great.|5|The pasta special was great. The waiter and the host really made us feel welcome and comfortable.

Dined on October 16, 2010|I would not recommend this|2|I would not recommend this restaurant. For the first time in my experience, they did not have our reservation (although I had the confirmation on my phone). They did seat us promptly. The food was delivered but they never delivered the salad. The food was mediocre at best. The service is bizarre. The wait staff literally runs around banging into tables and chairs. Our waitress was literally hit in the head with a chair while she was describing the specials. The overall feel is a restaurant out of control. The food itself is only fair and the prices are very high.

He was very accommodating. Our waiter had such a good personality and gave good suggestions about the menu. All in all the food was fantastic. I got the rissotto with tenderloin steak and it was the best I've ever had. My husband got a sirloin that came out too rare but they were great about cooking it more and then it was fantastic. The creme bulee was a great end to a fantastic meal. We highly recommend this restaurant.

September 25, 2010|Absolutely perfect. We arrived|5|Absolutely perfect. We arrived at the time of our reservation and was seated promptly in the location that I had requested. Delicious breads and olive oil was served prompted with iced water. Drinks were brought out shortly after ordering. Appetizers were delicious and plenty to share. Our main courses were all outstanding. Desert was perfect. Very creative presentation. The food, service, and location was outstanding and the price was suitable for a high end cafe.

September 11, 2010|As cited in every other opentable.c|5|As cited in every other opentable.com review, Cafe Nuovo has amazing food and a great view if you happen to be there on a Waterfire night. Waitress can us great dinner recommendations and I would go back to Providence from Boston to have dinner there again - pleasantly surprised in every aspect. The only negative (and it was overcome as the hostess was more than kind) is that they were 20 minutes late sitting us for our reservation. Highly recommended.
September 10, 2010|The food was fabulous. Although|4|"The food was fabulous. Although we had only one of the appetizers (we had been to an afternoon wedding), the list was very appealing. The raw oysters were fabulous; an ""experience"" as oysters should be. Elegant swordfish special melted in my mouth. Delightful and attentive but not hovering service. Outstanding."
September 4, 2010|This is a nice restaurant|4|This is a nice restaurant in Providence. They have great desserts. Service is slow here, which was fine for us as we did not want to be pushed out quickly. But definitely slower than average.

It was wonderful - just the nicest server, great atmosphere, creative cuisine, etc. I had the crab cakes appetizer with a flavor to match a great presentation, followed by the White Shrimp dish which was amazingly good. My husband has steak and potatoes but even that was beautifully presented and delicious. I can't say enough good about this restaurant. We reserve it for special occasions and it has never disappointed us yet. Pricey but well worth it.

August 28, 2010|great food and location|4|Cafe Nuovo was excellent. The food and service were worth the expense as the the menu is pricey. My only problem was the wine prices. The wine list was very good but over- priced based upon other restaurants.
August 26, 2010|A very nice evening was had|4|A very nice evening was had by the three of us. The food was very good and the evening was delightful.
August 21, 2010|I hadn't been here for many|5|I hadn't been here for many years but noticed that the menu had changed, substantially. In years gone bye I could only describe the food as pretty, I.E. tiny portions of odd food stacked four inches high on your plate. Not sufficient for me despite the incredible setting, outside, right on the river, overlooking the gondolas. It is now perfectly normal with quite a few specials for those with interests more exotic than mine. I guess they would be the foodies? I had a nice salad and a giant tenderloin with mashed potato and broccoli. What more could I ask! Wine list is fine and runs from fairly priced regulars to expensive serious types. Pre-dinner cocktail was perfectly done. Anyone should be happy here!
August 21, 2010|Service was the best I have|5|Service was the best I have seen in ages. Wonderful waitstaff, food exceptional from apps to desert. Cost was appropriate for the level of service we recieved. Would recommend eating outside, inside seemed too loud and crowded, outside was PERFECT! Looking forward to going back.

They were very impressed by the restaurant, the delicious food, terrific pasta dishes, and the service was outstanding. Although it was a quiet night at the restaurant, which was a welcome change, the service was spot on. Our waiter was attentive. Sean, the restaurant manager, does everything he can to insure you leave intending to return. Thank you Sean and your staff for another great dining experience at Cafe Nuovo.

August 12, 2010|We would have loved to dine|5|We would have loved to dine outside by the riverwalk. Unfortunately, the wind was blowing. Although, they have canopies with sides outside, the wind was too strong forcing us inside. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us. The food was outstanding.

We definitely will return the next time we're in Providence. I don't know that I would recommend taking younger children here, but I would recommend it for everyone else, particularly if you're looking for a romantic evening.

August 2, 2010|We've eaten here many times,|5|We've eaten here many times, but this past occasion reminded us of just how good it always is. Food, service, waiter were all terrific. Couldn't ask for more from a dining experience. Wonderful time! Oysters were absolutely fresh and sweet. Osso buco was perfect - flavorful and fork tender. Kitchen even made dish that was no longer on menu - fried spaghetti.
July 31, 2010|We had a reservation for 2|3|We had a reservation for 2 on a Saturday night. We waited 30 minutes for our table which is generally inappropriate for this level of restaurant. Nothing was offered to compensate. The wine list was not current and the bar had not even heard of the bottle of wine we ordered off the menu. The waiter was someone who would fit better at a chain restaurant. He struggled with opening the bottle, place settings did not arrive in time for both the bread and the second course and was clearly spread too thin. The food was good. I actually thought the portion size for the main course was too large and I could not finish it which has never happened to me at a gourmet restaurant before. Overall disappointed with the experience.
July 31, 2010|I keep coming back to Cafe|5|I keep coming back to Cafe Nuovo - I love it! Great food, wonderfully prepared...and great service! The location determined my first time. The food and service keep me coming back. From out of town, this is now my fourth or fifth time back. Keep up the good work! Next time I'm in Providence, Cafe Nuovo is on my calling card!

July 17, 2010|We had a fantastic time at|5|We had a fantastic time at Café Nuovo on Saturday night! We dined outside on Riverwalk with a perfect view of the lighting of Waterfire. Our server, Manny was wonderful and gave us some of the best service we’ve ever had! Our meals were impressive. To start, I enjoyed the grilled pizza which was absolutely full of meat (and quite large for an appetizer). For my entree, I had the roasted chicken which was tender enough to cut with a fork. My partner had a scallop/pork belly starter which he said was melt in his mouth good. He also ordered the swordfish which was perfectly cooked. We didn’t have enough room for dessert but everything sounded delicious. We will definitely dine at Café Nuovo again!

The service was cheerful and capable with the exception of not being given spoons with which to eat our soup. There was a short wait for them. We were trying out the restaurant as a possible wedding rehearsal dinner venue and were given helpful information on private parties by the GM who came to our table. The soups and chowders, salads and sandwiches were perfectly prepared and arrived hot and appetizing. Our server checked in periodically to be sure we had what we needed. The clientele at lunchtime was primarily businessmen, many in suits but there were mixed parties as well. It was a satisfying, upscale, scenic oasis for lunch on a very hot and humid day in the city.

May 29, 2010|WOW! This restaurant exceeded|5|WOW! This restaurant exceeded all our expectations. The mac and cheese with chicken was to die for and normally I am not a big fan. The halibut was perfectly done, perhaps the best I've had and it was a generous portion. The chopped salad and the breads served with whole olives in the oil were delicious. My husband has been searching for bouillabase like he had in Marseille and he said this came pretty close. The fish was very tender. The waitress was delightful and made the evening! We were too full to have dessert unfortunately but I'm sure they were also fabulous. If you're lucky enough to be there for Waterfire the outdoor tables have the best view in the city. If you are in Providence I highly recommend this restaurant.

Portions were generously sized and all of the evening's specials sounded mouth-watering. The service was great and food was served at a nice pace. We went to this restaurant almost two years ago and enjoyed it but this last visit was an even better experience. The food and service was wonderful and memorable and we look forward to returning.
May 20, 2010|This is simply a great restaurant.|5|"This is simply a great restaurant. Have always had a good ""complete"" experience every time I have gone. The atmosphere is nice and on a warm evening to sit outside is an enjoyable plus. Service is exceptional and food is innovative and appealing - a good range of choices without being too much to choose from."
May 19, 2010|Providence's upper quality|5|Providence's upper quality range. Appetizers: fettucini with lobster & crab meat in rich parmesan butter sauce; very nice fried calamari w/ crispy graham cracker breading & three sauces, incl. a spicy tartar variant and ponzu (interesting touch). Both $14 and outstanding. Entree: Buttery soft, perfect medium-rare Filet mignon, soft whipped potatoes, & fantastic ginger-caramel emulsion ($34, generous portion, no charge for split plates). Dessert: pot of white & dark mousse (perfectly textured) in chocolate shell ($10). Very generous pours of wines by the glass, small tastes to help me choose, reasonably priced (bottle list is extensive but expensive). Waiter was misinformed about one wine (Mosel vs. Aussie Riesling), otherwise grea

Everything was delightful. The menu had changed a bit since our last visit, but there were many delicious choices. Can't wait to return.

Knowledgeable wait staff. Overall, very good. I've been at this restaurant on less busy nights and the service was better. I recommend this restaurant without hesitation.

You felt very special, the service was first rate, the food was next to none and the ambiance was awesome. Love, love, love Cafe Nuovo!

May 8, 2010|Cafe Nuovo is very consistent|4|Cafe Nuovo is very consistent in producing a delicious meal in a very pleasant setting. We went on a busy night right before Mother's Day so it was a bit noisier than in previous visits. The food was very good with a lot of interest specials on the menu. What's also good about them is that the menu change seasonally so there's always new choices to pick from.
May 4, 2010|The food was good in an otherwise|4|The food was good in an otherwise very quiet restaurant. We should have known it was going to be an off night when the valet wasn't there to park the car. The bar had some action, giving away to a largely empty restaurant. Our waiter(s) were quick with suggestions. The waiter(s) didn't establish a bond with us; it was as though a different person had to visit the table each time. The food was good - and was close to great. Overall, a thumbs up.

Was disappointed the restaurant did not come through this year. We ordered dessert on our own. The carrot cake napoleon (sp) was not at best. A little dry - need more cream cheese frosting.
April 10, 2010|The experience was just ok.|3|The experience was just ok. For special occassions my husband and I found that we would prefer to got to Capital Grille or Trattoria Romana. The disappointing thing here is - we noted it was an anniversary and requested a table by the window. Not only were we not seated at the window - we were seated in the center of bench seating with folks seated to our immediate left and right. I find this seating very distasteful on all counts unless my party occupies the entire area....
April 10, 2010|New chef and new menu have|3|New chef and new menu have made me a bit sad. I think if I spend $200 on a meal for 2 it should be the best thing I have ever eaten and I should not be sitting an inch from the server stand. The food was good, but there are many, many place within walking distance that I can go to for good food, for $50-60 less and be just as happy.
April 4, 2010|It was way too loud in there|2|It was way too loud in there and we were sat right next to where are the wait staff hung out. Not worth the money at all. Our waiter had an attitude. My beef tenderloin was dry and mash potatoes had no flavor. Very disapointing. I thought it would be a great dining experience since I have dined at Cappricio's which is also owns Cafe Nuevo. I would reccomend going to Cappricio's instead if you want a great meal worth the money, first class service and great ambiance.

I made a call ahead and they put my boyfriends name on his dessert plate with ""Happy Birthday""...We had the special appetizer tarts, the flatbread that has apple on it, Rack of Lamb, Filet Mignon, and Bouillibase all highly recommended.This restaurant is consistent and a mainstay of Providence. There are so many feaux trendy places out there, this place is solid."
