ays ago|First time, won't be last!|5|"Dined for the first time with my wife Saturday night. Capriccio is an interesting place. Growing up across the river in Seekonk, it has always been a legendary place imbued with a certain mystique that made it almost unapproachable. In the 25 years or so that we've been going out to dinner on Federal Hill or around Providence, it never even occurred to me to go there for some reason. Decided to try it for her birthday and SOOO glad we did. The veal I had was paper thin and delicious. Her chicken was amazing. The soft mozzarella appetizer special was melt in your mouth. Portions were not huge, but the quality was wonderful. Our server wasn't the most polished server in the world but it all just added to the ambiance. It was a total throw back to how I picture Providence in the '80's. The menu is diverse which we appreciated since many of the high quality local restaurants seem to have much more limited options. Perhaps most surprising was the price. I was expecting to be bowled over by how expensive it would be and, instead, it was completely commensurate with other high quality local establishments. Not ""cheap"" by any means, but very very reasonable for the quality and location. Loved it. Will definitely be back, probably frequently. Only regret is that we waited so long to try it."
February 20, 2016|VERY NICE DINNING|4|GREAT RESTAURANT SERVICE ON TOP OF THE GAME ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THAT WE ORDERED A MEAL TO BE COOKED BY OUR TABLE AND IT WAS COOKED AWAY SO IT WAS VERY HARD TO SEE. EVEN THOUGH TABLES ARE TIGHT IT SEEMED OUR MEAL WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT COOKED BY THE TABLE. STILL WOULD RECOMMEND THE RESTAURANT AS IT HAS GREAT SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD .
February 19, 2016|Anniversary tradition|5|Our favorite anniversary celebration restaurant. We are never disappointed!
February 19, 2016|Nice restaurant for a special occasion!|4|The food was great, but a little pricey. Pretty large menu. Great restaurant for a special occasion. Very romantic atmosphere. The service was only okay, but I have dined here before with no problem. I think it was just a fluke. Would definitely recommend!

February 14, 2016|The Scent of an Italian meal|5|My wife and I spent Valentine's Day at Capriccio's. It was our first time at this fabulous restaurant and we were not disappointed. There are many good Italian restaurants in the Providence area but Capriccio's is arguably one of the best. My wife had saltimbocca alla Vincenzo and I had lobster cardinal. To be honest, I have never seen my wife eat so much and the lobster was succulent and the cream sauce was very light and flavourful. We shared the chocolate mousse as a dessert and had a couple of drinks each. Total price $116. But the experience was priceless. We are definitely coming back in the near future, even though we live an hour away.
February 13, 2016|Sadly Disappointed|2|"We were so excited to try this restaurant for Valentine's Day after hearing how beautiful and romantic it is, and how good the food is. Unfortunately, our experience did not match up with those reviews. We were never greeted when we walked in, our champagne was not ONCE poured for us after it was opened, our appetizers took an hour, our dinner came out an hour after that, our ""tableside"" flambe was instead done three tables over behind a pole, the ice cream that we ordered with it came out after we were already done, and our server never ONCE asked how our food was. If not for the ambiance of the restaurant, I would have said our Vday dinner was ruined. Thankfully the interior kept us distracted enough to get us through our letdown, 3 hour meal."
February 13, 2016|Capriccio is one of my favorite restaurants, but|4|Capriccio is one of my favorite restaurants, but this night everyone seemed extra busy and not on their A-game. I love the Steak Diane, but it was undercooked for my liking. I like mine well. I saw red when I cut it. I ate half of it (around the edges) and wanted to take the rest home since it is a large piece. The waiter had it wrapped and said he would send it to my car. I asked how he knew what car was mine, he said they are good at guessing that. Well, my half steak, which is worth about $20.00 since the steak goes for almost $40.00, was not in my car when we left. They technically owe me a steak dinner!
February 13, 2016|2/13/16|5|I had never been to Capriccio's before and my wife and I were thoroughly satisfied! Waitstaff, Maitre' D, Flambe' gentleman, and management were all attentive and made sure we had a super time!
February 12, 2016|Dinner at Capriccios|5|We arrived early, took advantage of the bar and it is a quaint area. We were seated promptly at 7:00pm and had a wonderful dinner experience. The waiter was polite, knowledgeable and was quickly to add his recommendations when asked. Everything ordered from appetizers to our main course and dessert were outstanding. This truly one of our favorite dinning pleasures.
February 6, 2016|fabulous time out|5|The food was wonderful. Our waiter was great and new all about the wines. My beef wellington was cooked to perfection. I can say enough about what a great time I had. My wife and I will. Even going back many times we think we have found our new Providence dinner spot
January 31, 2016|Pre-theatre dinner|3|Much better than the last time we dined here before the theatre.
January 30, 2016|Absolutely the best!!!!  Food is always ...|5|Absolutely the best!!!! Food is always incredible. My Favorite restaurant

It was very busy and unfortunately our table was located near the kitchen entrance and it was a constant traffic jam. My fault for not asking to be moved. The owners son was extremely rude to some of his waitstaff and we heard more than we really wanted to. Other negative is the wine list is VERY pricey. Overall the food was great so we will go back
January 30, 2016|Overall amazing experience|5|Overall amazing experience
January 29, 2016|Lovely dining experience|5|We celebrated a friends birthday here and were so pleased with everything. The atmosphere is elegant and romantic with a unique vintage flair. They were very accommodating to our seating preference and did some rearranging so we could enjoy a table near the fireplace. We had a great server and the food was impeccable. I plan on going again very soon for no special occasion, just because it was fantastic!
January 26, 2016|Delicious spot before we went to PPAC!|5|This was a delicious spot before we enjoyed seeing Cabaret at PPAC. The limo service was an added bonus to bring us directly from Capriccio to PPAC before and after the show. They had great service and left a great impression.
January 22, 2016|Excellent restaurant week experience.  I...|4|"Excellent restaurant week experience. I have found that several restaurants provide skimpy portions when ordering from the restaurant week menu, but this was not the case with Capriccio. Everything was well prepared and portions were consistent with the everyday Capriccio experience. It's an ""old school"" vibe, but definitely worth a visit."
January 22, 2016|Always Wonderful|5|I've been going to Capriccio's since 1975 and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is so romantic and the waitstaff is very knowledgeable about wine and food. There were many yummy choices during Providence Restaurant Week and we were never rushed. Capriccio's is one of a few places that I can always count on to have great food and a great time!
January 22, 2016|The entire experience was just lovely; great staff|5|We had a perfect table, perfect waitstaff, perfect meal. The ambiance was delightful and the staff was especially happy and knowledgeable. The menu was extensive and the specials just delicious. We will go there again, often..
January 22, 2016|Great Italian Dinner and Ambiance|5|"My wife and I ate dinner on Friday evening. I have eaten dinner here many, many times and it never disappoints. The appetizers and dinner selections are broad and all are delicious! The chef will specialize almost any dinner to your liking! We shared a ""special of the day"" hot app and had dinner and drinks. The atmosphere is low key and elegant. The service was also excellent. Great night out for dinner and would recommend to everyone."
January 18, 2016|Excellent|5|Had the surf and turf prime rib. It was cooked to perfection. Ambiance was great. Highly recommend.
January 16, 2016|FrUit flys everywhere|4|FrUit flys everywhere
January 15, 2016|Server|5|Our server was very friendly and nice. We had a great time!
January 9, 2016|Favorite Date Night|5|This is one of my wife and mine's favorite date night restaurant. The wait staff are friendly and accommodating. No one rushes you and the food is unbelievably delicious.
December 31, 2015|Good evening!|4|Although it was New Years Eve ar 5:00, our waiter really rushed us at the beginning. Enzo, the Maitre D, was great with tableside stuff. The waiter brought the wrong sauce for my rack of lamb. The veal Oscar was a bit non traditional. The ambiance is wonderful. The food was very good. Maybe they wanted to turn the tables on what was to be a very busy night, but all in all...it was good...albeit, a bit rushed.
December 26, 2015|Classic|5|Capriccio is a Classic RI restaurant it never disappoints. T. It is a go to place for special occasions the food has been consistent for years .
December 22, 2015|35 years of outstanding dining....|5|35 years of outstanding dining....
December 12, 2015|Best Italian Restaurant|5|I love Italian food and I rate this restaurant #1 in the Rhode Island area Great food and dynamite service and the only restaurant that still does table side cooking Steak Diane table side is outstanding and Cherries Jubilee is the best dessert
December 9, 2015|One of Rhode Islands Finest|5|We were greeted by coat check and Maître d' on the spot. The food order went in quick and easy. Tableside service is such a nice touch I recommend Shrimp Gino, the Steak Diane and the Crepes. The environment is warm and authentic. Next time you visit Providence Rhode Island be sure to check out Capriccio. Five Star Experience for a Three Star Price.
November 28, 2015|Excellent dinner with friends!|5|The food and the service was impeccable! Always a favorite!
November 27, 2015|Fabulous Dinning!|5|We have been coming here for 23 years, as a matter fact 1st date was here 23 years ago and it was our anniversary on the 26th we try to make it in as close to that date every year. The food is to die for and the atmosphere is romantic it is just all class all the way around. We look forward to our next vist!!! Highly recommend the best dinning in the state!!!
November 20, 2015|A Royal Anniversary|5|Having my 23rd anniversary at Capriccio's was an experience of royalty. Everything about it was 5 STAR. Had the special, Black Sea Bass. Husband had Steak Diane, it was melt in your mouth perfect. I especially love the building, all the nooks and crannies. May have to host an event there sometime.

November 14, 2015|Delicious|5|I came here specifically for the beef Wellington and wasn't disappointed. Everything we got was delicious. You pay for it but it was worth it.
November 13, 2015|excellent ambiance for a romantic evening.|5|The wait staff was incredibly friendly, helpful and professional. The pace of the restaurant was not rushed in the least. The food was incredible. One of the most romantic dining spots in New England. The price is in line with the food/service. An incredible wine list, a bit pricey, but the presentation was outstanding.
November 13, 2015|As always Wonderful|5|As we knew before we went the meal, atmosphere and service would be exceptional. From the valet on the street to everyone you have contact with the service is excellent. The food is always delicious, the specials are always good and the regular menu items are always delicious. The dessert menu is so so good. The wine list always has a wonderful array of yummy wines. We just love the service, from the matrade who checks on you to the servers you cannot want for a thing. And to boot its the epitome of class but with a very relaxed atmosphere. Cannot say enough about this wonderful restaurant, cannot wait to dine again . Yum Yum Yum!
November 10, 2015|Great Restaurant|4|This Rhode Island institution is a mainstay in the Providence restaurant scene. The food was prepared perfectly and the service, impeccable. My only criticism, and the reason why I cannot give this place a five-star overall rating is because we were constantly beseiged by fruitflies as we tried to eat. We swatted them away and they persisted in ruining what otherwise would have been a wonderful experience. I sincerely hope that this matter is addressed.
Dined on November 8, 2015|Quality and customer service is outstand...|5|Quality and customer service is outstanding!
November 7, 2015|Wonderful even though we had a baby in a stroller!|5|This was an absolutely fabulous dining experience. We arrived with a party of four and a baby in a stroller. There was a short delay, but after less than ten minutes we were seated in a very private dining room. It was amazing - everyone, from the maitre de to the bus person treated adults and child as family, showing us pictures of theit children and grandchildren, making us feel so welcome. The food was superb. I live in an area known for its fine restaurants, but this was the best meal and overall dining experience in 20 years. Waterfire, then a fabulous dinner - an incredible, special experience!
November 7, 2015|consistant|5|been dining here for years and the meal is always excellent and service exceptional! Highly recommend for a night out at PPAC. They have a wonderful pre-performace pre-fix menu that is extremely reasonable. Check it out!
November 6, 2015|Old Favorite|3|Cappricio's is great. Why I can only give the 3 stars is because the food was the pricest in town but not the Best in town. It was very, very, good, but at those prices, you have to be the best. People have to love the taste of each bite so much that they stop and think Wow - now this is great ! I Love the Ambiance - Old Providence. I will go back again, because it is iconic, but won't get any of the pricier dishes.
November 6, 2015|The Wait for the Food was Interminable|1|I've dined at Capriccio's for 25 years, often bringing out-of-towners to enjoy the ambience, good food and excellent service. Our party of four came on Friday November 6 at 7:00pm. This time the service was really off. The courses came out with great lapses in time. The wait was interminable. Further, no one came by to check on us. The manager was nowhere in sight. Even when we got up to leave, there was no one to speak to. We'd hoped to impress our guests, but this was not the case. Perhaps the restaurant simply had an off night. But in the future I'll make reservations elsewhere.
November 5, 2015|My friends and I thoroughly loved Capriccios!|5|Before going to the Providence Performing Arts Theater, five of us had a fabulous Pre-Fixe dinner at Cappricios! They valet parked our car and gave us a limo ride to the theater! What fun we had!!!
October 31, 2015|Great meal, as always!|5|We always feel special at Capriccio's - terrific wines, great apps (stuffed squid and stuffed zucchini flowers) and incredible meals - our server Robert was excellent, attentive, helpful and funny. Love this Providence gem!
October 24, 2015|Great Dinner!|5|Enjoyed an early Dinner with my Wife and Son. Excellent service by Joseph and the food was superb.
October 23, 2015|Good food but overpriced|3|The service was top notch from the valet to the waiters - the wine list is extensive but about 50% more per bottle when compared to other area restaurants. The entrees, salads and appetizers were really good just a bit under what's expected at this price point. The desserts were a disaster - tasted and looked like they just came out of a very long stay in the freezer
October 22, 2015|Classic Providence|5|Hadn't been to Capriccio in years (don't know why not). Everything at lunch was great. Food and service were spectacular. Attention to detail was best exemplified by the fact that several appetizers were ordered to split and the staff split them out on individual plates so nobody had to pass the plates around.
October 17, 2015|Impeccable Service!|4|My husband and I decided to have dinner at Capriccio before heading up to the PPC. Our server Nick, was very impressive with his knowledge of the menu and the never ending list of specials! He did not even have to pause when reciting them to us. The service at Capriccio was amazing. We were highly impressed with all of the waitstaff as well as what we assumed were managers. Our dinners were excellent also. I had the scallops with risotto and it was the tastiest risotto ever. My husband had the veal and said it was very good. Although we live in Boston, next time we are in the Providence area we will definitely be back!
October 10, 2015|Amazing food, exceptional service|5|Both the food and service were exceptional. Quiet atmosphere,great setting.
October 9, 2015|The service was horrible|2|The service was horrible and the food was not worth the money that you pay.
October 5, 2015|Good|4|Lovely atmosphere & food was good but unable to substitute caesar salad even for upcharge. Not many gluten free options. The couple at the next table got more attention than we did (3 women alcohol free)
October 3, 2015|It was mine and my sweetheart's first ex...|5|It was mine and my sweetheart's first experience dining at Cappricio's . We had chosen the date for my birthday, service was great and the food (which I had a sea bass that was on special and he had the Lobster Cardinale ) was out of this world. The only negative thing I have to say is that the restaurant is way too loud for the ambiance, but other than that it was incredible. I will tell everyone that I know to try it out at least once!
October 3, 2015|Perfect  (as usual)|5|Capriccio is perfect! I visit a few times a year and have never been disappointed. From the valets to dessert it is the perfect dining experience. They do anything needed to satisfy your needs. (I go to Capriccio every year on my birthday because it's the best)
October 2, 2015|Not what I thought|3|Started with terrible valet attendents who were very rude, so right from the get go we were not happy. Went to the lounge & service was not good , we get treated better in other restaurants who seem happy you are there . this is the only time I have left a neg review . good was very good and wait staff was also very professional. Overall our experience was not as I expected from such a great restaurant ...so I thought ....I'll take andinos any day over this place.
October 2, 2015|Truly enjoyed the food, atmosphere and s...|4|"Truly enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service. Still a great""go to"" spot!"
September 26, 2015|Service not as good|3|Bartender Lisa makes a good drink but is lacking in social skills. The other bartenders were quietly doing their jobs, very pleasant. Lisa was racing around needlessly with a sour disposition. The restaurant was very busy, our waiter (baldish guy) can't recall his name, was very good when he finally got to us. The food was delicious per usual.
September 26, 2015|Great food, unfortunate service|3|Amazing food, but sub-standard service in light of previous experiences and recommendations.
September 26, 2015|Waiter|4|We loved our waiter, Larry. He was funny and entertaining. The food came out perfect. He wasn't overwhelming. You could tell he had years of experience, very professional. I would ask for him the next time we stop in.
September 26, 2015|Disappointed for the second time at Capricio's|3|I had a reunion luncheon in the afternoon and wanted something light ~ so I ordered shrimp scampi over capellini. The pasta was stuck together and tasteless so that no matter how much salt or cheese was added, it was still too bland. The shrimp also had no taste except it was even worse because it tasted as if it was water logged. There was no garlic and it was awful !!! When I was asked if I enjoyed my meal, my companion said that I did not and he offered to make me the same dish table side, but by that time, we would have been late for the Philharmonic concert. I was so terribly disappointed in Capriccio :(
September 21, 2015|Nice place|4|Good food. Great service. Cool dark dining room and bar.
September 20, 2015|Disappointed|2|Have dinned here many times and was always impressed but disappointed during the most recent visit. There were six in our party for dinner prior to the theatre. Some ordered off the prefixe menu and some off the regular menu. The food was extremely slow from the kitchen and when it arrived the fish was over cooked as was the veal parm. Our waiter offered to replace or substitute but as we were almost late to the theatre, we had to decline. I will try again in the hopes that this night was just a fluke.
September 19, 2015|Not bad, but not impressed either|2|The ambiance and wine menu were the two best features of this restaurant. The food was not bad but for the price of each dish I was expecting better tasting food. The starter salad was below average and not flavorful, two bites is all we took from this salad before deciding it wasn't great. Too much salad dressing and the vegetables were not crunchy or having flavor. We had the ricotta gnocchi and pollo Romana, neither were anything special and we did not finish them. I would say the taste was more of an Olive Garden than a fine dining establishment. I would not go back or recommend this to a friend.
September 19, 2015|Wonderful|4|This restaurant was amazing. My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful night. The employees act like you're family it's so nice. We loved the food and loved the service, definitely will go again.
September 19, 2015|This former carriage house has the charm...|5|This former carriage house has the charm and history of Old Providence. A delight for both the eyes and the palate.
September 18, 2015|Always Perfect...|5|We go to Capriccios for most special occasions and are never disappointed. Food is great, service is fantastic and the dinning room area is comfortable. One of the Best restaurants in RI...
September 18, 2015|Good as ever!|5|The dining experience was, as always, perfect. From the parking valets to the maitre d to our server, Don.
September 18, 2015|A restaurant for all occasions|5|If your looking for a romantic place for that special person for a special occasion this is definitely in contention. Perhaps you are looking for a place To host a private party or business luncheons. They have a few private rooms perfect for parties of 15 to 40 people. Authentic Italian cuisine. Fabulous wine list. Great service. It is no wonder that Capriccio has withstood the test of time. It's one of our favorite places to dine!
September 12, 2015|This restaurant is in a class of its own|5|This restaurant has it all. The food, wait service and atmosphere is second to none. Valet parking makes it convenient. I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion, as it is expensive.
September 10, 2015|A real Gem|5|I have been several times and they never cease to amaze. The service makes you feel like a king, and the food is fit for one.
September 6, 2015|1st time Providence visitor|5|"So glad we found this wonderful venue online. Excellent wine and menu choices made the reservation decision easy. They were busy but accommodated us immediately and made us feel very pampered. Our blonde server was very helpful with menu choices, any questions, and just overall care. Wonderful wine choice and food was magnificent in presentation and flavors. ""Wow"" factor. We even stayed and shared wonderful white chocolate crème brulee, another Wow! Loved the atmosphere and décor. Brick and stone walls, lighting and covered brick flooring very unique and perfect for ambiance. So glad we found this treasure, would love to visit again. The other server who also checked in on us was very congenial and witty, he and our main server, made the evening a truly a pleasure."
August 31, 2015|Same As Always~ Ab~Fab~U~Lissss!!|5|Our Server was Mario , Please say Thank You from the Ranieri ~ Family . Great night together
August 29, 2015|Excellent Dining Experience!!|5|We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Attentive service, wonderful food, and great ambiance. Great wine recommendation too. Will definitely go again!
August 28, 2015|A terrific dinner|5|We were a party of 8, three generations and have a lot of fun. The wine, a Masi Ameretto was perfect, the Kobe Carpaccio outstanding and every enjoyed their meal. A great spot in Providence, see you next year we are back to Europe
August 22, 2015|Attention to Detail Superb|5|"My husband and I were dining for his birthday -- I had made a small notation of ""Birthday Dinner"" on the reservation with no other mention of it that evening. When our desserts were brought over by our waiter -- he had placed a candle in the dessert and sang Happy Birthday to my husband! Also, our leftovers (take home) were brought to our car so that we would not have to carry them to the lounge (for an after dinner drink) after dinner."
August 22, 2015|The food was just not good. I was excite...|2|"The food was just not good. I was excited to try this ""classic"" Providence restaurant, and myself and my out of towner guests were all disappointed. Just not good Italian! The custard dessert was like a jello jiggler molded in the bottom of a solo cup, unacceptable. Service was good, but food was very forgettable or memorable...memorable in that it was so undesirable remember not to go back😣"
August 14, 2015|Excellent|5|This was my second visit to this amazing restaurant. The first time was 2 years ago when I interviewed for my current job. I told myself then that this was a place to take my wife on a special occasion.
August 11, 2015|Anniversary Celebration|5|Went to dinner to celebrate anniversary. Everything was wonderful, James, our waiter, was knowledgable, courteous , and helpful, with the correct blend of attentiveness without hovering. Food was delicious, properly served and good variety. A great evening!
Dined on August 7, 2015|Wine is ridiculously priced.|4|Wine is ridiculously priced. Same bottle I get at another lovely restauarant for $26.00 was $42.00 at Capriccio. Food was excellent. Service is superb!
July 22, 2015|Disappointing|3|Dined at Capriccio during Providence Restaurant Week with friends. We felt rushed and thought our server was condescending because all four of us ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. He hurried us along almost to get our meal quickly finished and the next guests seated. The food was fine, but not so outstanding as to make it worth going back again. We have dined there many times in the past and were very disappointed in the service. There were many waiters literally rushing around and making for a lot of distraction and background noise. Sad to see this restaurant not meet our expectations.
July 22, 2015|The service was exceptional. Entrees and...|4|The service was exceptional. Entrees and appetizers from a well-rounded menu were nicely prepared. Only complaint; lobster is overpriced.
July 22, 2015|Perfect restaurant week choice|5|Descending the steps into Cappriccio , we entered an unexpected restaurant of days gone by. Excellent value for Restaurant week choices. Portions were very ample, presentation thoughtful, wait staff efficient and attentive. Space beautifully appointed, and comfortable. And the wine list goes on forever! check it out!
July 18, 2015|My favorite place|5|My favorite restaurant in Providence. Excellent service and food.
July 17, 2015|My New Favorite|5|Outstanding! Everything from the high back chairs in the dining room to the amazing menu of expertly prepared dishes places this restaurant a cut above everything else in Providence. I'll be visiting until I've tried every dish on the menu. If you are looking for a restaurant that has a menu of delicious items you can only get in that 1 place, then visit Capriccio. The service is incredible, the staff is friendly, and the dining room is beautiful.
July 17, 2015|Perfect from start to finish.|5|First class service, staff and food. Extensive wine list and knowledgeable servers. Would certainly return and recommend.
July 16, 2015|First time there . we had the salmon and...|5|First time there . we had the salmon and the veal parm . Both dishes were delicious
July 15, 2015|Restaurant Week|5|We are not native Rhode Islanders so restaurant week serves as a good motivator to try new restaurants. Capriccio did not disappoint and excelled in all areas. Immediately upon entering, the appealing décor put us at ease. A nice host explained the building while seating us. Our waiter was wonderful. Other reviews seem to hint that if you ordered off the restaurant week menu you were not treated the same. This could not be farther from the truth on this evening. We were pleasantly pampered. Both our dishes, scallops and eggplant were very good as were the appetizers and deserts. We finished a moderately priced bottle of wine and two coffees and the tab was very reasonable. The menu prices would have added 10 or 15 percent to the bill but I think well worth it in the future. We dine out quite often and this will not be our every night place but they can count on return visits.
July 15, 2015|Still a classic|4|I haven't been in over 20 years and it was a wonderful welcome back after such a long time. I'm not sure how much of the interior has been updated in the 20 or so years since my last visit, but the food, service and ambiance all aimed for perfection and came very close to it. Cocktails were very well done, menu for restaurant week was a steal and the service was excellent. While there are certainly newer and potentially better offerings out there (you might be hard to find the latter), there's a reason why it's been here for almost 40 years. Definitely a Providence legend and I'll be back a lot quicker next time.
July 2, 2015|Never disappointed.|5|Always enjoy our special occasions at Capriccio's. Outstanding food, superior service (love Michael) and food preparation at your table - what more can you ask for? A true gem.
June 27, 2015|The dining experience was superb however...|5|The dining experience was superb however the bartender needs to learn how to be more friendly and cheerful.
June 20, 2015|Excellent, waiter Robert was the best....|5|Very nice, great food, great service, little pricey but worth it...
June 20, 2015|Excellent Service, Atmosphere & Food|5|This is our 3rd time eating here and we look forward to going back in the near future. The food is fresh and amazing. The service is impeccable. The waiters wear tuxedos. They offer free valet parking which makes it easy. It's downstairs and not handicap accessible (from what I understand, I didn't see an elevator). Excellent choice for a special ocassion or to impress someone!
June 19, 2015|special celebration|5|We were celebrating a 25th wedding anniversary with friends. I called that day to ask for a special table. We arrived to a beautiful table set off to the side. The service was fantastic, as always, the food was wonderful, consistently excellent, and the service was hard to beat. Thankfully, the noise level was low. It was a very special night indeed. Can't wait to return!
June 17, 2015|The best in Providence|5|I have been dining at Capriccio since it opened in the mid-70s. The service is is impeccable from the parking valets to the servers and hosts. This time we went to celebrate my daughter's 14th birthday. I suspect she'll never go anywhere else to eat again! Of course the food was as always, imaginative and delicious!
June 17, 2015|Fantastico!|5|Our party of 5 completely enjoyed our Capriccio experience, it became a special occasion for all of us-not just the birthday girl. The service was attentive without being over powering. The food was classic Italian and beautifully plated. There was not only an ample variety on the menu, they had additional daily specials. I had a caper/olive pan seared haddock that melted in your mouth with yummy perfectly cooked green beans. Reports from everyone were that their dishes were tasty. We had called ahead and talked with Barbara, we had bubbles waiting. They prepared a beautiful collection of appetizers we all shared. We celebrated the birthday girl with a cake. Timing was perfect on everything, we never felt rushed but also not forgotten. Capriccio made a special event even more special than we could have hoped for!
June 9, 2015|We found the restaurant extremely nice|5|We went there for our anniversary. Extremely nice restraurant for a quite dinner for a special evening out.
June 7, 2015|Food was impeccable  but the service was slow.|3|We have been dining at Capriccio's for years, and we have never experienced such slow service. The restaurant was far from full, and we sat for almost two hours before our meals were served. It took quite some time to get one of our appetizers and then the oysters were served almost 10 minutes after that appetizer. Everything was delicious, but the service was lacking. When we were leaving the restaurant, the host was on the telephone, with what appeared to be a personal call, and did not acknowledge us leaving. If this was our first time dining here, we would not return based on the service.
June 3, 2015|OK Food - Poor Service|3|"The food here is always good. Never great or inspiring. Service is typically good but this time around it was not. Server was terribly inexperienced. Simple things you expect to be right at this caliber of restaurant just were't. (ex: red wine glasses were brought for champagne. Wrong champagne brought out originally.) Also.. the restaurant has some sad, store bought excuse for their ""anniversary/birthday"" complimentary cake they bring to the table. Skip this place and try Camille's for that same ""feel."" It's a better experience all around."
May 24, 2015|Old & Tired|1|Perfect example of a establishment resting on its prior reputation. From start to finish everything was less than mediocre. Worst Martini ever, glass not cold gin warm. Veal was over cooked, pasta was undercooked and the Cherries Jubilee, not sure why they bothered, cheap brandy, and melted ice cream. Was a total disappointment and will not return or recommend to anyone. The only positive note was that our server did a great job.
May 24, 2015|Wonderful dining experience!|4|Wonderful dining experience!
May 10, 2015|Staff are attentive and willing to help|5|Great food, great atmosphere and a wine list that is outstanding.
May 10, 2015|A warm welcomed greeting followed by a q...|5|"A warm welcomed greeting followed by a quiet, enjoyable, delicious dinner with service that is second to none are just some of the words that cross my mind when I describe our last visit to Capriccio's on Mother's Day. A true ""go to"" restaraunt that continues to prove itself a staple of Providence."
May 9, 2015|Our waiter was very good and efficient  ...|5|Our waiter was very good and efficient went over the specials the restaraunt was very romantic I would recommend to a friend
April 25, 2015|Not a religious experience|4|Came highly recommended and it was good. But , for the high cost (and a half empty restaurant) I need more then a colorful description of the specials. Service was not what I would expect.
April 18, 2015|The most romantic place we have ever been .|5|The service is the best we have had in a long time glad we made the choice and prices are very reasonable for the portions of food..
April 12, 2015|Outstanding|5|Outstanding food. Excellent service. The best resturant experience we have had in a very long time
April 8, 2015|Quite nice|4|Good Italian cuisine, interesting menu, pleasant atmosphere, excellent service. But the prices on the real menu are almost $10 per entree higher than those listed on the Open Table menu.
March 16, 2015|The food and service is always outstandi...|5|The food and service is always outstanding. The haddock special was phenomenal and the special salad makes you want to get back soon to order it again.
March 11, 2015|Not quite worth the $$|3|"We selected this place because of its 4 star reviews even though they came with 4 star prices. The service was excellent and our appetizer was lovely. Our entrees, however, were mediocre at best. The ""fresh"" pappardelle was overly thick, mealy and undercooked ( and I don't mean al dente!) and our veal was like leather. For context, I have never met a plate of pasta that I didn't like but this plate I did not finish. We may yet give them another chance but, for the price, there are quite a few other restaurants deserving of a spot on our list to try ahead of a return to Capriccios."
March 7, 2015|Romantic/Special Occasion/Amazing Food|5|We came here before we went to see a show at the Providence Performing Arts. It's our 3rd time here and it was just as good as the first two times! We absolutely love it here. The atmosphere is quiet and romantic. The waiters are in tuxedos. It's very, very good. We are going again for my husband's birthday. They make a cherries jubilee right by the table with the fire and all. Very impressive.
March 3, 2015|Outstanding|5|We had a great experience on a Tuesday night, the food was outstanding and the service was perfection. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion!
February 28, 2015|Always a solid favorite .great wine list...|4|Always a solid favorite .great wine list, great menu selection and service from door to table and back.
February 28, 2015|Throwback to an earlier era.|5|Tuxedo clad wait staff, unhurried atmosphere (we arrived at 6:15 and departed after 8 pm). Beef Wellington, Cherries Jubilee, lovely wine selection, knowledgeable and oh so polite wait staff. Pricey but worth it for that special occasion (in this case 28th anniversary).
February 26, 2015|Outstanding!|5|My friends and I were pampered and we loved it! Our car was valet parked. The waitstaff, especially Larry, was attentive and fun, and the food we had from the pre-fixe menu was outstanding! To top it all off, we were treated to a complimentary limo ride to the theater and then picked up afterward!
February 16, 2015|Marilyn|4|Since it was a Monday night, it was not too crowded. The food was prepared to our liking. The wait staff appeared a bit harried. We had to ask for bread. However in trying to decide between two wine the server brought over both wines to sample. The meal included salad or pasta but when my husband asked if he could have Caesar instead of house, he was told he could but was charged full salad price. Overall the prices were appropriate for the quality and quantity of food. Definitely would dine there again.
February 13, 2015|Excellent|5|Staff very well versed in the menu and the food is very good with good portions. The ambiance is the main attraction here as a very classy and upscale restaurant. Perfect for special nights out, or even as a regular place to go (if you can afford to). Its not overly priced for the area, but will still set you back alittle.
February 13, 2015|Still perfect after all these years!|5|I have been dining at Capriccio since it opened in the late '70s. The service and food is always excellent, from the greetings of the valets right onward. The coat check, the wait staff, the maitre d and the flambé chef are all cordial and warm. The food is always beyond delicious.
February 7, 2015|love the ambience, service is wonderful ...|4|love the ambience, service is wonderful and the food was above average!
Dined on January 31, 2015|Pleasantly Surprised|4|I had not been to Capriccio's in years..always felt it was overrated and expensive. I was pleasantly surprised. Meal was spectacular and the price was not an issue to the quality and amount of food that was served. Looking forward to returning to the restaurant soon.
January 28, 2015|35 years later - same great experience!|5|I proposed to my wife at Capriccio's 35 years ago and as we had tickets to Fleetwood Mac in Prov decided to revisit to see if the charm was still there. I am happy to report that our experience Wednesday night was better than I recall 35 years ago and that experience was outstanding. Service was exemplary, with a waiter who seemed to know what we wanted before we did:) A definite recommend and we certainly won't wait that long to visit again! Providence isnt that far from Boston:) If you have a special night coming up Capriccio's is the place to spend it! Cheers!
January 25, 2015|Great service and ambiance....awful food.|2|clams had no flavor and were full of sand. steak undercooked. old oil was used in the fryolator. Tomato sauce tasted like ragu.
January 23, 2015|what's better than that?|5|I have nothing but great things to say about Capriccio.
January 21, 2015|Old World Elegance|3|Just a great dinning experience. Best service around. I've had the good fortune to eat at many fine restaurants and this one never disappoints. I want to credit the fantastic wait staff who go above and beyond with everything they do.
January 21, 2015|Not truthfull|2|We went for the lunch prix fix as noted on open table but did not get the menu. When my husband asked for it they said it was only offered at dinner. We informed them we did see it advertised for lunch and they insisted this was not the case. So it defeated the purpose in going. I called when I got home to complain and told them it is still on the open table site but they could not be bothered! Extremely disappointed! We really could only afford the prix fix lunch but we're mislead by open table.
January 19, 2015|Excellent night all around|5|This was our first visit to Capriccio. It had a wonderful reputation to live up to and it delivered in spades. From the elegant atmosphere, the attentive service to the food, it was an excellent night.
January 18, 2015|Excellent all around|5|Great service from valet, to seating, to staff. Food and wine list were top notch. Great place to splurge on a special occasion or celebrating someone.
January 17, 2015|This restaurant has been consistently te...|5|This restaurant has been consistently terrific for so many years. Great food, wine and service! Never a disappointment.
January 13, 2015|Good. Not Great|4|Food was good and so was the service. Nothing wowed us though. Providence is a great food city and this place needs to catch up with the times. It was restaurant week, (which we did not participate in) yet it was still very slow.
January 12, 2015|Capriccio For Restaurant Week|4|I attended Capriccio for restaurant week with 3 good friends and we all enjoyed the experience. The high-end Italian fare was all prepared beautifully. The portions were adequate if not a bit large. The wine list only was available for bottles and half bottles, however. Since I was dining with friends, some would have preferred white, some would have preferred red based on entree selection- and there was no option to purchase by the glass. Since we all had to drive, we did not want to consume more than a glass each. As a result, we had to miss out on pairing wine with our meals, which would have added to the experience.
January 12, 2015|This restaurant is wonderful place to go...|5|This restaurant is wonderful place to go when you want to go for a romantic dining experience where the high caliber wait-people respond to your wishes without being over bearing and the Italian cuisine is unusual but extremely good
December 30, 2014|38 years|5|That's how long I have been dining at Capriccio. The service, food and atmosphere has been perfect.
December 27, 2014|Not What we Expected|3|We were hoping for more of a true Italian restaurant when we chose this one for our holiday gathering. The Pasta dishes were very few and overall it was pricier than expected. We would go back to one on Federal Hill next time. Loved the area of the city this is in though and the bartender was great, very friendly and helpful.
December 26, 2014|Special|5|"Capriccio's is our ""go to"" restaurant for special occasions as the food and service NEVER disappoint. Dining there is a wonderful experience as you savor each course in a relaxing time frame reminiscent of dining in Italy where a meal is an experience. The servers are always close by and never intrusive which makes for a perfect blend!"
December 21, 2014|One of the best restaurants in Providence.|5|This is a family staple for us. If you want an old school Italian dining experience, this is the place. It is not inexpensive but have NEVER had a bad meal and it is one of the most memorable restaurants you will ever experience.
December 19, 2014|Fire alarm ruined experience|1|I took my boyfriend to Capriccio this past Friday to celebrate his birthday. I made reservations a month in advance and was very excited to take him here. We heard it was the best providence restaurant. The night had potential- good food, good service, night atmosphere. However the atmosphere quickly was ruined when the fire alarm proceeded to go off 3 times during our meal for a duration of 30 minutes. Although our food was delicious, we expected some type of discount for the fire alarm ruining our experience. However nothing was compped and we paid full price. In my eyes this was terrible customer service, and although I couldve asked and complained for a discount, it shouldve been automatic. We will not be back to this restaurant in the future.
December 19, 2014|Very festive|4|Our lunch was very good. I would recommend Capriccio's for lunch. The food is always good. Our waiter Larry was very good.
December 8, 2014|Very Disappointed|2|"Reservation was noted ""3 generations celebrating a 75th birthday. Near the fireplace if possible"" Greeted by a man with no personality. No mention of request. Seated in the furthest corner of the restaurant near a serving station. Waited what seemed to be an unusually long time to be served. It was a Monday at lunchtime and the restaurant was not busy."
December 6, 2014|Very disappointed! We go here every year...|3|Very disappointed! We go here every year for a christmas party with our friends.We always request and make reservations in advance to sit in front near fireplace.Much to our dismay we were shuffled off to the farthest back room in the restaurant which honestly was the size of a closet.After us insisting we were not sitting there we were eventually sat in the front of the restaurant.We go there for the ambiance. We certainly would not have had that in the closet.
December 6, 2014|Office party|3|This is not the first time we had our small office party here. We were a party of 10 and Capriccio is one of the groups favorites. We are not kids, but you might have thought we were the way the waiter treated us initially. We had 2 waiters both younger than any in our group. The lead waiter was rude, insulting, and condescending not agreeing with how we wanted to order appetizers for the group. I actually had words with him and after that the other waiter took lead and serve was great. Food was very good, except the cannoli, which is usually good.
December 5, 2014|Cappricios for lunch!|4|This was the second year we chose to visit Capriccios for our holiday lunch. Last year had made such a great impression, we could not wait to get back there again. We were not disappointed by the food at all. We started with the Caprese Salad, which was out of this world. For lunch, three of us had the Beef Bourguignon Risotto and the fourth had the Meatball special. If I was to have any complaint was that the service was not as attentive as it was last year. Although the staff is extremely personable and knowledgeable, there were several times we requested refills on our cocktails and were forgotten. Although the water glasses stayed full. Definitely worth going their for the food and ambiance.
November 29, 2014|Our night at Capriccio's|3|Capriccio's is one of my wife's favorite spots. We live in MA and always go to Capriccio's for a special night. The waiters are also wonderful as they add to the experience with their food recommendations and they take the time to spoil you. Capriccio's is one of our favorites and is never disappointing. The ambience is always so nice and the decorating is tasteful and festive around the holidays. We love it. We also found the prices to be very good.
November 28, 2014|Quality of food|4|The food we had, Veal Parm that my husband had and the mussels zuppa were not up to Capriccio's normal standards. Is there a new chef? Sauce was very tomatoey!
November 28, 2014|Usually outstanding but not tonight|3|Have been here a number of times. Had an early reservation as we were going to the theater. We made this known to our waiter when we arrived. With 40 mins to the start of the show, we still did not have our meal. Each time we tried to call our waiter over he did not respond. We finally called another employee over and explained our concern.. He explained that there was a problem in the kitchen but our food would be out in time. Our meals arrived a few minutes later. The food was outstanding but we had to eat quickly and asked for the bill as soon as the plates were placed on the table. When we received out bill and again expressed our concern as to how long we waited, etc. Our waiter just kept saying it was a problem in the kitchen. Our concern and issue was that during the entire time we were waiting, he did not come over and explain this to us. He knew we we were going to a show, We even told him the time. The table next to us had the same issue. He did nothing to allay our concerns, explain what was going on, etc. We were very disappointed with the service and the lack of concern as to our comfort. The ambiance, food, location as always was wonderful but I would now think twice about going back to a place that had previously been a favorite.
November 22, 2014|DELICOUS!|5|We all had such a wonderful dinner. The food was amazing as well as the service..
November 21, 2014|Was somewhat disappointed this time.|4|While the meal was good, I was expecting exceptional. The scallops ordinarily are super tender and fresh. This time they were tough and the usual Capriccio taste was not there. This would not prevent me from going back because everything else was fabulous and I've been there often enough to know that this had to be just an off night.
November 19, 2014|Delicio|2|Ask for a veal parm on the bone and extra marinara sauce on the side. Not on the menu.
November 18, 2014|It was a fantastic experience !!!|5|It was a splendid meal, enjoyed by all in our party. The consensus - it was one of the best Italian dinners ever.
November 13, 2014|Excellent|5|The food, service and decor was excellent as it always is
November 8, 2014|Very good food but a few flaws|4|We have been frequenting Capricco's for many years and have been pleased with their consistantly good food and service. We went to celebrate a birthday and was a little disappointed. One of the dishes , prepared tableside, was not up to par as Gino was preparing two dishes at the same time and the patron at the other table had specific dietary requests that required Gino to alter his cooking method. Rather than prepare the dish twice, he just threw in the last ingredient at the end. Not professional. Last, I had called ahead asking for a birthday cake and candle. Nothing came. Glad there are other choices for fine dining in Providence... it's time to give Capricco's a rest.
November 5, 2014|Great Menu|5|Menu offers many different and classic selections. Just don't go into the city enough.
November 4, 2014|Me and my fiance went here for our ten y...|5|Me and my fiance went here for our ten year anniversary. It was outstanding! The entire night we didnt have to open a door, pull out a chair, pour a drink. The service was great! The filet mignon was the best we have ever had! The waiter was very knowelgable and nice! Everyone that works there was ery nice from our waiter to the coat check woman to the valet men. We will definately be going back!
November 1, 2014|The food was delicious. Service a bit sl...|3|The food was delicious. Service a bit slow, although they were slammed. My boyfriend ordered the lobster. It came stuffed with scallops and shrimp and very little lobster meat, and was charged $60. We felt that was a bit overpriced.
November 1, 2014|Fantastic|5|"As it should be, Capriccio delivers! What a fantastic dinner. It's the good old school restaurant that does not skip a beat. Servers are top notch, food was fresh and delicious, table side flambé always a crown pleaser and delicious. It definitely exceeded my expectations, I expected it might be outdated with the classic menu etc. but, no way, they really still have it! Place was hopping too, so, they are definitely doing something right. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. It is not just ""dinner"" it is a dining experience, super one at that."

October 25, 2014|Off Night|2|Did not have a great dining experience at this restaurant. Three of us agreed that we would not be returning.
October 25, 2014|Special dining|5|Loved this restaurant. It was not our first time, but it has been consistently excellent.
October 25, 2014|Birthday celebration|3|Proximity of tables hindered our romantic 50th birthday celebration - being seated on top of a large party and having to listen to their conversations all evening. The food was standard: good, but not exactly memorable. Wine list is extensive but heavily weighted on high price selections (wished there had been more affordable, delicious options). Loved the atmosphere of the waiters in tuxes. The one shining moment of the evening was having a flambe dessert of cherries jubilee prepared tableside by ENZO - who was fabulous!
October 24, 2014|Best Veal|5|Excellent meal. My wife and I had veal dishes. The veal is the best I ever tasted. The service was top notch. Great Italian bread!! Best restaurant in Providence

Always a fantastic experience wether it's a intimate dinner for two or if we go for a Easter dinner of five. The food is always rich and fresh, service is nothing short of top notch and the ambient atmosphere is extremely comfortable in every aspect. Strongly encourage to pay a visit and don't forget to ask Gino about the Steak Dianne!!!
October 22, 2014|Delicious!|5|I have been trying to get to this restaurant for some time now and it was well worth the wait! The restaurant is decorated very beautifully. Especially right now with pumpkins and signs of the fall season. I ordered the Scottish Salmon and it was cooked perfectly. I order Salmon every time I eat out and this dish was one of the best. The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu and extremely pleasant. Can't wait to get there again soon.
October 21, 2014|Nice quiet and romantic restaurant!|5|My wife and I eat here at least once every year and it is one our favorite places to enjoy good food, good wine and of course each other!
October 18, 2014|Always special|5|The food and service are spectacular, a true experience. Furthermore, they are lovely with children so it is a great place for a special celebration. This place can compete with the best of the best
October 17, 2014|Best food we have found in Prov|5|Over the last month or so we have dined at 5 restaurants in the Providence/Federal Hill area. The food and service here was the best we have had.
October 15, 2014|Old School Italian|4|Waiters in Tuxes. Old School Italian dining in a dark, atmospheric basement. It is really cool for fans of GoodFellas.
October 11, 2014|Romantic evening|5|A+ for this restaraunt always a very romantic night out , pleasant staff and elegant atmosphere ....
October 9, 2014|Great food raised the score after a disa...|3|"Great food raised the score after a disappointing impression of a restaurant with an excellent reputation for many years. From the valet who was to engrossed in talking to friends than coming to get the car, to waiters talking to a friend at the bar while waiting for drinks to be made, to a bar tender who had no sign of an engaging personality, to generally unfriendly waiters, the service was a negative ""wow."" I kept thinking of how they needed someone to come in and shake up the status quo. A pity."
October 5, 2014|Excellent Italian|5|We have been here twice for dinner. The food is amazing and the wine selection is good. The waiters always have excellent recommendations, are willing to make alterations for food choices and are very knowledgeable about the wine. We have been recommended two very good bottles, one more expensive than the other, and have never been disappointed. We are looking forward to our next visit!
October 4, 2014|It pains me to write this.|2|Very disappointed . Anniversary dinner-noted the occasion when I made the reservation . seated at a tiny table, in the corner near large table of 8. they were notorious noisy but we felt totally neglected by waitstaff. Have had better waiters at Applebee's . Did not ask how things were, no ground pepper or grated cheese offered, not an iota of charm in his service. I stupidly took his suggestion and ordered the special lamb shank. Hubby got veal parm. My was tasteless . Hubby's fine but small portion. They never acknowledged our anniversary . Paid a huge price for a mediocre meal and indifferent service. Capriccio was so disappointing as it was noted to be romantic venue but will never go back nor recommend it.
October 4, 2014|Romantic Dinning|5|We dinned at Capriccio's for my girlfriend's birthday....the wine, dinner, service was 5 Star Rating. Highly recommend Capriccio's!!!!!
September 27, 2014|Best in Providence!|5|I've been to Capriccio several times. It's always outstanding! There are several good restaurants in Providence but I have to say... Capriccio is the best. From the valets to the servers, decor is comfortable and very nice, dinners are outstanding, great wine list. Mixed drinks are perfect. I save this place for special occasions but I really should go more often. Capriccio is the standard by which the others are judged. No room for improvement. Not cheap but a good value for the money. If you want to impress... this is the place to go.
September 27, 2014|Out of the 50's|3|Over the top in price and ambiance. Food was extremely good and well prepared. Service was exceptional.
September 19, 2014|Overpriced and underperforming|3|"We're were there nearly an hour before the salad course was delivered, and waited a long time before that before our drink order was taken. The food was ""good,"" but not up to the price."
September 19, 2014|Awesome in every way|5|Perfect place for a date.ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
September 19, 2014|Best spur of the moment dining..|5|My wife and I hadn't counted on going out for dinner that evening, but on a whim we decide to try Capriccio's. It was better than expected. Food was delicious and the wait staff couldn't have been better.
September 18, 2014|Good food great ambiance|4|The food is always good and the atmosphere is classy. This is the perfect restaurant for a romantic dinner or business dinner when you are looking to impress. The wait staff is professional and prompt.
September 13, 2014|Incredible restaurant|5|If you're looking for a restaurant with an old world charm, excellent food and great service, this is the place. We eat here a couple times of year and it's consistently great.
September 13, 2014|Birthday Best!|5|Capriccio took careof all our needs with fantastic service and good. Special attention given to the food allergy in our party(gluten, dairy an shellfish). Great evening!
September 10, 2014|What a disappointment|1|Our waiter rushed though the specials barely returned to the table to ask if we were enjoying our meal and forget about refilling our glasses with our $100+ bottle of wine. The only enjoyable part of the evening was the food. It was delicious but in no way made up for the atmosphere our waiter created. Our waiter was condescending, abrupt and his behavior was completely unacceptable. Maybe our waiter thought that since we were two women dining together he didn’t have to put in any effort. Clearly we know he could since we both witnessed him showering the nearby tables with attention.
September 9, 2014|The service was out of this world.  The ...|5|The service was out of this world. The food was to die for. We highly recommend to everyone! !!! We will be back!
September 6, 2014|A Special Night|4|Capriccios is where I proposed to my wife 22 years ago and after 22 years of marriage, we still enjoy coming here to celebrate.
August 30, 2014|Great food and service after all these y...|5|Great food and service after all these years! We sat in private room #2 and were nicely attended to while served a delicious meal.
August 29, 2014|We went to Capriccio with 2 other couple...|5|We went to Capriccio with 2 other couples after reading some reviews. Most reviews loved the food but not the service. Well, we could not have asked for better service! Don, our waiter, was knowledgable and witty! We were not rushed and enjoyed every bite. Loved the decor! We will definitely go back!
August 29, 2014|Capriccio's is a great restaurant!|5|And has been for years. Food is outstanding. Ambiance, romantic, great wine list, delicious food & the best service. Rob, our waiter was outstanding. This is the place to go when dining in Providence.
August 23, 2014|*****|5|Capriccio's is by far the best fine dining restaurant in Providence. The menu is authentic and diverse with exceptional accouterments . The Flambe is classic and unrivaled. We bring out of town guests here and they instantly know why Providence is a little known gem for culture and style. The staff is truly professional, service is 2nd to none and the Captain Steve is one of a kind and remarkable.
August 23, 2014|Outstanding food!|5|This was our first time dining at Capriccio's and I have to say the food was absolutely amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly and the options for all courses were great. Our server (Nick) was very accommodating and made sure that our dining experience was perfect. The only downfall was that there was not enough room on our table for the food. Also, the noise level was a bit ridiculous and I think the large group of people at the table near us was served a bit too much to drink, however I know this is not the fault of the restaurant. We will definitely be back again for a special occasion.
August 16, 2014|Awesome food, great vibe|5|Roll yourself back to a top-tier Mad-man style restaurant and you have Capriccio. The food is awesome, the service attentive, and the general vibe reminds you of what it means to have a fine meal... I have used Capriccio for important business meetings, family gatherings, and special occasions and it has never left me with a moment's regret. Perhaps the best testament to how fine an establishment Capriccio is is that my repeat business guests request it by name...
August 12, 2014|Superb dining experience|5|Our first dining experience at Capriccio's was fabulous. The food was rich and delicious. The waiter was the best. Highly recommend for fine dining.
August 9, 2014|Great food/wine, not waiter|4|First time at Capriccio's (I live in California); we went to WaterFire afterwards. Great location--just walk across the street to see it! Wonderful food and wine, service OK, but our waiter had us wondering. He said he had worked there for 38 years, but he didn't give us his full attention when taking our order and answering questions. He was looking around at the other waiters and tables a lot. It was very hard to get his attention when we needed something else, like more butter, etc. But overall we enjoyed everything immensely and I would go back! Valet parking was a plus, especially since the WaterFire events increase traffic dramatically and makes parking elsewhere difficult. Go early (5:30 PM) and then you will not be rushed.
August 2, 2014|Simply the Best|5|I have been eating at Capriccio's Restaurant for 35+ years - one of my favorite restaurants. We ate at Capriccio's last month during Providence Restaurant Week and were very happy to learn that they were still offering that 3 course menu for $35 - what a great deal!I had Carpaccio with truffle oil - American Kobe beef sliced paper-thin, fresh and delicious. For my entree, I had scallops - sweet and cooked perfectly with a polenta cake that was crisp on the outside and soft inside. My friend had perfect veal parmigiana - pounded thin, but still moist and tender veal. He had Tiramisu and I had Panna cotta for dessert - both sweet, creamy and delicious. The waitstaff anticipates your needs - always available without hovering. Love this place!
August 2, 2014|SUPERB!|5|We had dinner for our 45th anniversary the other night and it was superb, as always. This is such a great restaurant, the quality of the food and service are second to none. The attention to detail is wonderful, the food preparation table side is pure entertainment.
August 1, 2014|Capriccio Does Not Disappoint|4|My husband and I dined here on Friday night - restaurant week menu was available although we opted to order from regular menu. We ordered different things- both entrees were very good. Our server, Jane, was excellent - attentive but not hovering. At night's end, we asked that the Maitre'd call us a cab - he offered to have the restaurant's limo driver take us back to our hotel - very nice gesture. When intown again, we would definitely plan to eat here again.
July 31, 2014|Great food|4|I ordered the seafood cake as an appetizer, a 1.25 lb lobster with linguini and the tiramisu. Everything was very good. The linguini was a bit overcooked, but overall, the meal was very good. My BF got the veal parmigiana and it was one of the best I have had in a long while. The breading was made with good quality bread crumbs, cheese, spices and other complex flavors that made every crispy bite, just delicious. The gnocchi that came with the veal was delightful. A nice dining experience.
July 27, 2014|Not recommended|2|Disappointed by the level of service from this restaurant, a recommended dish from the wait staff was misleading and the dish was returned, only to have the Manager be confrontational and asking why it was returned instead of offering a solution.
July 22, 2014|Was disappointed.  Brought a friend to c...|3|Was disappointed. Brought a friend to celebrate a milestone. Service was exceptionally slow, open packet of breadsticks was in our basket. Built up the bar selection and then didn't have what was asked for. But it was the slow service and lack of attention that was disappointing. The maitre'd did send an after dinner drink over in honor of the occasion. That was a nice touch, thank you.
July 21, 2014|peter|5|An amazing restaurant. In my top 10 worldwide. Incredible menu with extraordinary service.
July 19, 2014|Restaurant Week|5|We chose selections from the restaurant week menu and everything was excellent! Great value. We have been here a couple of times and the food and service is always good. Compared to other places we have tried the selection for restaurant week is much better.
July 19, 2014|My Favorite|5|This is my favorite restaurant in RI. I come here every year for my birthday. The waiters are so friendly and attentive. The drinks and food are both phenomenal.
July 19, 2014|Fantastic|5|We dined during restaurant week with another couple. I have a food allergy which was addressed by an outstanding waiter. (sorry did not get his name) He told me not to worry; he would take care of everything. He did! I had the seafood cakes; salmon with risotto, all made special for me! I could tell from others at the table who had the dishes prepared as described on the menu. The 3 choices for dessert all contained my allergic ingredient so the waiter prepared a multi color sorbet, which I enjoyed immensely. My husband had the veal parmigiana; best he's ever had!!! Eveyone enjoyed their meals; good selection to choose from and portions were quite ample. We are definitely going back for another wonderful experience.
Dined on July 18, 2014|Just OK|3|First the good things about this restaurant: the ambience is very good, and the waiters are very professional and polite. The wine list is impressive. The food, however, is simply mediocre. The pork loin I ordered was very oily and bland. The portion was huge, which might count as a plus for some but not for me. I ordered riso as appetizer which was pretty good, though.
July 17, 2014|Classic|4|Classic food in a nice setting, a bit dark inside, but adds to the ambiance
July 14, 2014|A Restaurant Week Gem|5|Who could resist a 3 course dinner at Capricio's for $34.95. The menu had good selection and the service was gracious. The caesar salad was the best I've had in a long time. Our entrees were ample and the Panna Cotta a treat. With the selection available I will definitely be back.
July 13, 2014|Known institution around Rhode Island. U...|3|Known institution around Rhode Island. Unfortunately the food left much to be desired, it certainly wasn't bad food but not memorable either. Could have had the same thing somewhere else and it probably would have been better. The menu has been the same since it opened.
July 13, 2014|Great food, service and ambience.|5|Had dinner with my husband while visiting Providence. Every course was delicious and the service was very attentive. Loved the romantic hideaway ambiance. Would definitely recommend.
July 12, 2014|its so RI|4|food is great. definitely a place to show off your money and rhode islanders are big on showing off.
July 12, 2014|A jewel in Providence|4|I have been frequenting Capriccio's for over 25years. I have brought many, many business clients there over the years and never been disappointed. Most clients ask to go back when they return to Providence. The quality of food is superb and is always consistent. The service, ambiance and Italian dishes are always great. In fact Gino (the Dover Sole expert) has been working there for 38 years. Some of the meals are actually prepared table side. Located in the heart of the city and it is always a destination. Good wine selection. Go there with confidence that the experience will be memorable.
July 11, 2014|first time and loved it|5|Having lived in RI for many years this was the first time I've eaten at Capriccio. It was a celebration for having closed on a house and gotten a new job. In years past I heard it was very expensive. I was surprised to find the pricing reasonable for the quality of food and service. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable. The food was excellent. I had a Haddock special that was cooked perfectly. My wife had the veal and the artichoke and Mozzarella it was prepared with was a beautiful combination. The building itself was lovely and had the touch of history of the stone walls with a mixture of newer architecture that complimented each other and felt quite comfortable. Wholeheartedly loved the experience.
July 10, 2014|Always delicious|4|We have eaten here during restaurant week and just on special occasions. The food is always delicious and the service is fantastic.
July 9, 2014|Loved this restaurant!|5|I went here during restaurant week with two friends, and will most definitely be coming back again, restaurant week or not! The setting is great, classy and elegant. The staff was very attentive and friendly and made us feel welcomed. The food was amazing, perfectly cooked, I had lobster and linguini in a red sauce and it was phenomenal. I'm usually not a fan of red sauces but this sauce had a lot of flavor, and the lobster was great! The next time I come back I will most definitely be getting the filet mignon, as my friend got this and it just melted in your mouth, no need for a steak knife! I can't wait to go back to this restaurant!
July 3, 2014|Classic Dining in Providence|4|Walking down into this restaurant is like stepping back about 30 years. The menu is classic, the service very formal and the ambiance was just ok. Perhaps it would seem cozy in the winter, but a cellar restaurant in the summer just feels dark. We had the scallop appetizer and raw bar for our appetizers which were good and then scallops and the beef risotto for our entrees which were, again, good, nothing amazing. My husband's favorite item was the cannoli. In a town full of excellent restaurants, there are better choices for the same price point as this one.
July 3, 2014|Everything top notch|5|Amazing caprese, the veal dishes are outstanding. Perfect service and terrific atmosphere. Capriccio is the tops, baby!
July 2, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|Great food, great service, and wonderful ambiance.
July 1, 2014|Just okay|3|I was disappointed in the food both the taste and the presentation. It was just ordinary. The waiter was very hard to understand. He had a very heavy accent. I always looked forward to a meal at Capriccio. They must improve their cuisine because there is so much competition out there.
June 28, 2014|A memorable experience!|5|We took friends from Greece and NYC to Capriccio for a typically New England dinner. The appetizers were interesting and delicious. Our guests both had whole lobsters and we had the duck and the tuna. Everything was prepared perfectly and the presentation was excellent. The cannoli for dessert had delectable filling and no sogginess. I highly recommend Capriccio, especially if you are looking for a broad seafood selection.
June 28, 2014|Superb meal, superb dining room|5|"We tried Capriccio because the menu looked outstanding and the restaurant is perfectly situated to walk out the door after dinner and right into the Waterfire display. The Beef Wellington, a classic on the menu, was off the charts, with a really superb mushroom and reduction sauce spooned over it after it is cut (the waiter called it the ""sauce of the gods""...seems about right). This Beef Wellington is done the right way, in an individual pastry as opposed to cut from a larger piece, which they present as a whole, then they slice it and spoon on the sauce. My companion had a duck special that was also exceptional. The wine list is skewed to the expensive side, with the bulk of bottles in the $200-350 range, but nice wines."
June 21, 2014|Delicious food,fantastic service|5|Can't remember server's name, young,slim man, wonderful server, very attentive,nice addition to experience.
June 20, 2014|Don't bother for lunch|1|"Awful waiter. Way too formal, down to the studded cufflinks. Never offered us a fixed price for lunch, never offered us a lunch menu. When we asked if they had a wine list (since none was on the table or give to us), he simply said ""yes."" Finally, after back-and-forth, he asked if we would like to see the wine list. Uh yes idiot! Completely overpriced lunch. Only our table and one other occupied. Now I see why. It seemed like we were bothering him when we needed something."
June 19, 2014|Fancy living|5|Great place, food was excellent. Alcohol was very expensive.
June 14, 2014|Maitre'D|3|Food was good, service was good, but the maitre'd must be a relative of the owner because he was rude and unprofessional. No business would deliberately hire someone with his demeanor.
June 14, 2014|Outstanding!|5|One of the best restaurants in Providence. Outstanding decor, drinks, dinners, service, even the valets are nice. No room for improvement.
June 8, 2014|Celebration|4|We went to Capriccio for a celebration. The food was excellent, nice selections on the menu. We would definitely return.
June 7, 2014|Always 1st Class|5|Cappriccio never disappoints. We have been here at least 50 times and it is the class of Providence for fine dining,
June 7, 2014|Superior service and excellent food|5|My boyfriend and I were treated to dinner Saturday evening with two other couples. The food was outstanding as was the service. Truly exceptional all around. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Capriccio's, a Rhode Island institution for more than 30 years.
June 7, 2014|SureThing|5|We had not been to Capriccios for years but wanted to dine before the theater and naturally thought of this wonderful restaurant. It was just as great as it had been years ago.
June 7, 2014|Wonderful meal and experience!!  Fabulou...|5|Wonderful meal and experience!! Fabulous wait staff and delicious food.
June 2, 2014|We had a wonderful dining experience her...|5|We had a wonderful dining experience here. We had eaten here in January during Providence Restaurant Week and decided to come for my husband's birthday. The only reason for 4 stars was that the potatoes that came with the veal and truffles were so salty that they were almost inedible. Everything else was excellent. My husband loved the veal oscar! This is a great place for a special occasion.
June 2, 2014| A very special night|5|A terrific night for us. It was a Monday night, so we needed a restaurant that was open. The minute we walked in we were met by Sal,the manager, who helped select the perfect table. Eric our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable and made the evening the special night it turned into for us. We had an incredible meal. The wine selection is unbelievable, and we had not one but two bottles of Montrachet (one we took home to the terrace at our hotel). The sommelier was as wonderful and helpful as the other members of the staff. The chef cam from the kitchen to talk speak to us personally. This was a very special evening in every sense of the word. We will return again and again!
May 31, 2014|Perfect for our celebration|5|We were looking for an extra special restaurant to celebrate our daughter's graduation. With so many fabulous Italian restaurants in Providence, Capriccio stands out - we couldn't have chosen a better spot. All was great - from ambiance, to food, to wine, to service. The specials that we tried were particularly creative and tasty. Glad our cab driver recommended it!
May 31, 2014|One of the best meals I have ever eaten!...|5|One of the best meals I have ever eaten! Porcini mushroom appetizer special was out of this world as was my salad with a fried cheese similar to feta. The sole with scallops and shrimp and lobster mashed potatoes was also incredible. The service was great- very attentive without overdoing it. Thank you for a great meal!
May 31, 2014|I was so impressed!!!|5|My first time here and definitely not my last. The service was amazing. We ordered appetizers (poricini mushroom crostini). I love veal and the selection of dishes intrigued me. I ordered the veal with truffles. Hugh portions on this dish. My boyfriend ordered lobster with a meat sauce. He finished his whole order and then started eatting my food.
May 25, 2014|A great experience|4|My wife and I visited Capriccio this past weekend and I have to say the experience was outstanding. The food was excellent - I ordered a tortellini dish and my wife ordered the fettuccine alfredo. My dish was one of the best tortellini dishes I've had, and my wife's dish was just good but not great. They prepared the alfredo sauce table side which was a nice experience. While the alfredo sauce was delicious the chicken they topped the dish with was lacking, it lacked flavor which brought down the overall quality of the dish. With that notwithstanding the overall experience was amazing and I would recommend visiting Capriccio, it was a great experience!

May 23, 2014|Dinner for Graduation from JWU|5|We had an delightful experience at Capriccio's for dinner for our daughter's graduation from JWU. Our waiter, Eric, was also oustanding. His knowledge of the menu and the specials for the evening were top notch. I look forward to dining at Capriccio's again.
May 20, 2014|Always excellent|4|Capriccio's food and service is consistently excellent. Traditional Italian, Classic not swanky. Have always enjoyed dining here.
May 18, 2014|Surpassed High Expectations|5|Special guests visiting Providence from Georgia, desired dining at a great Italian restaurant. They and I were not disappointed!! Highly recommend this wonderful establishment, that provided great food, service and a wonderful ambience.
May 18, 2014|Great Experience|5|The food and service were exceptional. I highly recommend this restaurant
May 16, 2014|Wonderful|5|This was a wonderful lunch service was top notch,food presentation was excellent, atmosphere excellent. You felt like u were in a private dining room. Waiter very attentive. Valet parking. Would highly recommend.
May 15, 2014|A Rare Gem|5|The menu is varied with wonderful favorites that we all know and love, like Veal Pam, as well as rabbit and other specialities. The wine list is extensive, with wonderful not so popular wines like Fiano di Avellino and many other not well known but favorites that true wine lovers seek out! The waiters are seasoned professionals, who still serve you in tuxedos! What a wonderful touch in today's world. It makes the average person feel special. I have a gluten/ dairy allergy. They were very a accommodating! I highly recommend the Tuscan Kale salad! Fantastically delicious. I highly recommend the prefixed menu if you are attending the theatre. It's a short walk to PPAC. A wonderful gem that everyone should experience! Fantastic!
May 11, 2014|Worth going to|4|This is a very nice place and worth going to for special occasions. They did a great pre-fix menu for Mother's Day that I assume they probably do for other holidays. The service was outstanding and we never felt rushed.
Dined on May 11, 2014|graduation dinner!|3|"We had made a reservation for our son's graduation dinner. we gave him the option of choosing restaurants and he chose Capriccio as he wanted the ""kobe beef"" appetizer! The food was very good. The service was not. we had a party of seven people and the waiter was quite rude. Did not even greet us, just came to ask if we wanted drinks and then took our appetizer order. He expected us to order our entree right then and was rather gruff. we told him we were not ready."
May 11, 2014|What a treat!|5|Capriccios is everything a fine dining establishment should be , and more. From the wine list to the menu to the service and ambiance, it is a true five star experience.
May 10, 2014|Wonderful pre theater dinner!|5|We dined here prior to an evening at PPAC, The pretheater dinner was outstanding. Every item our party of 5 ordered was met with rave reviews. The choices on the prefixe were varied and the quality was up to Capriccio's reputation. What a wonderful night !
May 9, 2014|Ask For Bobby|5|Food and service are excellent. Whenever we visit Providence we always go there. Ask for Bobby when you visit.

May 4, 2014|Special, but worth it.|5|We save Capriccio's for special occasions and it never misses. Expensive, but worth it. Don't worry about lack of handicap access. My wife gets carried up to street level in a dining room chair. Always a lot of fun after a great evening.
May 4, 2014|Capriccio|4|A favorite downtown spot for many years. Their pre-theatre dinner is a great deal. Service is always attentive. Valet parking and limo service is a plus.
May 3, 2014|Great Dinner!|5|We were celebrating a birthday for my 17 year old and had a large party of 7. The waiter was very attentive to our party and brought my son a cake that was cut for all members of our party. Oh yeah, and the food was outstanding!
May 3, 2014|WHoa, very impressed|5|I was so dubious when we walked through the door and down the stairs to what looked like a serious throw back/leftover time warp. And in some sense, it was just that. And that turned out to be just fine! As a frequent traveler to Italy, it is VERY rare that I would ever comment let alone rave about an American Italian restaurant. And this place seemed like the least likeliest to find me doing just that. The flavors in the pastas were so vibrant and the apps were mouthwatering and impressive. Service was a little bit shoddy, but it was a Saturday night and they were packed. At least they were respectful. All in all, next time in Providence I am 100% going back. Hope to have the same experience.
May 3, 2014|Always great service and great food.   S...|4|Always great service and great food. So many good things on the menu, that we always struggle to decide on what to have.
May 2, 2014|I enjoy the atmosphere of the old world ...|4|I enjoy the atmosphere of the old world Italian Grotto. The food is outstanding. The wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. I have never had a bad experience and recommend this restaurant to anyone I know who is looking for a good place to dine in Providence.

April 26, 2014|Excellent savory food!|4|We had an exquisite meal at Capriccios! The special appetizer was out of this world; fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, roasted beets and pear, pistachios and best of all drizzle of olive oil. The combination of all ingredients left us begging for more! Our main course was just as good! Finally, a warm bread pudding with marscapone and vanilla ice cream for me and crepes with wild berries table side for my husband. A fine dining experience.
April 22, 2014|The Grotto|5|Capriccio's is located downstairs in a romantic grotto-like setting complete with soft lighting, aged brick walls, and beautifully polished stone floors reminiscent of a Roman estate. The tuxedo clad staff is polite, unobtrusive, and ready to answer questions about the menu, wine list, and evening specials. Excellent food prepared and served with care and timeliness without rushing or otherwise intruding. upon table conversation.
April 22, 2014|Excellent!|5|The service is impeccable. The food was delicious. I had Fettuccini Alfredo cooked table side. It was our anniversary and they surprised us with a little cake and it was delicious. Everything we asked for we got. We drove an hour and would return in a heartbeat.
April 20, 2014|Nice for families/special occasion|4|We had Easter lunch/dinner with a party of 6. The atmosphere was warm….you don't notice its in a basement, feels more like a restaurant in Tuscany :) The food was very good, but in my opinion did not warrant the prices. It was very good, not excellent. The waiter was confident and attentive. His recommendations were on spot. All in all, we would go again.
April 17, 2014|A GREAT Place!!!|5|Capriccio's was absolutley wonderful!!! OUTSTANDING is the correct word for night OUT. We will be back again!!
April 16, 2014|EXCELLENT|5|Capriccios is the Grande Dame of Providence with food and service that are unequaled in New England. If you want a New York dining experience come to Capriccios for the best Dover sole and Steak Diane. Get Geno as your waiter!!
April 16, 2014|Classic cuisine|4|I ate here with my son while we were doing college tours. The restaurant itself is a bit dark and doesn't have the greatest ambience. We had excellent service. The menu is pretty classic. I had oysters rockefeller and veal oscar. Both dishes were done well, but not spectacularly. My son had oysters on the half shell and duck grand marnier. The duck was cooked nicely. If you're looking for good Italian food with great service, come here, but if you are looking for more avant garde or creative cuisine, then you might want to go elsewhere.
April 15, 2014|as usual, the food and service was great...|5|as usual, the food and service was great- the tuna was a real treat and your new chief has a real flare for style- we will be back again and again-thanks so much for a great dining experience
April 12, 2014|Excellent|5|We'd especially like to recognize Ion (Eon?) for the excellent service. Such a personable, professional waiter. I think he has a bright future with whatever goals he has
April 11, 2014|Still a winner!|5|After 37 years, still fresh, classy and delicious.
April 10, 2014|Delicioso|5|Dinner was fantastic. Great appetizer specials and spectacular duck ragout over slightly over cooked pappardelle. As always the service was top notch.
April 4, 2014|A landmark remains superb.|4|Excellent traditional style food with great service. The buratta special appetizer was excellent as was the tuna entree special. The marinara on my linguini side was delicious. The waiter was exceptionally good, splitting and serving our appetizers on individual plates amongst the six in our party. I would highly recommend this superb restaurant which has remained a landmark for decades here in Providence.
April 2, 2014|This was our second visit|5|This was our second visit and we were once again delighted with the food, service and cozy atmosphere. A very elegant place to dine out and enjoy a relaxing evening with exquisite food and service. We look forward to coming back again, next time we are in the area.
March 22, 2014|Almost excellent|3|Birthday dinner seated right at the reservation time. Appreciated the complementary valet parking. Nice lively crowd. Great dinner menu and wine list, although hard to order cocktails. Table service needs some attention. Seemed rushed and impatient. Food was great.
March 21, 2014|great place for a special night out|5|I always enjoy capriccio's I have had times that the food wasn't up to par however every time I have gone and ordered one of the specials it has been top notch. The service is what you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber. This is generally not a place to grab dinner and run, they make dinner a event.
March 21, 2014|Great to go Back|5|It has been nearly 20 years since I last dined here and I'm sorry I waited so long (but I can blame Providence for its abundance of fine dining establishments!) The food was incredible....notably a sushi grade tuna I had as an appetizer and the Scottish salmon was superb. Next time I'll leave room for desert.
March 7, 2014|Great food - excellent service|4|The dishes were wonderful here and the service very attentive. Atmosphere was wonderful for dinner.
March 4, 2014|My fiance and I dined at cappricios|4|My fiance and I dined at cappricios for the first time for his birthday. We had the lobster bisque which was yummy and a large portion, fried calamari which was a little tough, and Cesar salad which was amazing. Our server was really nice and knowledgeable about the menu and other restaurants in the area. He was attentive but not overwhelming. Our main courses were delicious. My fiance had a sirloin cooked to perfection and I had risotto with marsala beef chunks. When we arrived we were sat promptly, but they never asks if we had reservations which I thought was strange. Overall a very nice experience and I would return
March 1, 2014|Everyone seemed to have an|2|Everyone seemed to have an attitude starting with the valet.Bartender was rude and the waitress was like a stone.I have been to the restaurant before and always left satisfied and pleased.
March 1, 2014|The food and service were|4|The food and service were terrific.....highly recommended!
March 1, 2014|Outstanding, but..|5|As impressive as the table side service and presentation may be, the food was cold when placed on the table. We ordered the rack of lamb and after a very hurried presentation by an elderly gentleman (who I understand is iconic to the restaurant), the meal was plated. To say the meat was tepid would be an overstatement. Why bother with the glitz and glamor if the end result is mediocre? The leftovers reheated at home were much more enjoyable.
February 23, 2014|Mmmm!|4|Great food, decent portions depending on what you get. Not overly expensive compared to some others in providence, but sure tastes like the cream of the crop. Can't go wrong with Capriccios.
February 23, 2014|Great Experience|4|The food was excellent and the wait staff was superb!

February 22, 2014|Dress Code what dress code|4|I am a tee shirt and jeans kind of guy, every day. But, this was supposed to be different kind of dinner (and restaurant), nice upscale romantic night out for the wife's birthday. I was very well dressed as I thought i should be for the type of place we were at but after looking around here i am uncomfortable in my attire (suit was a little tight) and I look around and people are dress like they are at the gym, or fast food restaurant. I think they have been letting to many people in that don't belong, Loud, obnoxious, and rude people were the main stay of the customers $260.00 for dinner I don't want to see people in jeans or gym clothes type apparel.
February 22, 2014|Capriccio!|5|What a great restaurant. The service is OUTSTANDING. Although a bit pricey, you get what you pay for, and I definitely don't feel cheated. Only restaurant I know of that has caviar AND Beef Wellington on the menu, and they were both great!
February 21, 2014|All around amazing meal, a must go!|5|Loved everything about it! From the special pre-theatre pricing, to the ambiance, to the colorful wait staff....and who could ignore the food. Some of the best tasting food I've had in years. Reminded me of a scene out of Goodfellas or the Godfather!
February 21, 2014|Feedback|4|We have gone to cappricios several times and as the food, atmosphere, and service are always exceptional, this is the one time the service was lacking. We will continue to go there to dine however would request a different server.
Dined on February 21, 2014|Questionable consistency|3|My dinner was very good however my wife's grouper came uncooked in in the middle. They were very attentive to correcting the situation. They actually remade the dish and it came back nicely cooked and very tasty.
February 1, 2014|Extremely Disappointing|2|It was my wife's forty second birthday and I had made a special dessert request via online reservations. The request was not carried out. Additionally while waiting for our table, my wife and i had a drink at the bar. The staff was overwhelmed and understaffed. The bartender was serving drinks and entering the kitchen while serving food. We were never offered another beverage. Furthermore, our waiter was not a qualified waiter at a high end restaurant. He could not remember our meals and forgot to serve us a glass of wine that was requested 30 min ago. The food was excellent however the restaurant was poorly managed. For the price, your restaurant should always be prepared to deliver the highest level of service. We made a poor investment.
January 27, 2014|Business Luncheon|5|I had a business luncheon at this restaurant which was perfect. The service was efficient, the food was superb, and the noise level low. I would definately recommend for a nice, professional setting to do business.
January 25, 2014|Amazing service, food and ambiance|5|Love it here ! This was our first visit and the gnocchi was amazing. They also had a pear appetizer that was out of this world! Very impressive service, ambiance and food! We will definitely be back in the future!
January 24, 2014|Way too long . . .|5|"We hadn't been to Capriccio's for ""years"", but decided to go during Restaurant Week. We all had a WONDERFUL, relaxing time, talking, catching up and enjoy scrumptious food and wine. We will go back again!"
January 18, 2014|Capriccio's has changed|2|Capriccio's used to be my favorite restaurant, however, the last two times we went the service has gone way down hill, the portions are smaller and the prices are as high as ever!!
January 17, 2014|The Italian/Mafioso is Overdone|3|Been there four times but won't go back. Staff and waiters make you feel as though you're an imposition. I like to feel welcome where I dine. The coat check lady doesn't speak beachside she's on the phone and the maître de looks at you like you have the wrong restaurant. Too many great restaurants in Providence to have to deal with rudeness.
January 17, 2014|You Can't go wrong|5|A tied and true classic Italian Restaraunt in downtown Providence. The atmosphere is all old world charm and classic Italian. The food....well don't even get me started...I wanted everything. Trust me, you just can't go wrong.
January 16, 2014|Our introduction to Capriccio's|5|A wonderful dining experience! Although, we have lived in RI all of our lives, we had never dined here. We came because of Providence Restaurant Week, and we were so glad we did. The carpaccio was outstanding as were our dinner entrees. The service was excellent. It was a memorable evening.
January 15, 2014|Bob S, our server, went through|5|Bob S, our server, went through the special and restaurant week menu with great energy and bravado, it was quite the show. Great service, food came out fast and trouble free. Great atmosphere , other diners were talkative and enjoying themselves. Valet was a plus.
January 13, 2014|Excellent as always!|4|Wide variety for restaurant week menu. Food excellent as always. Service professional without being stuffy. Atmosphere warm and inviting, yet elegant. Definitely recommend!
January 13, 2014|Great Dining|5|The service was attentive, yet allowed privacy. The mussels appetizer in white broth was delicious, & the 2 crostini mopped it all up. The veal was tender & cooked to perfection. The tiramisu was a sweet ending to a wonderful meal.
January 11, 2014|The portion amounts were small|3|The portion amounts were small for the expensive prices on all items on menu
January 11, 2014|Drinks & food were very good|4|Drinks & food were very good - our waiter was not of the caliber for this restaurant somewhat rude at the beginning - towards the end he warmed up but overall not a pleasant experience with our waiter
January 11, 2014|OpenTable Reservation Time Options|5|When I made my reservation on OpenTable for Capriccio's, the only available time slot was 5:00 PM. I made the reservation because it was the only one available. When my husband and I got to the restaurant at 5:00 PM, we were the ONLY patrons in the main dining room areas. I asked our waiter why no one else was there, and he said there were no other reservations until 6:00 PM. We would have much rather made a 5:30 PM or 6:00 PM reservation because 5:00 PM was way too early for us. I'm wondering why 5:00 PM was the only option, when the later options were definitely available. In the future, I will call the restaurant directly to make a reservation rather than use OpenTable.
January 10, 2014|Fab for lunch!|4|Celebrated with a friend for her birthday and was not disappointed! Went for lunch and the valet parking is great to get in and out without worrying about parking in the city. The food was delicious and there was a great selection. The service was very good and we weren't rushed which was a treat in itself. Great place!
January 8, 2014|Never again|1|"My husband and I came to Capriccio for lunch on Wednesday, January 8th. I realize it was Restaurant Week and the waitstaff might be less than thrilled with the reduced prices, but our waiter was the worst we have ever had in any restaurant anywhere. I don't know his name because he never introduced himself, he simply approched the table and said ""Do you guys know what you want"". I don't need to go on and on about how disappointed we were in his rudeness, but I will add that when I went to have my leftovers the next day, had only put half of them in the to go container. I can say with absolute confidence that we will never be back to Capriccio."
January 2, 2014|Overpriced|3|Food was good but expected outstanding for the prices. Was charged 50.00 for a 10.00 bottle of wine and the waiter told me this was a good deal, wine was not on the menu so I didnt know the price till the bill came. I should have asked but instead trusted that the waiter was correct in saying that this particular bottle was a good deal. capriccio's is a Providence landmark that I feel has lost some of the quality that used to be there. It is now over rated and over priced!!
December 28, 2013|fantastic|5|All I can say is the food the service and the atmosphere was awesome I can't wait to go back
December 27, 2013|Not impressed|3|Had chosen Capriccio for a very special dinner for my four grandchildren before their Christmas gift of tickets to Wicked. I had been there several times a few years ago and had enjoyed the food and presentation. Checked with the restaurant about bringing the kids to be sure, they are not little. Service was very good but not special by any means . No conversation engaged at all. Food had no special presentation at all. My daughter chicken was a cutlet with a mushroom placed on top. The kids loved the fettuccine presentation at the table. Highlight of the evening. Food arrived lukewarm. Wait dress never returned for the bill. We just left. Very very disappointed.
December 22, 2013|Great Experience|5|This is one of my family's favorite special occasion restaurants - birthdays, Christmas Eve, Graduations, anniversaries. This is old school fine dining. A wonderful experience. Highly recommend this restaurant.
December 17, 2013|A decent proposal|5|After 46 years my husband reproposed with ring on bended knee . We love this restaurant always ordering chef's specials, and a favorite Gino's scampi flambé. Definitely a destination restaurant as we build a weekend around it. Beautiful ambience, excellent service, and delicious food. Go and enjoy!
December 14, 2013|Very nice ambience|4|Good meal! The food is always good . Menu changes for the holidays with all The Italian specials
December 14, 2013|They've Still Got It!|5|Consistent quality in all aspects of fine dinning over the years.
December 13, 2013|PARTY|4|THe only problem was a table of about 25 people that were very loud. One lady was so loud you hear her in Cranston! It made dinner conversation difficult and hard to hear the waiter. It detracted from the ambience. Other than that it was great.
December 13, 2013|Wonderful as always!|5|this is a yearly tradition for us at the holidays, and as usual we were not disappointed - service is the best around, food was outstanding and the holiday atmosphere tasteful and festive. A delight as always!
December 10, 2013|Perfect Holiday Spot|5|When I asked a friend what restaurant in Providence had the best Christmas decorations, he suggested Capriccio. Not only was it lovely, but the food was fantastic. We had appetizer and main dish specials and they were beautifully prepared and delicious. A perfect holiday spot.
December 6, 2013|Fantastico!|4|Great ambience in a basement setting done with style. The ceilings are low (under 7') giving a warm and comfortable feel to this classic establishment. Great seating in large chairs surrounding intimate table spacing.
December 6, 2013|The lunch special was a surprise,|5|The lunch special was a surprise, the food excellent,our waiter very attentive,but there were small children which took away from the overall upscale feel of the restaurant.
December 5, 2013|Fantastic|5|Everything was fantastic, especially the waiter, Tony, he made the night. We were out for our Christmas get together and everything was wonderful. You can't beat Capriccio's!
December 2, 2013|Best Italian, restaurant in|5|Best Italian, restaurant in New england. Food, Service, setting is wonderful.
November 29, 2013|Elegant|5|For the most memorable evening. Made New Years Eve reservations the night we were there.
November 29, 2013|A fine pre theater meal|5|Our server was outstanding. The food was excellent as well. Not cheap but worth it for a special occasion.
November 29, 2013|Everything was excellent as|5|Everything was excellent as always and the food was cooked to perfection.
November 27, 2013|Exceptional food and service!|5|Went to capriccio to have an excellent dining experience and was not disappointed. From beginning to end I was elated from my seafood salad special, perfectly cooked veal porterhouse special and my table side cherries. Can't wait to return with friends to share the wonderful experience.
November 23, 2013|A very unhappy birthday|1|Went to Capriccios for my wife's birthday dinner, and could not have been more disappointed. The night started on the wrong foot at the bar, where the bartender was rude and appeared to be overwhelmed. The waiter was nice enough, when he did come by, but reeked of a combination of cigarette smoke and Axe body spray. The time he spent smoking may have been better served waiting on the table, as we sat with empty drinks far too long. The true disappointment was my wife's beef wellington, which was severely overcooked on the first attempt (medium rare usually has some pink in my experience), and the second attempt was equally as bad. Although the waiter was nice enough to take it off the menu, the manager never bothered to stop by the table.
November 20, 2013|2nd class|2|"We requested and were seated at a fireplace table. We were asked to move after we were seated because us sitting there was a ""mistake""... Apparently someone more important came in. Management was so rude. I have never been treated like that at any place or occasion in my life.(We refused to move) Table service was more than excellent and food was good."
November 17, 2013|Best Restaurant in New England|5|Classic French and Italian food cooked to your requested exactly. Anyone that doesn't enjoy this experience has no sense of amazing food or wonderful service. I have been here at least 10 times over the last 2 years and have NEVER received anything but a comfortable quiet table and have never been served anything but the best meals I have ever received,
November 9, 2013|a night of surprises !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|2|While going out to dinner for a celebration, you hope for an enjoyable evening, you try to eliminate the risk by picking a restaurant with a good reputation. Although the environment is dark, and the tables are close enough to hear your neighbors conversations iI still found myself enjoying my evening! :) The food was unique, but in all honesty I would be in no rush to return...
November 9, 2013|Birthday dinner|4|Food and service and ambiance were wonderful. The wait staff was very well versed regarding the menu and specials. We were not rushed and were able to have a very relaxed dinner. Would have given the restaurant five stars but the snide remark from the waiter who brought our wine really upset me. We ordered a bottle of $35.00 wine (most bottles are in the hundreds) and he made a comment about having plenty of that wine. Just really bothered me. Next time we are in Providence we will definitely eat there again, but won't order any wine.
Dined on November 3, 2013|Great dining in Providence|5|"Though I am not a ""regular"" at Capriccio's, I always enjoy dining there. The service is professional and attentive. There is a great array of items on the menu, along with delicious specials. The Shrimp Scampi prepared table-side, is a great dish. There have a good assortment of desserts and after dinner drinks, as well as expresso and capucchino. It's a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion."
November 2, 2013|Quiet and cozy|5|This was our second trip to Capriccio's, and it was great. The food was wonderful, they have a very extensive wine list, all the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and professional.
November 1, 2013|Simply wonderful.|5|Celebrated my son's 21st birthday. Wonderful service, amazing menu and personal service.
October 27, 2013|Top Restaurant!|5|We cannot say enough about our dining experience at Capriccio. It was truly wonderful!
October 26, 2013|Beautiful Restaurant|3|Very romantic atmosphere. The food was excellant as was our Waitress.
October 25, 2013|My family and I have been|4|My family and I have been to Caprccio many times over the past seven years or so and it's always bee wonderful. Again this time the food was exceptional and the chef was gracious enough to prepare a special request for me. The service however for the first time was week. The server didn't seem to understand my request (chef bailed her out) and was very intensive.
October 25, 2013|when contempt permeates|2|"We thought that the Prix Fixe Theater Menu had interesting choices and would be a good value, and many years ago thoroughly enjoyed Capriccio. But from arrival on Friday, we were treated with condescension at every turn. We are a mom and daughter dining alone and the ""just you two?"" was as we came in. Apparently, without men in the party we were not of interest? No specials were read to us, but other tables received them. We were well dressed for the theater so I can't for the life of me understand the treatment. Will never go again."
October 25, 2013|Great restaurant, bad valet|4|"Had a great time, incredible menu, wine list and waitress, as well as nice interior and obviously the food was fantastic. Price wasn't too bad although some wines were VERY marked up. Only complaint is the valet is rude, the valet driver have me a big attitude because I didn't know where to leave my car, then gave me an attitude when I tried to give him my key because I didn't notice he already had keys in his hand. Upon getting back my car, his response to my thank you was a slightly sarcastic ""yup"". For such an upscale place the valet could be better."
October 16, 2013|Slipping. Used to be much|3|Slipping. Used to be much better. Food, service, atmosphere are a little less spectacular than in the past.
October 12, 2013|Excellent|5|Overall the night was excellent. Good food great service and the scene was fun and lively.
October 12, 2013|AMAZING ROMANTIC, COUPLES DREAM NHT|5|Great night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Fabulous food, perfect service, food is a taste bud pleaser. This is my new fine dining restaurant. Dress to impress, price is good especially for the cooking.
October 9, 2013|Wonderful|5|Wonderful menu selection, wonderful quality and taste, wonderful atmosphere (currently harvest ambiance), and wonderful service!
October 8, 2013|Special Birthday Dinner|5|We thoroughly enjoyed a special dinner, all 7 of us including 2 children, with outstanding food and great service. Always a special occasion choice!
October 7, 2013|Always a special experience|5|Capriccios never lets you down. They retain the charm and reliability of one of the superb restaurants in the Northeast. Table side preps are not to be missed. Old world fettuccini Alfredo. The oysters Rockefeller best this side of Delmonicos. On Friday night go into the bar and see some of the characters the Sopranos was modeled on! Service is primo from highly experienced, tuxedo clad waiters.
October 6, 2013|good for special night out|4|food is very good. I received the wrong item but I was ok with what I got. large menu selection. good for special occasions.
October 5, 2013|Great night|5|From the time we were greeted by Sal and Enzo to the time our waiter Anthony finished taking spectacular care of us the whole experience was memorable.Thank you for a nice time .John Vallante
October 5, 2013|A Gem!|5|Great food and atmosphere ... An overall outstanding experience!
October 5, 2013|I think the theatre special|3|I think the theatre special selections are limited - service is good but the atomosphere is rushed.....
October 5, 2013|Outstanding|5|I took my girlfriend here for a datenight (no special occasion). We were the youngest couple in the room but we're treated like every other group! The food was incredible; a short rib served with spinach, carrots, and French fries with a salad. The salad was absolutely amazing and she found her lobster pasta to be wonderful. For desert we ate teramesu which could be compared to eating a cloud! Very fluffy, and sweet but not overwhelming. The environment here is really something, very romantic. By far one of the best resturants I have eaten at and everything came out to be $73 before tip! Outstanding!!
October 4, 2013|best Italian food & service ever!|5|Downtown Providence Service & food spectacular! Although my wife & I were underdressed compared to most of patrons , staff in tuxs made us feel like family, They treated us like the most important customers in the place ! Joe
October 4, 2013|Amazing|5|When deciding upon the finest of Rhode Island's numerous restaurants, Cappricio's stands out among one of the best. The food, atmosphere and impeccable service are amazing. There is no more romantic restaurant in the city. Cappricio's is truly impressive in every way.
October 2, 2013|So glad we rediscovered Capriccio!|4|Hadn't dined there in many years as we rarely go in to Providence but recently we wanted a good restaurant with valet parking handy to Waterfire on one occasion and now PPAC. It was the perfect choice both times. He food, ambiance and service all added greatly to the special nights we had planned. The restaurant is a real classic.
September 28, 2013|Beautiful Italian Food But...|4|"They practially reset the table while we were finishing up our conversation. The food was amazing. We had dinner with a friend that admits he is an ""italian food snob"". He made some special requests and they exceeded his expectations on all levels. He was VERY impressed. But as our meal approached the end, they started clearing the table, and almost started resetting it while were still wrapping up our conversation. I felt this was extremely rude. And I didn't even notice anyone waiting for a table. Also be prepared as I thought the seating was along the waterway but it is the complete opposite. This restaurant is in the basement of a building so it is very dark and sort of claustrophobic. Great food just lacked in service."
September 27, 2013|Great pick!|4|Great place to have a good conversation in a quiet and romantic atmosphere while enjoying great food!
September 26, 2013|Providence|3|I went for a weekend away with my husband and we decided to go to Capricio's. We use to go in college. The waiter was very fair. He hardly looked at us. He was always focused on what he had to do next. We were very disappointed with him.
September 24, 2013|special occasion|5|My wife and I have been here 3 or 4 times for a birhtday dinner for her and it has not failed us yet! The food is fantastic, the wine list has a great selection and the service is awesome! I tell all myfriends and family about this restaurant everytime we go and how they s have should give it a try. Last but not least the ambiance is very romantic!
September 23, 2013|An undiscovered gem|5|After 12 years living in Providence, we decided to try Capricco. What we experienced is a restaurant that reflects the lost art of very refined dining. The space is most elegant yet very comfortable with beautiful furnishings and table settings. Our before dinner Martini's were classic and well chilled and our meal was delicious and beautifully served. To our astonishment, prices for cocktails and dinner was most reasonable, especially considering the classy setting. To top it all off, our server, Matthew, was perhaps the most naturally elegant server I have ever experienced in my 74 years. He had a level of sophistication far beyond his young age and was most instrumental in producing a most memorable evening.
September 23, 2013|Anniversary date|5|Monday is a great night to dine out! No crowds, no wait, attentive servers and quiet surroundings. Food was fantastic and Anthony met all our needs. If you've tried Capricco's you know how good it is and if you haven't, what are you waiting for?
September 21, 2013|Best in Providence|5|Fantastic as usual, after a day of painting the porch, I decided to treat my girl to something special. We don't go but 4-6 times a year however, when we do, its a great time. Put on your fancy dudes and go out and enjoy yourself. Be ready for some special treatment from the moment you drive up to the front door and hand the valet your keys. The food is food is excellent and the service can't be beat. A bit expensive but worth every penny. A classic Providence experience. Wonderful
September 21, 2013|Date night|5|Having wanted to go here for a long time finally made reservations ... Was not a t all let down. We had a excellent time from first entering to leaving was far superior ... The food , wait staff and restraunt staff were excellent ... Will defi agley be back for dining soon... If you love Italian and romance this is your place .....
September 21, 2013|Great Italian, Great Ambiance|5|I took my girlfriend here for a romantic dinner on a friday night. We had a long 3+ hour dinner and the waitstaff was very accommodating. Although both of us were student-age, the restaurant staff treated us like kings and were very kind and amiable. We ordered two appetizers, one soup and one clam dish which were both very good. Just as a warning, most of the appetizers are seafood based, at least at this time of year, which I was not expecting. Nevertheless, the appetizers were very good and the main course was fantastic. The shrimp scampi was prepared at the table and very flavorful. The veal was good, and the portions were large and filling. The food overall is expensive but it is definitely worth the extra bills. Highly recommended.
September 21, 2013|Disappointed|2|Capriccio seems to have lowered the standard for the food and service. We made the mistake of ordering off the prix fixe menu and that was a huge mistake. We've had better food at Applebees. The service also seemed to lack the personal touch of the past.
September 21, 2013|One of the finest!|5|It all begins with the exceptional greeting and the immediate attention paid by the wait staff. The specials are so diverse and plentiful that choosing one means leaving out another great choice. Expertly prepared and incredibly delicious, every bite requires a word describing your enjoyment. What an experience!
September 16, 2013|Great restaurant|5|The food, ambiance and service were first rate. Look forward to being in Providence so I can dine here again.
September 14, 2013|Great place, like always|5|My wife had a Caesar salad and I had scallops and for main she always get the Dover sol and I had the fillet . It was great like always
September 14, 2013|Always Outsatnding|5|Cappriccio's never fails to please no matter the occasion. Food was excellent especially the fresh fig salad.
September 14, 2013|Intimate and full of ambiance.|4|Intimate and full of ambiance. The tables are arranged for privacy with high backed chairs that help the intimate feeling. Food is outstanding and its presentation is always wonderful.
September 13, 2013|Overall Good|4|Food and service very good, Our $275 bottle of wine was less than perfect.
September 12, 2013|Long term GEM|5|Another home run , great food, service and total dining experience
September 7, 2013|Always a Great Experience|5|Anyone who loves a good steak should experience the Tenderloins Diane'.........cooked tableside. I cant resist it.
Dined on September 7, 2013|Great choice in Providence|4|Our foursome enjoyed Capriccio on a recent Waterfire night. We were pleasantly surprised with a 3 course $29.95 menu option. The men loved their veal parm. The appetizers and desserts were great. My lobster cardinale did not live up to its description as a 1 1/4 lb lobster with pasta. The only lobster was a portion of a very small tail-not even 1/4 lb. The pasta was swimming in the excellent sauce. I did not bring this to the attention of the waiter as I was a guest of the other couple and didn't want to complain. This issue wouldn't keep me from highly recommending Capriccios.
September 7, 2013|Disappointing Anniversary Dinner|2|Not sure what has happened but this visit was sorely disappointing. The food was just not up to its prior standards. It started with a beat salad that was so hard you couldn't cut the beats and went downhill from that point.
September 7, 2013|My only complaint was the|5|My only complaint was the waiter never asked if we wanted a second drink. Otherwise it was amazing
September 5, 2013|basement chic|5|didn't know it was in the basement. Dark, no windows but clean and nicely appointed.
September 5, 2013|Exceptional Italian Food|5|One of the best in Rhode Island! Excellent food and wonderful wines.
September 4, 2013|Great dining|5|Capriccio's is a great restaurant whien you're clelbrating a special occasion or simply want to treat yourself to a great Italian dining experience. The wait staff is knowledgeable abd personable. The subdued lighting, roses on the table, and quiet atmosphere are perfect elements for a relaxing evening.
September 1, 2013|Capriccio|5|I ordered he rib eye steak special...The meat was tender but had no flavor.....Very disappointed.
August 24, 2013|New to us, will be back!|5|Overall, an extraordinay experience, every aspect was excellent, our waiter was gracious and knowlegable about every aspect of the food and wines. A memorable experience, looking forward to visiting again
August 24, 2013|Terrific Dinner|4|Our dinner was very good and served at a perfect pace. The waiter, Joe did an excellent job of recommending specials, choices and being just attentive enough to our service. The evening was great from appetizers through dessert!
August 24, 2013|Superb|5|From the efficient, knowledgable and attentive waiter, to the scrumptous food (veal chop and duck), it's now on the fave list.
August 23, 2013|Amazing|5|Amazing food, impeccable service. Best restaurant in Providence!!
August 21, 2013|Capricco|5|This restaurant is definitely one of Providence's gems. It will help you create the perfect evening with your special someone.
August 20, 2013|Wonderful evening!|5|Everything was so good. Made my special night very memorable.
August 18, 2013|Wonderful!!|5|We reserved a table here based on the consistency of the outstanding reviews, and I'm happy to say we were not disappointed. Exceeded our expectations on every level! From the excellent service to the well prepared dishes, and the whole ambiance of the restaurant itself, it was simply a wonderful experience for my husband & I. While driving back to Boston, I added Capriccio to my favorites OpenTable restaurants. We will certainly dine here again the next time we're in Providence. Just a little side note, there is a restaurant in Waltham, MA with a similar name & just as wonderful. We doubt that it's related....or maybe its just in the name....
August 14, 2013|Nothing but the best|5|Nothing but the best here food is a bit pricie but well worth every penny.Any time i go out to a very special occasion there is no where better
August 12, 2013|Consistently Excellent|5|We always enjoy our dinners (and lunches) at Capriccio's. It is our favorite restaurant, and always the one we turn to for our special occasions.
August 7, 2013|I have been to this resturant|5|I have been to this resturant many times, for all sorts of occassions, it is always great and if Geno is there you will feel like you are in the Godfather Movie!
August 3, 2013|Outstanding service|5|We dined with friends and from the moment we arrived until the conclusion of our night, the service was outstanding. We never felt rushed; however, the waitstaff was always attentive to our needs. Food was delicious.
August 1, 2013|Don't miss this one...........|5|Had been meaning to try for awhile and I was not dissapointed. Terrific service, food ambiance and more. You cannot go wrong. Perfect for a special occassion. Just surpassed a few of my favorites on Federal Hill.
July 31, 2013|There is only one Capriccio!|5|We moved from Rhode Island 10 years ago and don't come back too often. This recent trip was for two nights and we made reservations at Caricco's for both nights. I did not want to eat dinner anywhere else. Both dinners were the usual Capricco wonderful! Veal you could cut with a fork, done to perfection. Dover Sole, Steak, everything excellent, both nights
July 28, 2013|Wonderful Restaurant|5|The food was amazing. The service was probably the best I've encountered in a very long time. The waiter went above and beyond in assisting my father and I in choosing our meals and dessert. It was my father's 88th birthday - and afterwards, he told me he enjoyed it more than anything in his recent memory. Thank you all so much!
July 27, 2013|Off the Charts|5|We stop in Providence specifically to go to Capriccio. It never, ever disappoints! First, Dining Captain Gino and his team make one feel warmly welcome. This is a set up for the fabulous food to come. This visit had the July Restaurant Week menu. We decided to try but added on with additional appetizers -one being the dates stuffed with goat cheese! The artichoke appetizer was great too. For entrees:I had the chicken, husband had the veal. Both Wows! We ended with a light fizzle - that being the prosecco float. Thank you, Chef! Thank you, Capriccio!
July 27, 2013|Great for a Special Occassion|5|We had a wonderful time celebrating our anniversary there. Beautiful setting, wonderful food, and great service. They are offering their Restaurant Week menu through Labor Day which is a great menu, and great savings.
July 27, 2013|Always Wonderful|5|Every time we dine here, it is a positive experience. This is our favorite restaurant in Providence because it is gracious, reliable, and fabulous.
July 27, 2013|prix fix|5|The prix fix meals were excellent. A great selection to choice from. The seafood cakes were excellent and I could have made a meal with just that and a salad. The lobster over pasta & pink vodka sauce was out of this world. My husband had the tiramisu and he said it was the best he has ever had.
July 26, 2013|We have liked it in the past|1|We have liked it in the past but this experience was Awful. Sommelier served the bottle of Chardonnay at room temp and was then annoyed when we pointed it out....simply said that they were all like that. We had put it back in the ice bucket and wait at least ten minutes for it to chill to a somewhat reasonable temp. Two of of our party ordered the lobster with pasta which was billed as a 1 and 1/4 pound lobster, but there was only a very tiny bit of tasteless lobster and the pasta was pasty. The initial bill was correct but after he split it in half and presented it for signature.....an additional $100 was added. No real apology.....wow.
July 25, 2013|Fabulous Lunch at Capriccio|5|"Three of us enjoyed a fabulous lunch at Capriccio recently. We had the Prix Fixe luncheon menu which is one of the best bargain's in Providence. Mixed drinks were perfect; I had a very nice, dry chianti that was very reasonably priced. My veal parmesan was a deliciouis piece of veal, perfectly prepared. I could cut it with a fork.The pasta and sauce (or ""gravy"") was also just right. Dessert and capuccino was also exceptionally good: the tiramisu was delicious. Service was a team effort and it was friendly, warm and very efficient. All this for about $16 per meal, plus drinks, tax and tip. We plan to go back frequently. We used the free valet parking which was very convenient."
July 23, 2013|This fine dining location great!|5|We had a newly wed couple as our guests of their wedding gift! Everyone was very impressed with all areas of Capriccio's from service, food choices, decor! From cocktails with Lisa in the lounge to our fine dining with Chris Mancini as our waiter was perfect. Our newly weds had never dined at Capriccio before..............they will be back!!
July 21, 2013|Do they just microwave their food?|1|My eggplant Parmesan was not a bit hot, when it arrived. The waiter took it to heat it up. If t was fresh cooked, how did it get cold so fast? The only good thing is that they have pina coladas.
July 20, 2013|DISAPPOINTMENT & LETDOWN|3|"CAPRICCIO'S HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. PLACE IS ALWAYS BUSY. CALL WELL IN ADVANCE FOR PRIME RESERVATION. MUST BE A GREAT PLACE TO DINE! FOOD MUST BE GREAT! RIGHT. WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE IT WAS RESTAURANT WEEK, OR MAYBE NOT, BUT WE WERE NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH THE ""FOOD"". HOUSE WINE WAS O.K.! WAITER WAS VERY FRIENDLY AND MORE THAN ACCOMMODATING. MAYBE WE'LL TRY AGAIN AND ORDER FROM THE REGULAR MENU!"
July 20, 2013|First time dining here|4|we had a good time overall. It was a little noisier than we expected but it is a beautiful restaurant and the food was very good.
July 18, 2013|A Divine Experience!|5|This must be what heaven is like! Ambiance to die for.
July 13, 2013|Great Food and Great Service!|4|My friends and I were celebrating our birthdays and choose Capriccio because of the Providence Restaurant Week discount. The service was unbelievable! Our waiter was attentive, energetic, engaged, compromising, and a lot of fun. From the host to the bus boy, the service was stellar. Oh and the food was delicious too, the arancini was literally the best I have ever had. Definitely will be returning.
July 13, 2013|Great service|4|We took advantage of restaurant week to try this popular but pricey restaurant. Service was impeccable,no hovering but well timed for our needs. Mussels de Zuppa was excellent ,so were the seafood cakes. The pork loin was borderline dry,but the fruit stuffing and sauce saved the dish.My friend had the veal parmigiana, which was pretty good. This restaurant would be suitable to celebrate a special occasion, as it is a bit expensive.The restaurant week menu was a bargain! However I would not hesitate to return based on quality of food and service.
July 13, 2013|Beautiful Italian restaurant|5|This place was classy and comfortable. The food was delicious and presented well. The service was excellent. I brought my two children here and they felt very comfortable ( ages 12 and 7 ). I would definitely go back again.
July 11, 2013|Loved my meal and the serbice.|5|Loved my meal and the serbice. my meal included the filet mignon that was perfectly, extremely tender & very tasty. My spouse had the seafood cakes for appetizer, & scallop risotto...loved it! The Tuxedos added just the right finesse.
July 11, 2013|Great time had by all!|5|A group of 10 of us had dinner here on July 11th. It was AWESOME! The only down side is that we were NOT promptly greeted by the Maitre D' and other wait staff was not helpful in letting us know that a Maitre D' even existed. So we just stood there waiting wondering if we were even in the right place. The host's stand is hard to identify so we were milling around. This was confusing and not of the level of professionalism we were expecting. Thankfully, after a couple of minutes we were greeted by the host and seated. Phew! They need to work out the kinks on that one. Our meal however was flawless and our waiter was exquisitely attentive. We enjoyed ourselves tremendously.
July 10, 2013|capriccio|5|food excellent-service excellent-restaurant very charming
July 7, 2013|Elegant Dining|4|Not much of a view, since it is located in the lower level of a building, but still feels like it's out of a movie. Food and service were very good.
July 3, 2013|Still worth the wait!|5|"I first dined at Capriccio when I was impressing my high-school girlfriends! It worked to impress then...It works to impress (my Wife) now! This restaurant is located in the lower level of a historic downtown Providence building, just across from the river. Valet is alert and courteous. The matre'd was right on point as is the wait-staff! Although the specials here are the way to go...beef wellington is a great staple (and trumps the White Horse Tavern). As for desert, ""do it!"" The cost is average for this level of product & service. You will be thrilled!"
Dined on July 2, 2013|Capriccio review|5|My husband and I have celebrated special occasions and have hosted friends at Capriccio for over 35 years. This restaurant is consistently good and the service is exemplary!!!
June 29, 2013|Old fashioned classic service|5|Great dinner-accommodated a special meal, attentive server, great for. Not overly pricey either.
June 26, 2013|A Gem In Providence|5|Great Wine, Food and Service. Do I need to say more. We had Bob as our server, he was knowledgeable, entertaining and keep the service rolling. Good place to entertain and have a private meeting and a good time.
June 24, 2013|Luncheon bargain at Capriccio's|5|Three of us enjoyed the three course business lunch special. The food was excellent, the service was terrific and the price could not be beat.
June 22, 2013|Great restaurant!|5|The food was amazing. My favorite plate is the duck pasta and the burrata!! They make your birthday very special and bring a customize birthday cake on the house, if you let them know when you make your reservation.
June 15, 2013|Nice show, good (if not great) food|4|Went for our anniversary. A luxurious dining room that manages to feel dark and intimate while having light at your table that makes it easy to see others and what you are eating. Burrata appetizer was not as good as we have had at 2 other places. My wife enjoyed the fois gras, but not quite up to the $20+ price tag. Her steak Diane prepared at the table is a great show and great food. My beef stroganoff was okay; it seemed that not all the beef chunks were tenderloin, and a bit too saucy and sour for me. I suppose that others may find this the hallmark of stroganoff. They brought a cake to our table for our celebration. Very nice! Easily worth a second visit, if only for the lovely room and the table-side preparation.
June 9, 2013|Pre-show dinner|4|Visited before the show. The food and service was very good. The waiter was quite attentive and made sure we were out in time. It is so nice to see waiters elegantly dressed in tuxes. The Carpaccio was especially good.
June 9, 2013|Great Dining Experience!|5|This was our first visit to Capriccio, but will not be our last. They offer a terrific pre-theatre, three course menu, at a great price. Wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable, extrememly professional, and personable. Nothing but accolades to share about our entire experience.
June 8, 2013|The Best!|5|The best filet mignon I have ever had. You could cut it with a fork. The brandy cream sauce topped it off. What a taste! From start to finish. Our waiter Nick took care of us like the professional he is.we will be looking forward to going back again in the near future. It was a great night out.
June 1, 2013|romantic night out|4|We dined @ cappricio then took a gondola ride on the river. IT was truly a magical night . The ambiance and service @cappricio made for a wonderful evening.
May 28, 2013|Best lunch value in town|5|Capriccio runs a regular $15.99 prix fixe lunch menu, as well as the à la carte menu. There are three courses, soup or appetizer, entrée and dessert. I've had most of the items, and they are large and excellent. It's perfect for business meetings, as long as you have a bit longer than the regular one hour for lunch. The dining room is below ground, atmospheric and beautiful. Highly recommended.
May 26, 2013|Amazing!|5|Excellent dining experience. I recently ate here with my family for my graduation and the experience was nothing short of amazing. The food was spectacular and the service second to none.
May 26, 2013|Dessert|5|Finish off your fine meal with a proseco float. The best! They will split it for you if you want to share.
May 26, 2013|loved it!!|5|I brought my boyfriend there for his birthday and we both loved it. The food was incredible, a very nice atmosphere and the service was great! Highly recommend!
May 26, 2013|Anniversary Celebration|5|Took my wife there to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. Wonderful experience all around

The entire experience was perfect. The food was fabulous. Pasta, fish and filet was cooked to perfection. Cannoli's and spumoni were very good. We will return!
May 22, 2013|Sets the standard|5|One of the best restaurants in Providence. Only disappointment this time was that server did not make any engagement to our special occasion, not even an acknowledgement. Other than that everything was great.
May 18, 2013|Fantastic|5|Have always wanted to try this RI landmark and I am glad I did. The service was incredible! The food fantastic! From the moment you drove up you were greeted warmly, sat quickly and from then on it was truly an experience. The waiters are professional, knowledgable, but not pretentious. The food is amazing well proportioned and plated perfectly. It can be a tad pricy but I challenge anyone to find a restaurant in this area that offers the food and service that Capriccio's offers.
May 15, 2013|Anniversary|4|My wife and I went there for our anniversary and Capriccios served a surprise desert cake - very nicely done, and quite a large cake. Food was very good but not exceptional, we both had the ribeye. I love the ambiance and decor of the restaurant and conversation is very easy to hear. Service was very attentive.
May 15, 2013|Went to Capriccio's with a|5|Went to Capriccio's with a group of 7. The restaurant has a comprehensive menu with Italian specialties. Our waiter, Bob, was a veteran, very knowlegable, and had a great sense of humor. Bob put together crowd pleasing appetizer plates for all at the table. Customized dinner orders were no problem, either. The entire group was pleased. Not one complaint.
May 11, 2013|Great food and service|4|Food and service were very good. Very much a traditional Italian restaurant with a very expansive menu. The Saturday specials list was almost another whole menu. Service was very good - friendly and very professional. Lots of variety on the menu. My son had the Beef Wellington (not your typical Itallian restaurant fare) and it was done perfectly, especially for a notoriously difficult to prepare dish. All our dishes were very good and no long waits for food. Waiters do lots of table side prep for different dishes which makes for a busy environment, but entertaining. Not inexpensive, but I'd consider it a good value, given the quality of the food and experience.
May 4, 2013|Great waiter|4|Anthony was a great waiter! First time that something was not cooked right! But Anthony took care of it right away! First time that it took a while for food to come out! Even though was busy! Besides the oysters Rockefeller not being cooked the first time. Everything else was great!
April 27, 2013|Unbelievable service and food|5|Unbelievable service and food was absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend this to anyone without reservation!
April 19, 2013|The fixed prixe lunch menu|5|The fixed prixe lunch menu @ $15.99 was an incredible bargain given the wonderful choices of appetizers, entrees and desserts offered. As a visiting San Franciscan, I found that Capriccio's provided a wonderful combination of excellent food, selection and service. I would definitely plan to dine at Capriccio's during future visits to Providence, Rhode Island.
April 17, 2013|A special night made perfect|5|The best dining experience since I came back from working in Europe. The service and attention we received makes Capriccio our new special place to dine.
April 15, 2013|Great Visit|5|The food and ambiance are great. This is our second visit. The Kobe Beef Carpaccio is the BEST!!!!
April 13, 2013|Fantastico!|5|Eccelente! Our waiter Francesco was superb, as was the overall culinary experience. I was there to celebrate my birthday with friends and really had a fine dining experience. I will definitely return, as there were too many items I wanted to try on the menu! Abbondanza! Highly recommended...
April 5, 2013|Great Restaurant|4|The dining experience was great. I was with a group of three others, and could not be more pleased. The wait staff was very friendly and seemed to know the menu very well. I had the Tenderloin Diane, and could not be more pleased. It was accompanied by a nice glass of red wine that matched very nicely. However, some one from my party had ordered the pork chops medium, but he received it as extra rare. Other than that, there are no complaints nor were there any complications. We have gone about four times other than this occasion and never anything bad. I would definitely recommend Capriccio for any occasion.
March 31, 2013|Dissapointed|3|The last time I went to Capriccio's men were in suits and woman were in dresses. This time I went for my 43rd birthday and men were in shorts, T-Shirts and sandals.Although I booked the reservation with info that it was for my birthday, nothing special was done. Last year I went to Morton's Steak House in Boston and I had a personalized menu printed for me waiting at my table {I still have it].I also received a complementary dessert [molten chocolate cake]. The year before I went to Ruth's Chris and I received dessert free. I was surprised with the little extras each time. This year I was very disappointed. The food was good. The ambiance was beautiful but the waiters looked bored. I had to ask my waiter to remove crumbs from my table :-[

March 15, 2013|Always a fine place to go|4|Always a fine place to go but they probably do well enough to enforce a dress code. Paying good money for good food should entitle one not to have to sit next to patrons who care enough not to wear white T shirts and grungy jeans. Wow, my sixth grade teacher is rolling in her grave looking at that syntax.
March 10, 2013|Annual night out with great|4|Annual night out with great friends. Great service and great food. Quiet atmosphere in dining area .. Waiter was spot on from specials to any plate we had questions about. Was a little surprised at cost of drink .. we drink .. on average $2-$3 more than other similar establishments. At the end of the night it adds up. The food and our waiter made or night.. as food for other tables came out and some dishes were done table side, every plate looked amazing ... we will be back.
March 5, 2013|Excellent as always!|5|Excellent as always from the service to the food to the presentation!
February 26, 2013|Disappointing. Has always|3|"Disappointing. Has always been a favorite, but they ran out of special Mahi Mahi at 7:20pm our reservation was at 7. Waiter told us to ""86"" the Mahi Mahi instead of an apology. I really wanted the lobster mash that went with it, which I told the waiter expecting him to say I could have it with the swordfish but he didn't offer. Swordfish was way overcooked, dry. Shrimp cocktail was room temp instead of cold. Ambiance is always great. To finish ordered a Bailys and coffee, but it was served separately. What happened to the fresh whipped cream? Overall disappointing and especially since we had raved about it to our guests that first timers. Too bad."
February 23, 2013|Classy and Excellent|5|This is our 6th time visiting Capriccios for a black tie occasion w/ our children. The overall atmosphere is warm and inviting and the wait staff was classy and professional. They even portioned our meals so the children could try everything we ordered. You truly think that Frank Sinatra will be walking thru the doors and dining at a table next to you. Excellent evening.
February 22, 2013|Top notch upscale Italian|5|Top notch upscale Italian dining. Steak Diane was prepared right at the table. Steak couldn't be more tender. Very nice place but you'll want to dress up a bit as its not casual. Waiter was exceptional.
February 22, 2013|Dependably Great Dining|5|I've officially lost track of how many times I've trekked down from the Boston suburbs to dine at Capriccio (perhaps twice a year for the past ten years). We head to Capriccio for special occasions and when we want to impress visitors. I won't bore you with detailed descriptions of the wide variety of dishes; they're all outstanding. The dover sole is worth highlighting, as is the veal San Remo. And you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. the restaurant is pricey (we spent $350, tip included, for four diners, with a combined total of four drinks and two glasses of wine) but the quality is well worth it. Along with al Forno, this is our favorite restaurant in Providence, and now our kids have started going there on their own!

The party of 10 was very loud and it definitely made for a less enjoyable dining experience for us. The service was a bit on the slow side but the server herself was very friendly and attentive, taking the time to apologize when the food/drinks weren't coming out in a timely manner. We still enjoyed ourselves as well as the meal though and would probably go back. I just will ask for a little secluded corner table for two!

February 16, 2013|Excellent, excellent, excellent!|5|Great food, great ambiance and excellent service! This place has never let me down. If you have a special occasion or if you just to have something much beyond the everyday, this is the place to go! The Dover Sole is the best I've had, the Shrimp Scampi Flambé by your table is absolutely delicious, the lobster - all amazing. Do yourself a favor and go, you will come back again and again.
February 16, 2013|I dined there to celebrate|2|I dined there to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary. I had the Beef Wellington, which I asked for pink (medium) but it was served well done. I also didn't enjoy the spread they put on top of the meat (the black truffles ruined the taste in my opinion, but I guess others like it). The potatoes and vegetables were also a bit overcooked. My husband wanted swordfish and asked to substitute potatoes for fries, which they refused to do (they said no substitutions, but he could order a side of fries for $6.00), so he ordered sirloin just so he could get the fries. I don't understand why they couldn't have accommodated this simple request. Our waiter was just ok, we didn't see him much. The valet parking was convenient.

Our most recent meal did not disappoint: The service, entrees, and ambience were clearly up to the task, and made for a very memorable birthday celebration for my wife. The Beef Weelington and Veal Oscar were perfectly prepared, and paired beautifully with a Chianti Reserva.

We both ordered veal oscar which was delicious and cooked perfectly. The waiter, Robert, was excellent and very attentive and surprised us with song and an anniversary cake. This was our first time at Capriccio and have decided it will be our ""new favorite restaurant""."
January 28, 2013|Providence's Basement Gem|5|One of Providence's most reliable culinary experiences, Capriccio always delivers from the servers to the plate. Tonight was highlighted by two specials off the menu: an ahi tuna that was divine and a veal medallions prepared similar to an osso buco. We had a great bottle of Brunello and made it two. Overall, Capriccio is hard to beat in Providence as a total package on most any night.
January 27, 2013|I took my wife and four others|3|I took my wife and four others to this restaurant for her birthday dinner. The food was excellent and everything else was fine except for the waiter who was abrupt to the point of being rude and made us feel uncomfortable.
January 26, 2013|Fantastic place. We went for|5|"Fantastic place. We went for Restaurant Week and I felt bad paying so little for the meal because they still treated us like ""real"" customers. Service was great, the food didn't take long and they were quick with the check business at the end. It's a very quaint atmosphere, vines along the walls, waiters all dressed up. I was full for the rest of the night after eating there."
January 25, 2013|We did go for restaurant week|3|We did go for restaurant week so that could be the reason our food was sub par. We were seated in a very inconvenient location with terrible lighting and not such a great environment (was next to a terribly cold vent). There was definitely a lot of noise from the adjacent tables. I did see potential for a great dining experience though so perhaps this was just an unfortunate encounter.
January 25, 2013|Lunch Date!|5|We decided on a whim to head up to the city from South County to take advantage of restaurant week and made a reservation for Capriccio. Our reservation was for 2:00 so we pretty much missed the lunch crowd and were seated at the best table which was right in front of the fireplace. The menu selections were all good so we had a hard time choosing but everything was fabulous but what made it special was our server Don who made our experience wonderful!

The 3rd person canceled and we were ready to order. Not sure if it was because it was restaurant week or if we were at a 4 top with only 2 people, but our waiter was surly. Not friendly, and almost rude. Food was good, had the mushroom crostini and arancini for apps and both were good. i had the veal parm and my girl had the eggplant and they were very good. We will probably try again, maybe the waiter was just having a bad day.

January 21, 2013|Still Great|5|"My girlfriend and I went for a ""girls night out"" when hubby was out of town. I had not been to this restaurant in many years and was thoroughly impressed that they had not missed a beat. Atmosphere was warm and cozy but what really stood out was the wait staff. Our waiter, ""Roberto"", was fabulous. He made great choices when we waffled, he split our calamari appetizer onto two plates with extra dipping sauce and lemon without being asked, and he was a treat to have as a server. Knew when not to bother us but always there with a smile and funny story when we were receptive. The food was outstanding, especially the calamari and the veal parmesan. The one item I would not recommend is the bread pudding. But, I will be back soon."

The only complaint they had was the significantly slow service - understandable on a Sat. night of Restaurant Week. We had noted the same slow service, however, even on Jan. 14 during a late lunch we enjoyed at your restaurant.

January 19, 2013|We had early reservations|3|We had early reservations as we were going to see The Million Dollar Quartet at the Providence Performong Arts Center at 8:00 PM. However, we arrived at 5:30 we ordered off of the Prie Fixe menue. I thought the server was overly anxious to serve us as we just sat down when he asked for drink order, really didn't have time to relax a second and take in the ambiance of this wonderful restaurant. Forgave that at first as I thought he was trying to help us eat and get there in time for the show, but he agressive service continued all through the meal, almost had the feeling of being rushed. I thought the seafood pasta dish was prepared well in advance and warmed up just before being served. Expected more.
January 18, 2013|We went for restaurant week|4|We went for restaurant week and the food was wonderful. The portions were so large that we had to take 1/2 home. Our table was not in the greatest location (near the door), it was very chilly all night. Our waiters were very nice but tried to rush us from the startby ask us for our drink order before we were all seated. We told them we weren't in a hurry and they slowed things down. Can't wait to go back!

December 7, 2012|We received a gift certificate|3|"We received a gift certificate to this restaurant, and probably wouldn't go back unless we got another one. The food, while of high quality, elegantly prepared and attentively served, was just over-the-top. All the specials for example, featured a ""sherry/cream reduction;"" there was a lot of rich food without much attention to fresh vegetables. The wine was also outrageously priced. The place was just too-too. I much prefer a restaurant like Gracie's or Bacaro."
December 5, 2012|Excellent!|5|Our server was excellent. She was extremely professional and very well spoken. We were quite impressed with our service. Very nice! The veal parm was as delicous as ever!
December 1, 2012|Off night|3|This has always been one of my favorite restaurants. Saturday was an off night, hopefully it was just a fluke and not an indication of the restaurant. My husbands steak was very tough, my fish was ok. The service was a bit slow but ok, except that the server forgot our appetizer and got the salad dressing wrong on my salad. I was really looking forward to a great dinner and was dissapointed.
November 30, 2012|Great Service!!|5|Our head waiter, Nick was awesome. One of my guests required Glueten free food. He was very familiar with the issues and without saying anything he was able to have the kitchen prepare a very nice meal for my guest. Superb service!!

November 3, 2012|First time dining at Capriccio.|4|First time dining at Capriccio. Food was as rated, Outstanding. The gentleman seating folks was less than ethusiastic about anyone joining them for dinner so that was a bit of a put off. However, that feeling did not last past the arrvial of our waiter. He was great. Very attentive, made good recommendations and was as timely and attentive as a waiter needs to be. Looking forward to eating there again.

They have clearly been doing everything right to draw repeat customers, like ourselves. And now that they are here on OpenTable, it is much easier to make a reservation!
October 20, 2012|Best restaurant in the world|5|Awesome from the service, to the setting to the food.
October 13, 2012|Not as good as they think they are!|2|I had made specific reservations with either a table in the corner or against the wall. Since my husbands stroke it is hard for him to concentrate to talk thus needing either one of those seating arrangements. When we walked in the receptionist had to consult with someone else so I knew right there we were not going to get a table requested. We were placed on an isle with the wait staff going behind each of our chairs to get to the table in the middle. We were bumped several times. When ordering I specifically asked how many oysters came for the appetizer. The answer was 6; we received 5! Piped in music was loud; food was just ok.
October 13, 2012|The ambiance is excellent|4|The ambiance is excellent for special occasion. Food is very good. Service is excellent. Crew are very friendly. Love the pasta special, a mixed of shrimp, sea scallops and lobster. The oyster rockefeller is delicious.

October 6, 2012|Too perfect?|5|Can a restaurant be too good? I go to a lot of very nice restaurants. It's hard to pick a favorite. I was given a choice of where I wanted to dine on my birthday. I chose to return to Capriccio. From the time you arrive and are greeted by the valets, welcomed by the host, and you enjoy a perfect dinner, you know this is one of the best. I like to write reviews of the restaurants I visit and I look for things to complain about. With Capriccio I draw a blank. There is nothing to complain about, it is perfection from beginning to end. The food, service and ambiance is as good as it gets. If you want a sure thing... Try Capriccio
October 5, 2012|Yum!|5|Cappricio always gets it right! Food is outstanding with enough variety to please any pallet. The service is beyond compare. Impressive.
October 1, 2012|We love this restaurant and|5|We love this restaurant and our young waiter Anthony was the best! We will ask to be in his section when we return. Thank you Anthony for putting up with the 6 of us!!
September 29, 2012|Meh|3|A bit kitschy, relying very much on the dark underground Italian shtick. Huge plastic plant arrangements gather dust in the corners while the overwhelming majority of senior citizenry clientele gather dust at the tables. The food is old fashioned and uninspired, but it is not awful. Wine list is fantastic.

September 22, 2012|Hadn't eaten at restaurant|3|Hadn't eaten at restaurant in a few years because it is pricey and it wasn't as good as we remember it. We went twice in the last two week, first for our anniversary and it was fair, and then again with friends to take advantage of the pre fix menu for $30, and it was nothing special. So many good restaurants in providence we won't be going back there.
September 22, 2012|I have dined here many times,|4|I have dined here many times, and as usual the food and service were very good. A special appertizer of grilled shrimp was outstanding. Only problem, my appertizer of Foie gras was great, but at $24.95, the portion should have been much larger. Barely a taste on the plate.
September 16, 2012|Awesome!!!!|5|The food was awesome, I can't find any reason not to go. I loved everything about it. Better bring your wallet, and I will say it was worth every penny.
September 15, 2012|Excellent food and service.|5|Excellent food and service. The list of specials was varied and made the selection difficult, a good problem to have. Portions generous and the spacing of the meal was nice.
September 15, 2012|The Royal Treatment|5|We were a party of 12. The service we received was an excellent team effort and success. We ordered a variety of apetizers, dinners, and wines. The service staff were all knowledgable, accommodating, attentative, friendly, and kind. The food was very special--sort of Iron Chef America variety, quality, and delicious. From the valet parking to the coffee and dessert, we were treated like royalty. Everyone had an exceptional time. Thank you Capriccio's for a truly memorable dining experience.

Unfortunately, this was the first time we were ever disappointed. My wife had the Prix Fixe dinner... The appetizer and desert were up to the standards we expected but her lobster was disappointing. Stick with the regular items and you will not be disappointed.

Dined on September 1, 2012|Very Disappointing Fist Visit|2|The food was good - my fiance's lobster special was excellent. My duck was just average. The Sorbet was excellent; tiramisu was good. The service was horrible. Our waiter seemed busy and preoccupied. He knew the specials as if reading from a script but when I asked for more details on the duck, he said it was good; he had never had any complaints. No other details. It was a while to receive our salads. we received our dinner and our waiter never came by to check on us. Finally the water 'boy' came to clear our plates and bagged up my fiance's leftovers. THEN our waiter came over to see how our dinner was. The maitre de/manage was walking around to ask people how their dinners were - except for us.

August 29, 2012|Mom Meet & Greet|4|Enjoyed that the restaurant extended their Restaurant Week prix-fix menu through Labor Day. Went on a Wednesday night and enjoyed the quaintness of the restaurant. Our reservation was for 7:30 and the restaurant had cleared out by that point, it had a nice and quiet environment. Food was appetizing with a great ambiance perfect for a date night or other special occasion (Ours being introducing the boyfriend to Mom).

The meal totaling $171.00 with tip and tax was far from exceptional in quality or presentation. The Amaretto dessert completely lacked the flavor of Amaretto. We also felt rushed by our serious, somewhat robotic waiter. We also received an email from Open Table the next day asking why we had not kept our reservation...maybe we shouldn't have!

The waitstaff was very attentive to our needs and did not rush our meal. The food was good, but not great. You could say the restaurant is somewhat overpriced for what you get. For instance the Clams Capriccio had six little neck clams baked in garlic butter, topped with bread crumbs served in a casserole dish with no fancy garnish except 2 lemon slices. This appetizer was $14.95. It was not impressive at all for the price. The beet salad was delicious and well presented. Fettuccine Alfredo was done table side and was good, but not great. I personally prefer a little garlic added to the sauce.

Six of us ladies dined early before a musical and the waiter was just great at taking our orders, offering suggestions and getting us out in time. The food was fresh and wonderful. Although there was a special menu that we all wanted to take advantage of he gave us the same wonderful service he gave his other customers. A great start to a terrific evening. Would highly recommend this restaurant.
August 14, 2012|Wonderful! Upon our arrival|5|Wonderful! Upon our arrival to Providence we went straight to Capriccio. We were greeted and seated immedietly. Our server Lindsay was pleasant, attentive and very helpful when we told her it was our first visit to the area. Our lunch was outstanding. Chilled gazpacho, scallops, shrimp, veal, panna cotta and tiramisu! Each dish delicious and fresh. Even the bread was fantastic. Definitely will return if we are back in Providence. Kudos.

I don't think I will visit this restaurant during lunch.

July 8, 2012|I went with a group during|3|I went with a group during RI restaurant week, so there was an option of ordering from a prix fixe menu, which we all took advantage of. I thought the purpose of it was to showcase the best of what the restaurant has to offer, but I guess not. The food was extremely bland and some of our selections tasted like they came from a frozen package (the tortellini was terrible). Most of our drinks were OK, but overpriced. The waitstaff was attentive and fast (flirtatious too, I might add - take that how you will), although it was very slow that night. The decor is tacky and cheap - artificial flowers and strings of xmas lights have no place in a restaurant where the waitstaff wear tuxedos. Bottom line: I expected a lot more for all the fuss.
July 7, 2012|excellent as always|5|As always the service and food was excellent. We ordered crab cocktail and smoked salmon to start for four adults. Not an easy appetizer to share, but Don and Michael set us up perfectly with individual plates of lemon and a delicious seafood dipping sauce. My husband ordered the gnocchi special which was outstanding (as I stole bites), I ordered a four cheese rigatoni pasta dish. I am not a fan of gorgonzola cheese and didn't realize how strong it was in this dish, but my husband thought it was excellent(we swapped food). Our friends ordered the fish special and pasta with Kobe meatballs...they were very impressed New Yorkers! What also impressed us all is the staff's ability to recommend amazing wine in the price point we chose. YUM!
July 6, 2012|Though the restaurant was|4|Though the restaurant was very busy the night we were there, we found the service to be exceptionally slow. We waited for 35 min for a table even though we had reservations. Once we got to the table, our waiter seemed overly encumbered by a few other large parties. Our meals were excellent; I had the best scallops I think I've ever had and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the veal porterhouse. He also was pleased to walk way from an expensive, elaborate meal completely satiated. Often, portion sizes can be on the lean side at upscale restaurants but that was not the case at Capriccios. Overall, we absolutely loved the food but wish we had been prioritized a bit more for the cost of the meal.

A very professional server who enthusiastically but not overbearing told us about the ""specials for the evening"" or anything we needed to know before making a decision. Certainly no one here would ask if you were ""still working"" on our food.....such a professional staff. The food presentation, taste and quality is outstanding. One feels like the establishment exists for serving your table. Expect to pay $130-$150 for two and you will be having one of the finest dining experiences available."

June 22, 2012|Although I have been to Capriccio|1|Although I have been to Capriccio on several occasions this was without a doubt the wrost experience I have had in any resturant in recent years. I was looking forward to taking my parents. They wanted to see my new place in downcity and then out for dinner. We were greeted nicely but from there it was downhill. We did order drinks and apps, but after that we did not see the waiter for almost an hour and then he said there was a large party and that was the reason for delay. The appetizers dishes did not get cleared for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I finally had to get up and confront the waiter after now one hour and forty minutes. Beleive me when I say I could of dealt with the situation, however, my father is very elderly. Horrible!

The House Specialties were imaginative. Oh yes...The cocktails were delicious. No wine that night, but the wine menu looked solid. It's clear that this restaurant takes their food seriously, and the waiters and attendants were there when you needed them...out of sight for the other times. The staff is ""professional'. No dessert bcuz it was my wife's BDay. They brought a small, delicious traditional birthday cake, without all the noise and embarrassment. A+!!"

We got one of the specials as an appetizer, and they plated it separately for all three of us before bringing it to the table. Now that's service! The shrimp scampi was made tableside (prepared by Gino) and was absolutely delicious, and the portions were generous.

Our reservation was for 4:00 p.m. The restaurant was busy but the maitre d was super polite and we were happy to wait in the bar for our table. Service was horrible. It took a full hour for the appetizers to arrive at the table. We waited for our salads and I had to complain to the maitre d. Our meal took 3 hours! We didn't get anything fancy, just ordered off the prix fixe menu. We would order a beverage, it didn't show up. We ordered coffee and dessert, only two of us got our coffee. Yikes! It was a nightmare!On the positive side - the food was fabulous! We loved it when it finally show up!

March 24, 2012|I would recommend Capriccio's|2|I would recommend Capriccio's for the food. We had reservations and still had to wait a half hour to be seated. Our server never told us the specials and got aggitated with my husband when he was taking a minute to decide on what he wanted for dinner. I have been to Capriccio's several times, mostly for lunch, and have always been treated with respect. This was the first time we had a bad experience with waiter service.
March 24, 2012|The timing and the presentation|2|The timing and the presentation of the food was very nice.There was no one at the maitre d' stand to acknowledge us for a few minutes. It was very busy but we stood there wondering what to do until a waiter finally noticed our bewilderment and announced some one would be with us momentarily.The food was only ok. Whipped potatoes were watery. The tomato sauce was delicious. The veal was blah. The oysters Rockefeller had too much sauce and not enough oyster.The most offensive thing, however, was to see a cook in a T-shirt and apron in the dining room of this supposed caliber. For Pete sake put on a chef's jacket when you come on the floor. If the guests require expected to wear jackets so too should the staff.
March 23, 2012|We have been to Capriccio|5|We have been to Capriccio several times and have always found it to be exceptional. I took advantage of the Restaurant Week Special of Kobe Beef Carpaccio, Lobster Fra Diavola and Chocolate Mousse. This was an incredible value at under $35! I didn't realize it was Restaurant Week and when I enquired about the Lobster our waiter suggested this option as an amazing combination. He was right. Our group remarked how this style of dining is becoming rare. Dark wood, quiet enough to converse, excellent and attentive service and outstanding preparations from the kitchen. We termed it (not too original) to be reminiscent of Old Style Refined Dining. If this appeals to you please give them a try.

It is consistently good - the food, the waiters, the valet parking and the coat-check are exemplary! It is, truly, our favorite restaurant. We look forward to going again.
March 2, 2012|When you step into the restaurant,|3|When you step into the restaurant, the ambiance of the place is very impressive. We came here for a birthday celebration and got a private room in the back. There were multiple wait staff at the ready to serve the 16 of us. At the beginning, they were top notch. After they realized we were not going to order their $200-$500 wine bottles, things started to change. Based from my friend's experiences in the past, the servers were usually very attentive. I did not feel like this was the case this time. There was a sort of arrogance almost to the point of rudeness. I have been treated better at normal restaurants. The service was disappointing and the food was just okay. It was good to try but I would not recommend unless you have $$$$

February 24, 2012|#1 restaurant in providence !!!!!|5|Incredible! We visit Providence a few times a year and this is the best Italian restaurant hands down! Beautiful, charming decor. Brick floors, warm atmosphere. The food is exceptional and the service is superb! They even have a limo that will pick you up and take you back to your hotel at no charge - just call ahead. This was especially convenient because it was raining.
February 24, 2012|1st Time Visitor.|4|As an RI resident I've always heard great reviews about Capriccio's. Great experience with great service and great food. Took advantage of their Restaurant Week menu - great value. Will be back to sample more of the delicious food.
February 21, 2012|I felt that the food and service|4|I felt that the food and service were top notch. However, the restaurant itself seems very tired and needs to be updated. It was like dining in someones basement. I would expect to pay their prices if their venue was worthy of it.

Capriccios is welcoming to families with creatively-dressed college kids as well as adults looking for a romantic and quiet dinner. We never feel rushed or pressured. Very enjoyable old favorite.

February 11, 2012|Is etiquette of fine dining lost|4|"This was our 5th time visiting Capriccios for Valentine’s Day with our children ages 10 and 8. We love the atmosphere, wait staff and food are fantastic. One thing I was disappointed with this year was the lack of respect the other tables with children had for the guest around them. We spend a lot of money on this evening to make it a memorable one for our children as well as to teach them etiquette of fine dining. I counted 3 tables with children using their I Touches and one boy wearing a hoodie with ear buds. I know times are tough in the restaurant business, but I feel (since parents won't), then Mgmt. should have the right to tell their guest that a Jacket is appropriate and “PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING PHONES AND ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT""."

The children were two five year olds and a seven year old and each received personal attention. Their meals were custom made to their wishes. As always, the meals for the adults were excellent also. This remains a favorite""special occasion"" dining experience. The atmosphere is elegant and inviting, very conducive to fine dining."

January 28, 2012|Fabulous Providence staple|4|Fabulous Providence staple that holds up to it's reputation. Service was the only small issue. It was good, but should have been great. We were missing our server quite often. Otherwise, the food and ambiance were outstanding. Definitely returning in the future for a special occasion!
January 28, 2012|Atmosphere was very nice.|5|Atmosphere was very nice. Loved the brick floors and the various stone walls. Restaurant Week prices brought us to the restaurant for the first time. Too pricey for us without the special pricing. Of course, the food was excellent! Four in our party and each tried something different; extremely satisfied.
January 28, 2012|Great food and pleasant atmosphere|5|We went during restaurant week, so the meal was a great value, but I think the regular menu was priced well so I wouldn't hesitate to go back on a normal night. Everyone at the table ordered something different for their entree, and everyone was pleased. The Dover sole was notably good, as was their veal parmigiana. The waiter was quick but we didn't feel rushed, and the dining room had a warm, comfortable ambiance. On the whole, we had a fantastic meal and would definitely return to Capriccio.
January 28, 2012|Mostly good - then lost steam|4|Dinner was very good, as always. I had veal parm, which was wonderful. The arancini was fantastic. One diner didn't like his meal-not because there was anything wrong with it. It just wasn't his style. But we had lost the attention of our server by the time this occurred. (He was tied up with a large party at the next table.) We weren't able to request changes without making a fuss. We decided to let it be rather than stir things up. We sat for 15-20 minutes after finishing dinner before coffee, dessert or the check was offered. I'm assuming the service slow down was due to a rough night because I've always had great service as well as excellent food at Capriccios before this experience.
January 27, 2012|i went for restaurant week.|3|i went for restaurant week. the place was very nice but the food seem to be rushed and not wonderful. i expected better from a restaurant with such a name.
January 27, 2012|not Impressed|2|Not a very good experience from the moment the valet took my keys. - I don't know why the valet personnel have to be arrogant. - The host and the server (both male)took a very Indiscrete look at my wife from head to toes. flattering but indiscrete, not what I expected at this restaurant. - Food was mediocre quality, not what I expected - The restaurant is nice but it has unattractive detail such as, electrical extensions hanging from the ceiling and walls, other electrical tubing (conducts) very visible in the ceiling (not nice)
January 27, 2012|Capriccio review|2|I had made reservations, allowing 1 1/2 hours for dinner before seeing a play that night. The waiter asked us if we had plans after dinner when we got seated and said he would make sure that everything would be served on time. We ordered a bottle of wine a an appetizer, but did not get our dinners until 20 minutes before we had to leave. We had to rush our meals and when I asked to get the leftovers to go, he never brought them and we did not have time to wait for them. Although the food was very good and the atmosphere was nice, the entire meal was ruined due to poor service.
January 27, 2012|Was there for lunch, after|1|Was there for lunch, after 90 minutes we were served only salads and drinks. We were forced to take our entrees home, which certainly affected the quality of the food. I asked for Diet Coke, was served Coke, asked for the mistake to be corrected, and the mistake was made again. In stark contrast to the service, the restaurant itself is an absolutely beautiful place.
January 27, 2012|Fantastic food and very attentive,|5|Fantastic food and very attentive, old-school service where the staff treats you as a guest, not just a patron. Definitely a nice treat - and during Restaurant Week it's an incredible deal!

We loved the discovery of ""Buratta"" cheese (mozzarella with a soft creamy center) served with an appetizer special! Ambience, food, wine and service, all paired beautifully...as always at Capriccio's."
January 19, 2012|The service is always outstanding.|4|The service is always outstanding. The waitstaff is very attentive. This time the food was amazing. The mozzarella from Italy was like nothing you have every tasted. It melted in your mouth! We had the red snapper special and the rack of lamb. Both were delicious. I had the Dover sole before and would not recommend it.
January 18, 2012|This was my first time here|3|This was my first time here - the restaurant was empty and my husband and I sat at the bar. The food was good - but not outstanding for the price. I had a gift certificate that helped with the bill a bit...but there are other more affordable and romantic places to eat in the area. Probably won't be heading back.

January 12, 2012|As usual everything was wonderful.|5|As usual everything was wonderful. I just love the old world, European flair. My husband had clams casino as an appetizer - wonderful - and the tableside Shrimp. Fun and very well done. I had the gnocchi special - butternut squash with dried tomatoes, walnuts in a brown butter sage sauce. One would have thought the gnocchi would be heavy and gooey but they were dense but not gooey or heavy. Wines were perfect accompaniment. I had the ricotta pie dessert and it was light like a mousse and very easy to eat at the end of the meal. Service is always unobtrusive and perfect. A nice evening had by my husband and myself.

January 7, 2012|Excellent meal and service|5|Nice ambience. We enjoyed the lemon sole; it was cooked perfectly, fresh, and the serving size was generous. The desserts are also very good, but we would have preferred smaller sizes!
January 7, 2012|Top Notch Dining Experience|5|This was our first visit, and we truly enjoyed it from the moment we walked in until we walked out the door. The wait staff is very attentive, the food delicious (lots of great choices), extensive wine list and romantic ambiance. It was really a nice evening.
January 6, 2012|It seemed like a washed-up|2|It seemed like a washed-up Ritz Carlton and was greatly overpriced. The decor needed updating and the head waiter was a drill sergeant. It was fine, but I wouldn't go back.
January 6, 2012|a long-time favorite, still a treat|5|Capriccio has been a family favorite in recent years. My kids feel welcome no matter how wild or casual their attire, and get the respect their good behavior and foodie questions deserve. The table-side service is rare these days and fun to watch, and eat. The renovated space is cozy and sumptious..and there are subtle sound-dampening aspects that help keep the dining areas quiet. We're fans!
January 6, 2012|Just an ok lunch for $85!?|3|We had an Open Table $50 coupon for $25 which made our bill end up being $35 including the tip, which is pricey for lunch at $85 without the coupon!. The food was fair, we had tuna steak and scallops for entres. The tuna was supposedly sushi grade but was just average, the side of haricot ver was tasty but under done and the sauce had been sitting since it had begun to have a skin. The scallops were large and tasty, however. The server was good, a little quiet spoken considering the noisy lunch crowd. I have had better experiences here at night for dinner, and am having dinner there next Friday and I will sure to post a review then.
January 5, 2012|We have been to Capriccio|4|We have been to Capriccio several times and always enjoy the dining. The food preparation is creative and always pleases our palate. If I had to be critical I would say that, while their wine list is extensive, it could use some less expensive selections in the red wine grouping. There are many very good reds out there that shouldn't cost over $100 per bottle.
January 2, 2012|Wonderful for a special occasion|5|Wonderful for a special occasion dinner; nice place which requires one to dress up formally is really a treat. The service is very proper. The wine list is overwhelming and a bit pricy.

December 29, 2011|A Must To Dine, Cappriccio|5|I now reside in Philadelphia the last 25 years after growing up in East Providence. I always tell anyone traveling here that Providence its the cleanest city with great buildings and a lot of great restaurants. But the two restraunts you must have dinner is Capriccio and Camiell's hands down. I have travel to other city's thar have great restaurants and even in Philadelphia where I'm from now has a lot of great restaurants, but nothing compares to Capriccio and Camiell's in Rhode Island. I always book resversations here when I am back and look forward to it. I was at Capriccio on Thursday night 12/29/11 and it was decorated for Christmas and looked amazing! Tonight New Years Eve I am at my other favorite Camiell's. Joe Burkhardt

Both the veal scallopine and veal parmesan were very generous portions and wonderful! The parmesan was perfectly breaded and crispy. Attentive but not overbearing service. Our romantic evening was started at Cappriccio!
December 26, 2011|See and be seen|3|interesting iconic Rhode Island dining establishment. A place to see and be seen. The food is average...from my last dining experience here, I believe that there are better Italian restaurants in this fine state. My fish was very fishy and only so so. Not what I have come to expect when dining here. I will say the seafood salad appetizer was phenomenal. The wine list is okay, but the selection is somewhat limited and the prices extreme.
December 21, 2011|The best|5|"We have been going here for over 25 years and have never had less than an outstanding experience. We have dined from San Francisco to Venice and there has been no place better. Clearly superior to any of the more"" famous"" places in Providence, including Fox Point!"

December 17, 2011|We were seated promptly.|4|We were seated promptly. The food was very good; Clams Capricci, fried squash flowers, Veal chop stuffed with a lobster stuffing, and almond encrused striped bass. It was quite crowded for the holiday time so service was a tad slower than one would expect, however the secondary staff were always prompt with water and bread.
December 10, 2011|Been going here for over 20|3|Been going here for over 20 hrs. Always a good place during the holidays to people watch. Food was good as was service but out table was right near the galley area and horrible. Our guests wore their coats it was so cold. There were plenty of other open tables so you have to wonder why they seat you at a table like this.
December 10, 2011|We went to Capriccio early,|4|We went to Capriccio early, before a show, and it was quite busy as there was ballet, a play, and a concert in Providence that night. We skipped the apps but had salad and dinner. I ordered a special of shrimp and scallops in an artichoke cream sauce over linguine, and it was absolutely delicious! Our waiter was very good. There were a couple of larger groups in the room, but we enjoyed our table for two.

November 27, 2011|This restaurant is a great|5|This restaurant is a great place to enjoy a quiet evening with excellent service. I would strongly recommend their version of beef wellington. It was served and presented in a special way. The one negative comment I have is that this restaurant needs to enforce the dress code which encourages men to wear a jacket. The couple next to us were dressed in sneakers and jeans and looked like they were going no where special. If you are going to give the impression that this is an elegant restaurant follow through by enforcing the dress code!
November 26, 2011|Overall our experience eating|3|Overall our experience eating at Capriccio was what we were expecting. The food was excellent and the service was good.

Best Italian bread anywhere(if you like real crisp thick crust). Lamb shank special, and pancetta wrapped jumbo shrimp over risotto fantastic! I definitely would return to try more dishes. Waiters and assistants welcoming, helpful and attentive. Extensive wine list very expensive (reds $50 - 350+); need some value selections.

The server was very friendly, knowledgeable about the food and extremely attentive. Even on a busy Saturday night, I'm amazed at how smoothly everything is run. My two favorite dishes at Capriccio - Beef Wellington and Tenderloin Dianne were exceptional, as always. Loved the poached pear dessert. This is what a great restaurant experience always ought to be like. They could teach some of the so called fine dining establishments in any metro city in the U.S. a lesson or two.

October 14, 2011|Due to the focus on service|4|Due to the focus on service Capriccio can come off as a bit stuffy. After an initial onslaught of various service providers moments after we sat down, things evened out and we had a nice and relaxed meal. The food is good, trending towards traditional Italian but w/ an effort to be creative. Our waiter was attentive but not overly so. Wines are a bit pricy but there are decent bottles around $50-60 if you look. The only suggestion I have is to cut down on the length of the specials. They went on so long that it became a bit uncomfortable how long our waiter stood by our table reciting them. I began to worry that I was no actual written menu. Luckily I was wrong.

You don't feel like they are rushing you out. The wine captain picked out a perfect wine to match both our dishes. Dining here isn't cheap, but it's not excessive for the dining experience. I'd say good value for the money. This was my 3rd trip. It was my birthday and I could have dined anywhere. Capriccio was my first choice, I'm glad the date and time were available!

October 1, 2011|Exceptional food and service,|4|Exceptional food and service, as always. Pricey but worth it for a special night out. The Steak Diane really is their specialty. I had the Dover Sole again but it wasn't as good as the last time I had it here but still very good.
October 1, 2011|This place is my new favorite.|5|"We really liked this one! The wait staff are pros, no ""Hi guys I'm Todd your best friend"" here. We set the pace for dinner, the lighting and noise level was good. She started with octopus and me with Manhatten clam chowder. Then she had sushi grade tuna and I had stuffed sole with crab, all specials. All were excellent. We had 3 drinks each and the bill was 160, less than I expected and worth it in my mind. The only minor complaint from her side of the table was no garnish in the martini. The valet parking is very nice too."
September 29, 2011|Capriccio restaurant always|5|Capriccio restaurant always exceeds my expectations. The atmosphere is wonderful, the food is exceptional and the service is always superior. More importantly the restaurant is very accommodating to the needs of its patrons and will modify it menu to meet the needs of its patrons. The restaurant is great for lunch as well as any special occasion. I highly recommend Capriccio to anyone looking for fine dining in Providence, RI

September 24, 2011|The food was quite good, but|4|The food was quite good, but with so many other restaurants with excellent service, we wouldn't hurry back. When we arrived at the maitre'd station, there was no one there. After a few minutes a man walked up to the door where we were, held it for someone, then just looked at us. After quite a few uncomforable seconds of staring at one another, he asked if he could help us. We really weren't sure who he was as it appeared he was wearing a regular suit jacket which was different from the waiters. Our waiter was courteous and pleasant but definately rushed us. There was no time between courses. As soon as our salad was finished the main course appeared. If we wanted to have a leisurely meal, we would find some place else.

September 16, 2011|This restaurant was very nice.|4|This restaurant was very nice. We ended up having to change reservation and they were very accomodating. Food was excellent. It was a little more formal then we generally aim for, but they recommend men were jackets, so that should have been expected. Overall a very nice experienc.

If you are staying at a hotel dontown and want to add something special to your evening... (or a suprize), they sent a strecch limo to our hotel to bring us to the restaurant, no extra charge. It made a nice birthday dinner a little more special.

September 4, 2011|We actually went twice over|4|We actually went twice over the Labor Day weekend as they had the most amazing deal: a prix-fixe menu for only $29.95 which included lobster! The first night (Friday) it was just the two of us and it was perfect, romantic and quiet. The second night (Sunday)we brought another couple and it was much busier. Service was still great. The only issue was the fire alarm going off for about 10 minutes! The prices are high but it's worth it for the entire experience.

August 26, 2011|We had not been to Capriccio|5|We had not been to Capriccio in a a couple of years and were very happy with our experience. The service was a bit slow with our initial order of drinks but from there the evening was wonderfully paced. The meals cooked tableside (alfredo sauce made at the table and scampi) were amazing. One of the more memorable meals, relaxing and well paced. Our reservations for 5 were at 7:30 and we waddled out closer to 10. My boys all said this was perhaps their most memorable meal, the food was just outstanding.
August 26, 2011|Gorgeous inside. Very romantic.|3|Gorgeous inside. Very romantic. Service was great, although I kept feeling like the waiter was trying to upsell me. The food was not that exceptional. I basically got fried chicken. I was disappointed that there were no chocolate options for dessert (I got the 3 entrees for $29.99 special). For how much our meal cost, I wouldn't go back. I expected to be blown away by the experience, and I wasn't. Food was just okay. Plus, I was disappointed that we couldn't get any wine by the glass, since my husband and I have different taste in wine. There were some little things that I felt could have been classier- like have dipping oil instead of butter for the bread. Waitstaff was exceptionally friendly.

August 20, 2011|A Perfect 10 !|5|Easily the best in Providence, probably one of the best in the country. From the valets that take your car, to being seated and then served, the service is as good as it can be. Food is creative and outstanding. The host and servers are happy to see you and strive to make your dinner memorable. The owner is passionate about his restaurant. The service, food and decor are excellent (as good as Spago or Blue Ginger). The staff seems proud of having the best restaurant as well. There is no room for improvement, Capriccio is perfect! Great wine list, reasonable prices.
August 20, 2011|An Old Providence Favorite ?|3|With the waiter in a Tuxedo and an extensive but expensive wine list this should have been a First Class Restaurant. I always hope to feel welcome, an invited guest, I did not. Service was attentive but snooty, especially after presenting my Open Table discount certificate. My wife had the Filet which was large, tender but tastless, my Beef Wellington was delicious but the aspargus was undercooked, crisp and bitter. There is no wine by the glass list tell them the type you want and they bring what they have. We were there at 5:30 and the restaurant was empty, if the dining area was full it would be quite crowded and possibly noisy.

August 12, 2011|Worst service ever|2|Food was quite good, however, the night was spoiled by the worst service ever experienced...the valet, the maitre d, and worst of all...the waiter. Can't believe how rude the entire staff was from the moment we walked in. We eat out regularly and have never experienced anything like this. Unfortunately, we were celebrating a birthday but it was very hard to overlook the waiter's attitude and feel celebratory. The night was ruined. If you're looking for a great meal AND want to be treated well, go elsewhere. Capital Grille and Ruth Chris know how to treat their diners. Capriccio needs a lesson in doing so.
August 8, 2011|My vote for the best restaurant|5|My vote for the best restaurant in Rhode Island. Consistantly excellent! Can't beat the Steak Diane prepared table side.

August 5, 2011|Excellent Dining Experience|5|Me and My Girlfriend had one of the best meals we have had in a very long time! From the Service to the food 5 stars! Not to mention I have eaten at the finest restaurants all over the country! This is the only restaurant where they would cook certain dishes at your table! I had the Steak Diane and my girl ate the Milk fed Veal Parm!! Unbelievable is all I have to say about this place.
August 3, 2011|Excellent Restaurant, Great Service|5|Gino the Captain was fabulous.

July 21, 2011|From the moment we arrived|5|From the moment we arrived the service was great. We (party of 3) had Thursday night reservations at 9:30 p.m. The restaurant was only moderately busy at that hour so the staff made sure we had plenty of attention without being over-bearing. All food dishes (appetizers and main course) were prepared to exacting standards. It was a very relaxing evening.
July 18, 2011|Capriccio's Fit for a King!|5|This was my favorite newphew's 12th birthday and he will have a great memory for years to come. Thank you to all the staff for all your fine work. One little thing, you should be aware that Opentable diners receive checks to use towards future meals at Opentable Restaurants if they eat out frequently, as we do. I know it was the first week that Capriccio's had the Opentable, so using the benefit checks were not accepted that evening. The waiter claimed he could not get hold of the owner so he delined accepting them, but the restaurant staff should be made aware of these checks. We have been using Opentable for years, and we had two checks which were about to expire and they were not accepted. Other than that, it was a very fine meal!
July 18, 2011|I had been to dinner at Capriccio's|5|I had been to dinner at Capriccio's once before and it was a memorable experience. The food presentation is beautiful, as well as tasty to eat. I was not disappointed on my second visit.
July 16, 2011|Overall pretty good. It may|4|Overall pretty good. It may have lacked some of the polish that some of the otter high-end places have, but I was treated fairly and got what I asked for. Had the couple next to us not used so much of the waiters attention, we probably could have done 4 stars there too. They did recognize that it was our anniversary, which was nice. I would go back as I would love to try some of their other entrees and wines.
July 16, 2011|Great meal and superb service|5|My wife and I spent a week in Providence and ate at many great restaurants, and Capriccio was the absolute best. So good that we went back twice to try other items on the excellent menu. Wonderful service, perfect meal from appetizer to desert.
July 15, 2011|Comfortable bar/lounge area|4|Comfortable bar/lounge area for pre/post dinner drinks. We split the Arugula salad which was delicious. My husband had Beef Tenderloin & Wild Mushroom Risotto which was amazing but Shells Bolognese that I ordered was just ok. I've had much better bolognese at Dolce Vita in North End of Boston & shells didnt really make sense with it. I should have ordered either the risotto dish or Capellini Cardinale (which is w/lobster) which i had the previous time that we went & was amazing. The wine suggested to us was slightly more money than we would usually spend but well worth it, the Nebbiolo - Langhe 2007 for $53.50. We didnt order dessert or after dinner drinks. Overall a very nice dining experience for a special occasion dinner.
July 15, 2011|Revisited during Providence|3|Revisited during Providence Restaurant Week and found the food and service were both good but was very disappointed with the extremely high wine prices, so much so we did not order a bottle with our meals. As wine usually compliments our food choices the lack of it due to the price points made for a flawed dining experience. Perhaps this explains why on a Friday night during Restaurant Week the place was not packed like other Providence restaurants.
July 14, 2011|As always, Capriccio was top|5|As always, Capriccio was top notch. The proscuitto, melon, goat cheese, and fig appetizer was amazing!!!
