Camille's was all that and so much more. The ambiance, service and food make Camille's a destination restaurant. Don't miss it!

February 19, 2016|A place to Dine!|5|This restaurant is certainly a dining experience. The staff all around made us feel special and treated us as such. The food is incredible!!
February 18, 2016|oldie but goodie|5|"We have gone to Camille's a few times over the past 20 years and have never been disappointed. The service is always outstanding. The wait staff is very attentive but not ""in your face"". The decor is beautiful and males you feel like you are in a very special place. The food could not be better. This time I ordered the lasagna which was quite ample in quantity and absolutely delicious, made with Camille's own home-made pasta sheets. My husband had the filet mignon which was cooked exactly as he ordered it and was tender and tasty. My friend had a seafood special that she said was the best of its kind she had ever eaten. The dinner was pricey but well worth it."

February 14, 2016|Great!|5|Went here for Valentine's Day 2016 with my husband. I had the lobster ravioli which was red heart shaped pasta and he had the filet mignon and they were both great. It is a bit pricey but very worth it for the quality and the romance. The server was always checking on us and so polite. The only reason for the 4 star ambiance is the tables are all right side by side so you are sitting next to strangers and have to talk over them. If you can handle that it is an awesome place to be.
February 14, 2016|Great food and atmosphere|5|Dined there for Valentine's day. What a great meal. Food and service was both outstanding. Its a perfect place for special occasions and celebration or just a nice night out. Moderate to high to price range, but worth every penny. You must go and try it for yourself.
February 13, 2016|Historic gem in Providence|5|Stunning service. Great food. Lucky to get a reservation. A bit too packed for me, but it was a wonderful dining experience.
February 12, 2016|Special Evening - Special Place|5|My wife and I dined here celebrating Valentine's Day. We have been here several times and tried many different dishes. Never a disappointment. The food was superb, the service fantastic and the evening was special! Cannot recommend this restaurant any higher - simply the best food in Providence and the service is just as remarkable.
February 12, 2016|Exceptional evening|5|Food and service was excellent, our server was professional and courteous. I would recommend Camille's for a romantic evening
February 11, 2016|Good old fashion food|4|Nice place, way of cooking is little old fashioned. Big portions, lots of oil ans salt. Overall nice expirience .
February 5, 2016|Awesome|5|Very nice place. Entertainment was fantastic. Food was very good. Waitstaff was top notch.
February 4, 2016|Welcomed a group|5|We went here for a going-away dinner for a group from the office. Everything was handled well from start to finish...literally. My wife and I arrived about an hour early and were welcomed to sit in the lounge. There we were served by Steve, the same server who handled us in the dining room. He took care of us as our guests assembled. and once everyone was there led us to our table in the dining room. One of our guests brought a young son and Steve arranged for him to get chicken fingers and fries. Everyone else had the traditional Italian specials and all were praised. My wife particularly loved her crab cakes, which she said were the best she had ever had. Camille's is definitely a jewel for Providence on Federal Hill.
January 30, 2016|Romantic Dinner|5|The food was outstanding, the service was awesome and the overall experience was great. I would definitely recommend Camille's to all my friends and will definitely dine here again soon.
January 30, 2016|GREAT DINNER|5|AS ALWAYS CONSISTANTLY A GREAT DINNER & GREAT SERVICE. THE BEST!
January 29, 2016|Good place for a good meal|5|This was a last minute reservation and it had been a while since I was at Camille's but I must admit the food the drinks and the service were all fantastic, I had the calamari (must have) the grass feed ribeye with a truffle mash my buddy had the pork chops very good (big flavor) and the girls split Sea Bass and a Gnocchi. go hungry the portions are very large. I will be heading back sooner then later.
January 26, 2016|Excellent food & service!|5|Our waiter was fantastic! Very knowledge about the wine list and made a very nice recommendation without 'breaking the bank'. Food was delicious! Looking forward to going back.

January 21, 2016|Food was good but soup was warm not hot|4|We went for work lunch for 6 people and took almost two hours and wasn't busy, too long! Also very cold had to put coat on to keep warm. First time at restaurant but willing to try again.
January 20, 2016|Providence Restaurant Week|5|Camille's was an outstanding choice for food, service and ambience. What a value for Restaurant Week!
January 19, 2016|Providence Restaurant Week|5|Felix was awesome! Very attentive and excellent suggestions!!
January 15, 2016|Camille's|4|The service was impeccable. We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner, our server was very knowledgable and able to help with a gluten free meal as well as making excellent recommendations for cocktails. The meal was delicious and served in a timely manner and cooked to perfection. This was my first experience to this Providence landmark and looking forward to future visits. Thank you!
January 15, 2016|Camille's never disappoints|5|Nice place for dining with friends- good food, good service, no hustling.

January 2, 2016|Best of Providence!|5|Camille's is not just the best restaurant on Federal Hill (which says a lot), but the best restaurant in all of Providence! My wife and I had dinner there on Saturday night and everything - from the Oysters to the Special Seafood Casserole - was fantastic! Cooked to perfection and paired with impeccable service. We will be back again and soon!

December 31, 2015|Happy New Year's Eve Lunch|5|Two couples from CT headed to Providence, RI to celebrate New Year's Eve. We had one opportunity for lunch and looked for a great restaurant on Federal Hill since a restaurant on the river had been recommended for dinner. We found one in Camille's. We had a relaxing, delicious meal in a beautifully decorated setting. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and specials and made helpful suggestions. Antipasto salad, risotto special, and special soup of the day were outstanding. Every meal that passed by us and went to other tables had us oohing and ahhing also! Our leisurely lunch was far superior to the dinner we had later that night at another restaurant. We are looking for a reason to go back to Providence just to revisit Camille's.
December 26, 2015|Great food, excellent service!|5|The atmosphere is warn and inviting. The food is great with an excellent selection. The service is professional. I highly recommend!
December 18, 2015|fantastic|5|We went last year around this same time and the food was fabulous. This time around it was the same amazing experience. We are sure to make Camille's the destination of our yearly Christmas dinner. Be prepared to splurge though... it is not cheap; however, the service is awesome and the portion sizes generous. Mangia mangia!!!
December 18, 2015|A gem.|5|From our arrival to our departure, the experience was outstanding. Loved the menu, the sauce, and the specials. The food presentation was creative and alluring. The basic lasagna was the best I've ever tasted, and the meat and fish dishes were off the charts. The service was congenial, but with attention to detail . So much so that I remembered Chris and George our hosts and Steve, our wiater. It was an incredibly comfortable experience and will be back soon.
December 12, 2015|Five star|4|Five star food and service, attention to detail, went after 9pm for a late dinner date - too noisy in dining room- band in bar area horrible and way too loud- music choice awful for a Sat night- i should have booked an earlier time so my bad- food superlative and service second to none- presentation a work of art, waiter great- i will go back at a quieter time!
December 12, 2015|Extremely professional  and attentive staff!|4|The ambiance is fabulous - the décor is lovely - the bar is decorated beautifully and the music was excellent! There was dancing and professional, friendly and attentive staff. The food was wonderful on my first and second visits - not so much on my third. We had a party of 8 and only 3 of us enjoyed the food. The filet mignon is wonderful - Each of the 5 people in our party who weren't so thrilled about the food had a seafood dish....
December 5, 2015|Oh my!  You can not find a better place....|5|Oh my! You can not find a better place. Can't wait to go back.
December 5, 2015|Incredible Dinner|5|The food was prepared perfectly, drinks were perfection, dessert was simply amazing. Service could not have been better. You won't be disappointed in this restaurant.
November 28, 2015|Excellent outstanding restaurant|5|I have been here twice and it is by far one of the best places i have eaten. Both outside dining and inside dining is amazing from the staff, to the food, to the atmosphere.
November 27, 2015|One of best Italian restaurants I  ever ate at!!|5|Fantastic, excellent service and deco.r. A++++ Waiter Dino was attentive, professional and a gentleman!! He also provided a great restaurant for us in Newport the next night!
Dined on November 20, 2015|Everything was perfect.  Thank you.|5|Couldn't have been better. It was a perfect night for our special occasion.
November 20, 2015|OUR FAVORITE|5|As always, Camille's doesn't miss a beat. Dining room is gorgeous already, holiday decoration steps it up. Food, service, wine list have never let us down.
November 17, 2015|My New Favorite!!|5|The whole experience at Camille's is both comfortable and upscale. The service is impeccable. It is a warm and inviting space. There are no words to describe how AMAZING the food it!! You can not miss order here. This has become my hands down favorite. Just make sure you leave room for dessert!! SOOOO good.
November 14, 2015|Excellent Night|4|Camilles was a short walk from our hotel and the reception was excellent when we arrived. We were seated a few minutes before our actual reservation. The salads were outstanding, one with arugula and prosciutto, and the other one of the best Caesar salads we had ever tasted! The main courses were excellent also. Enjoyed the night very much!
November 14, 2015|Still walks the walk for great food.|4|Great place for her birthday dinner, as always the Hill comes through! From the Valet parking to the great meal, it is one of our top 5 of all time.
November 13, 2015|This was a high end treat for us and the...|5|This was a high end treat for us and the value more than measured up. Ambiance was perfect for conversation. Service impeccable in the highest traditional standards. Food was excellent from first to last course in taste, quantity and presentation. We will be back for the next celebration.
November 13, 2015|Seafood pasta was disapointing|3|Had the seafood pasta with white wine sauce. Very bland.
November 12, 2015|Excellent dinner and service!  Everythin...|5|Excellent dinner and service! Everything was described well and cooked to perfection. The manager was very welcoming and wished us a happy anniversary (from the note on our OT reservation). We will be back!
November 7, 2015|SAT NEXT TO RON PERLMAN FROM SONS OF ANARCHY!|5|Our favorite restaurant. Camille's sets the standard for service in our little state. Regular menu items are always excellent, Sole Almondine special was delicious, not sure it needed the added capers. Best calamari anywhere, the bar was hoppin with lots of stuff going on in town. Bonus to be seated next to Ron Perlman from Sons of Anarchy on this visit.
November 6, 2015|Terriffic|5|We have visited several restaurants in this area and this is the best of the bunch. This visit I had the lasagna and it was great! Very complex tastes and plenty of food. We will be back.

October 31, 2015|Good food ,big portions and  high price.|4|Good food ,big portions and high price.
October 31, 2015|HALLOWEEN SATURDAY|5|It is always such a pleasure to dine at Camille's. The service is gracious, professional and unobtrusive, the wine list is one of the best in the state, and the food is reliably excellent. General Manager George recommended apple fritters (like doughnut holes with filling) for dessert. Cooked fresh to order, they were warm, cinnamony, and just crisp enough on the outside. We should each have had an order instead of just splitting one, but we knew we'd be going home to Halloween candy. Really great live music in the bar with lots of people in costume, the whole night turned out even better than we expected it to.
October 29, 2015|Making a choice on this menu was tough. ...|5|"Making a choice on this menu was tough. Everything sounded incredible and what we ordered between apps, entree and dessert was phenomenal. There were no ""wrong"" choices to be made. Service was attentive and consistent throughout the night. We never felt forgotten or neglected by our server. Everything was top notch!"
October 27, 2015|Camille's - Not For The Financialy Challenged|5|The restaurant is a great place to bring your significant other for a romantic night or to celebrate a special occasion. The waitstaff are friendly, the food is excellent, although not economically priced.
October 26, 2015|Tourist|5|Camille's was recommended to us as the oldest and best Italian. After checking out the menu we decided to try it and we loved it. Food was excellent and very large portions. Pasta was fresh, veal was tender and calamari was very tasty
October 24, 2015|Dissapointing|3|We arrived before our 8pm reservation and were not seated until 8:20. We were a party of 4. The veal masala and the lasagna we excellent but the rigatoni alla norma was mushy with not a lot of flavor. We did decided to split a dessert and I think the waiter forgot about us. When we called him over he got snippy and had an attitude the rest of the way. We will not be going back.
October 24, 2015|Great dining experience|5|The service and the food were absolutely fantastic . We were visiting my daughter at college and took her and a few friends out for dinner. We all had a wonderful meal here, and would definitely go back the next time we are in providence.

October 23, 2015|Fun Birthday with the Adult Family|5|Food was great, wanted to try more thing but portions are very big!
October 23, 2015|TWICE IN ONE WEEK|5|Thanks for another greart meal Camille's, everything was perfect as usual, love the higher-end wines available by the glass on that preservation system thing. We had such a great meal Tuesday that we came back Friday! Wonderful from start to finish, best service in town.
October 20, 2015|Old Friends|5|I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen in a while for dinner. Camille's was our first choice. Perfect setting, great services and excellent food. We will be back soon.
October 19, 2015|food was decent but very expensive for quality.|3|The atmosphere was nice and the service was quite good. I got chicken Parm and it was certainly OK, but not anything special and fairly pricey given that it was average to good. Definitely recommend it but I thought it was overpriced for a moderate quality
October 19, 2015|Dissapointing|3|My husband and I wanted to go somewhere special for our anniversary. I've heard people mention what a wonderful place Camille's is so we decided to try it. The valet service was a nice surprise. The inside was decorated beautifully and the ambiance was quiet and romantic. Unfortunately the food and staff were another issue. I ordered the veal special. The veal was delicious but my vegetables were luke warm and some were over cooked and some almost raw. My husband ordered the ribeye but while the waitstaff was adding red pepper flakes he over shook it on the steak then said oops then walked away. My husband tried to brush off as much as he could, but it was too spicy. The waiter apoligized and put in for another steak. Unfortunately because mine was already on the cool side by this time, I continued eating. His didn't come out till I was done. So much for a romantic dinner. The hostess did comp us dessert, but by that time our waiter seemed impatient and not nearly as pleasant as he was when we sat down. He actually rolled his eyes when I asked for coffee! We suddenly felt uncomfortable and unwanted. I know we will ever be back.
October 17, 2015|Amazing service but a little disapointed with meal|3|Let me start by saying the food wasn't bad by any means. I just expected a little bit more. The calamari and beat salad were delicious. My filet mignon tasted a little too charred on the outside. It look away from the flavor of the meat. My husbands veal parm was good, but not even close to the best we've had. When you pay the fine dining prices, you expect an unbelievable meal. The service was outstanding though. I would go back for drinks and apps. The atmosphere was fun and romantic.
October 16, 2015|Amazing time|5|Brought my parents here last Friday for dinner. And everything was amazing. They have an amazing menu and have an exquisite wine menu as well. Server couldn't have been nicer and manager checked in periodically to make sure we were satisfied.
October 16, 2015|Never disappoints|4|Camille's is always a sure thing for good food, good service and an outstanding atmosphere.
October 14, 2015|Absolutely the best!|5|Service was professional, ambiance relaxing and elegant, food was out of this world!!! Iron chef quality with specials that are creative and unique
October 10, 2015|Camille's delivers!|5|Excellent dining experience with fantastic service and delicious Italian cuisine.
October 3, 2015|Service is Superb|5|Was a great choice for an anniversary dinner. While the wine selections were quite pricy ($40 and up), the ambiance and food quality was sublime. Our sever was young but had a great grasp of a rather complex menu and never seemed overbearing or pushy. We were treated to a dessert of cannoli to celebrate our special day, without any prompting by the wait staff. Highly recommended
September 30, 2015|Outstanding, as promised|4|Went to Camilles based on reviews, and I was not disappointed. Amazing food and great service. The pork was one of the best I have ever had.
September 30, 2015|A good time was had by all|5|Our guests were treated with terrific customer service, from seating, to menu choices and selections. The wheelchair ramp was a great addition for those important elders who meant to much to our guest of honor. The food was terrific, choices were delicious, our guests were so happy. Kudos to you!
September 29, 2015|A nice find|4|Came here during a recent stay in Providence on the recommendation of a B&B owner in New Hampshire where we had stayed the day before. Really enjoyed the food - veal porterhouse for my main was outstanding. Overall a very pleasant night out.
September 29, 2015|Best in Providence|5|I don't know what was going on in town on this particular Tuesday night but Camille's was full of large dinner parties. Even so, the waiter was fun, efficient, and knowledgeable about the food and the wine list. The swordfish special was over-the-top delicious. Such a great spot for a date, we're going to try Christmas Eve this year too.
September 29, 2015|great experience|5|Everything from service to food was beyond exceptional. Will be sure to return for dinner.
September 29, 2015|Short and Sweet|5|Just a quick lunch today, even skipped the wine list (it wasn't easy). Service and food were excellent as always
September 29, 2015|Client Lunch|5|Camille's is my favorite spot for business lunches. Valet parking means no driving around in circles and the competent service can be counted on.
September 28, 2015|Only thing missing was John C...|5|Only thing missing was John C...
September 26, 2015|Great place|5|The food was good. The service was even better. Great wine selection and delicious cocktails. The staff are amazing and friendly.
Dined on September 26, 2015|The restaurant is beautiful.  It's like ...|5|The restaurant is beautiful. It's like something out of an old mafia movie. Food and service do not disappoint.
September 26, 2015|Camille's Is Top Notch|5|From the time you arrive at Camille's, you know you're in a special place. The service is exceptional. The food is so beautifully delicious that we all finished even though we were full about halfway through. A treat for your palate.
September 24, 2015|Great lunch!  Took a first time client h...|5|"Great lunch! Took a first time client here. Staff was excellent. Great service and our food came very quickly! They realized that we were on our lunch ""hour""! Made it back to the office for our next meeting with time to spare."
September 22, 2015|Terrific Tuesday Night|5|Our go-to spot when we want attentive service, a great meal, and a great bottle of wine in a beautiful room. Fresh pasta with lamb ragu was the hit of the night. Thanks again Camille's!
September 22, 2015|Second dissapointment on a Tuesday Evening|2|"Want so much to like this place but our last two experiences, both on Tuesday evenings, were very disappointing.......service was robotic, and the food was not well prepared. We raised the issue on the shrimp appitizer, and the server's lack of empathy or concren shut us down.... Very, very disappounting......... Too many other great choices in Federal Hill, to give them a third chance...... To the credit of the front end Manager, he chased us to our car, encouraging us to return....but unfortunatly....""Elvis had left the building"" thank you ...and good night"""
September 21, 2015|Classic Italian Food|4|Right in the middle of the Federal Hill district. Decor and ambiance like stepping back in time. Food was classic Italian and very good. And the service was helpful and attentive.
September 17, 2015|Great Federal Hill choice!|4|We really enjoyed Camille's. The inside is beautiful but we chose to eat outside because it was a lovely night. It isn't quite as pretty to say the least and it's where they allow smoking... but the food was superb and the service excellent.
September 16, 2015|Great first time at Camille's|5|I had a very pleasant time at Camille's. I had dinner with a friend and we were able to eat, drink and have a nice conversation with a quiet atmosphere. Prices are reasonable, food and wine were excellent. I will certainly be back
September 12, 2015|"Great service
Excellent food"|5|Great service Excellent food
September 12, 2015|Italian all the way|5|As someone who's grown up with pure Italian Grandparents and having actually been to Italy knowing what real Italian food tastes like, this is definitely a place to have great food.
September 12, 2015|Enjoyed the whole experience.|5|There was 6 of us dining. We had a nice round table so we could all talk and hear each other. We had delicious food, great conversation and terrific service. We were not hurried. Two people shared 2 items. The waiter brought them separate dishes already divided. They probably ended up with more then half. Portions were generous? I had a swordfish special. It came with shrimp, which I am allergic to, so they willingly suggested scallops. It was outstanding. The dish included spinach and a wonderful sauce. It was all good. We were too full for dessert. We would go back!
September 11, 2015|Best night ever|5|Another wonderful experience at Camilles. Great food, great wine, best service in the state. George is a wealth of wine knowledge and came by later to make sure we were enjoying his recommendation. Can't wait until my next night out at Camilles!
September 11, 2015|BACK FOR MORE|5|Such a great experience last week that we came back for Liz's birthday. Champagne this time, lobster casserole to die for, and the spot-on service that we love. Things are offered or just there before you have to ask, sometimes even things you didn't know you wanted!! Dessert on the house for the birthday girl is always a classy touch. Thanks to the gentlemen at the front door for such a nice table, we will see you soon.
September 8, 2015|Dissapointment|3|We went to lunch on August 8th and as we were about to order our waiter London said that they had a Lobster Casserole Special, he went into detail of how it was prepared and how good it was. We both ordered it as it sounded great. A few minutes later he came back and said there was no Lobster Tails and therefore the dish was unavailable and asked that we order something else. We were both very disappointed. You would think he would know the dish was not available before giving us all the build up to it. You would also think he would of offered a free glass of wine and or desert . No one other than the waiter and the waiter he was training came by to ask how our mail was. The Service was also very slow!!!
September 5, 2015|Camille's Doesn't Miss|5|Any time I want to impress anybody, Camille's is the go-to spot. Disappointed they didn't have the squash flowers, but a seared tuna appetizer with heirloom tomatoes made up for it. The filet and the bolognese were both excellent, and went great with a bottle of 2005 Brunello. The other thing that really sets Camille's apart from everyone else is the service, front to back. Servers are knowledgeable and professional, and Managers take time for a little personal attention no matter how busy the place seems. Bartenders, Valets, whatever-all are polite, cordial, helpful. Thanks Camille's for another very special evening.
September 2, 2015|Disappointed|2|Slow service wouldn't have been as much of an issue if they weren't freezing us out with excessively cold temperatures! They ruined our experience. Food was good, but most definitely not worth the prices charged. Lesson learned, I suppose.

August 29, 2015|Anniversary flop|4|"Camilles has a more upscale vibe than many other restaurants on ""the hill"" so seemed a good choice for an anniversary dinner. Ambience and decor definitely live up to the upscale rep but not the food. Risotto balls were terrible having almost no flavor. Even our server mentioned he often got complaints about them and removed them from our bill. Truffle fries looked and tasted like they came out of a frozen food bag. Veal parm and lobster tagliatelle were OK but not what I expected at those prices and hype. With so many better choices on Federal hill we won't be going back. It should be mentioned however, that our server was excellent and the highlight of the night."
August 29, 2015|The whole experience was amazing.  This ...|5|The whole experience was amazing. This restaurant has it all: ambiance (inside and outside on the deck), great service (David), excellent food, and delicious drinks!
August 28, 2015|Always excellent|5|We always look forward to an evening at Camille's. The food is always well-prepared and hearty. It doesn't matter whether you order meat or fish/seafood, you know it will be excellent. And the contorni are always done exactly right.
August 22, 2015|Best anniversary dinner yet|5|Went with my wife to celebrate our 61st anniversary. Everyone took superb care of us, the valet car parkers, the hostess who helped me arrange for flowers at the table, the waiter who took all the time we needed to discuss the menu, the manager who figured out how to load a huge vase of flowers into our car so it wouldn't spill. The food was prepared exactly as ordered and was fabulous.
August 14, 2015|You get what you pay for....|5|Excellent food (Filet Mignon and Lobster). The calamari and sangrias were great too!
August 14, 2015|GOOD FOOD ON THE HILL|3|Being a nice summer day, we asked for a table on the patio. It was very nice, cozy, ample. Our waiter Stephen was knowledgeable, friendly, courteous and polite. The meal was good, I had the rack of lamb special with crab cake and it was nice, but not the best I've had. My BF got the pasta bolognese and it was good but not great. Our friends got seafood dishes and they loved them.... I guess seafood is the way to go here. The service at Camille's is very attentive and non-intrusive. The food is good and the ambiance, very nice. A good choice on the Hill.
August 13, 2015|Opus One Wine and Waiter Alan Were Fantastic!|5|We enjoyed the shrimp fra diavolo and andouille swordfish. Server was Alan -- gracious, attentive and knowledgeable. No need to over-think which Italian place to visit here -- just pick Camille's!
August 8, 2015|A great night|5|Tried out Camille's for 35th anniversary. Couldn't have found a better place. From the valet parking to the waitstaff, the service was superb. Eric, our waiter, was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. We each had a different veal dish. The meat was very tender, the gravy was flavorful, the portion were very large and the presentation was great. They even threw in a free dessert to celebrate the event. To top it off, the guy in the next table got on his knees and proposed. Everyone applauded. We will definitely come again and bring the family.

July 25, 2015|Always a hit!|5|Camille's has been around forever but as impossible as it seems, each time I visit, it gets better and better. the atmosphere, the food, the drinks, the staff; everything is great. The outdoor patio is great! You would never know the highway is within a mile from where you are sitting.
July 24, 2015|Definitely go once|4|An old school RI classic that still has good food and the charm of a classic place from an other era, Wines by the glass are a bit limited and to try anything that you don't buy for home will definitely cost you. Service is very attentive without being overbearing. Good variety in the breadbasket and a lot of variety in the menu. Slight downgrade for offering somewhat lesser versions of dishes for restaurant week (other high end Hill spots use more of their real items) but if you didn't look at the whole menu you wouldn't know and both pork and fish dishes offered were well prepared, seasoned and presented.
July 24, 2015|ca ching ca ching!|5|went for restaurant week. pre fixed 3 course meals at $35. $210+later...ca ching ca ching! excellent food (except if you're trying to be healthy...VERY rich), good service from London.
July 20, 2015|Excellent food & service|5|I had lunch w my 97 year old aunt during restaurant week. The food was excellent, especially the chicken escarole soup & chicken parmigiano. David waited on us & I would definitely request him again.
July 18, 2015|Perfect|5|Our dinner was perfect! The food was amazing. I would definitely recommend the homemade gnocchi. Our server was very helpful and did a great job recommending an appetizer and bottle of wine. We will go back again soon and have already recommended to friends.
July 18, 2015|Best of Providence|5|By far the most authentic Italian mainstay on Federal Hill. A absolute win every time for lunch or dinner. Great food, classic atmosphere, and excellent service.
July 18, 2015|Wonderful experience|5|Great food , service, and a place who wants and appreciates your business.
July 17, 2015|Wonderful experience|5|We were traveling through Providence and wanted to experience a Federal Hill Italian restaurant and settled on Camille's based on TripAdvisor ratings. We were not disappointed. Everything about the evening was excellent. Our waitstaff was incredible, very personable and attentive. We were pleasantly surprised to find we hit Restaurant Week, which turned out to be a great value as well. Every course was delicious and generous. We couldn't have been happier. Highly recommended, especially for special evenings.
July 17, 2015|Lunch At Camille's|4|3 of us met for an early lunch on a special price-fix menu for Providence Restaurant Week. The appetizer featured Beefsteak Tomatoes that I don't believe were genuine, no taste. The 3 different entrees, yielded two very good ones and a chicken ceasar salad where the chicken was overcooked. The service and ambiance were A+. I would go back.
July 11, 2015|Great Spot!|4|The food was excellent as was our server London. He was very attentive and quick with any requests we made on a pretty busy night. The only complaint we had is that the stuffed a lot of tables into the dining room. It was very close quarters with other tables surrounding us. Overall I would not hesitate recommending Cammilles for a nice night out.
July 11, 2015|Still One Of The Best|4|My wife and I recently had dinner at Camille's Roman Garden. I am from the area originally, but Have not lived in Providence for the last ten years. I remember the restaurant from before, so when we were making plans to visit RI, my wife requested to eat at a Federal Hill restaurant. Since the area has changed quite a bit, I looked at a lot of reviews for the area restaurants, and Camille's was frequently mentioned. We were not disappointed. The service was outstanding, as was the food. We had Fried Zucchini Flowers for an appetizer. My wife tried the Veal Piccata, which was a menu item. I had the Veal Porterhouse steak, which was a dinner special. Both were perfect! Unfortunately, we were not able to manage dessert because we simply could not eat another bite. But the offerings looked delicious. As the waiter said, the pastry chef has one of the easiest jobs at the restaurant since not a lot of people are able to manage dessert. If you are going to Federal Hill for dinner, consider Camille's Roman Gardens. It has been around a long while, and for good reason.
July 11, 2015|First time for us and we found it Excellent.|5|Veal and Shrimp dishes were excellent. Highly recommend. Great service Valet Parking great service easy in and easy out.
July 3, 2015|Delicious|5|We were visiting from Florida and a friend recommended this place. It was a great find. The calamari was delicious! I would recommend this place for anyone who appreciates quality Italian food!
June 29, 2015|Old World|4|Old world charm with good food and great wine list Excellent service. Very large portions.
Dined on June 29, 2015|Classic & Classy|5|"As they celebrate 101 years in business, I can see why. This restaurant is worth the drive. I doubt there is anything on the menu that is not great. It is just so hard to pick from the huge menu and then when you finally decide, they surprise you with and extended amount of specials. Between getting what we ordered and seeing what other customers ordered, I wish I could spend a week there trying everything.. I decided on try a classic ""Veal Parm""; which was the size of the plate (very large) and delicious. The sauce and the amount of cheese was perfect! Was thrilled to be able to enjoy it for lunch the next day also. My company enjoyed the Shrimp Scampi; which after a taste myself have to say it was the best I ever had.! And we also enjoyed the Shrimp appetizer along with the crab cakes. Can't wait to go back again."
June 27, 2015|A great night out|5|From the time that we dropped the car with the valet until we finished the evening the service was excellent. My wife had the veal parm. which she said was the best and I had a special of the day, a fish stew. It had calamari, scallops . shrimp and halibut in a red sauce that was so good. I hope they have it on the menu for our next visit. Last but not least Mike the manager is the best. He lent me his reading glasses on our previous visit as I had forgotten mine.
June 27, 2015|Great Experience, the food was supurb.|5|Enjoyed our Camille's experience. Wait Staff was attentive and professional and the food was fantastic. In the main area bar, we did not have a great experience with the bartender...not helpful or as professional as she could have been. Messed up two orders on our drinks and didn't want to make it right. That said, I am still giving a five as the entirety of the experience overshadowed the bar tender's shortcomings.
June 27, 2015|We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The ser...|5|We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The service is second to none. The wait staff is polite, courteous, and right there to meet your needs without being intrusive. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The menu is extensive, the specials are truly special, and the wine list is excellent. We will definitely be back!
June 26, 2015|7th Wedding Anniversary Dinner|5|"My wife and I always have dinner on our anniversary at Camille's since this is the place I proposed to her. We arrived early so we could have a drink at the bar and was greeted by the bartender who in conversation ended up knowing him and his family from the ""old"" neighborhood. After the drink, I had asked for a nice quiet table to be seated at. To our surprised it was the same table we sat at when I proposed to my wife 8 years ago. The waiter Antonio was excellent, greeted us with a Happy Anniversary. During the whole dining evening he and his helper made sure made sure we had everything. The apps and the dinner was excellent. After clearing our dinner plates and to our surprise Antonio brings out a piece of chocolate cake with the words Happy Anniversary written on the plate. Compliments of Camille's, what a great surprise. The Matri D even came over to the table while we were eating our desert to see if we had a nice time. He even gave us his card and said ""anytime you want to dine at our table just ask for table 44"". What a great night we had and would go back very soon."
June 26, 2015|Outstanding Italian food|5|Great ambiance & service. Good wine list Couldn't be better!
June 25, 2015|Great staple in Providence.|4|This restaurant is everything you expect great food great service great scenery great experience. I eat out roughly 3 to 4 times a week for work and this restaurant is just consistently great.
June 25, 2015|Our night was amazing!!! It was our firs...|5|Our night was amazing!!! It was our first anniversary, & Camilles catered to our every need! To start off, they have valet which was great because I drive a big truck & I hate parking it myself. When we got inside, the host (might have been the manager) wished us a happy anniversary and sat us to our table where there was a candle already lit and menus already on the table. We sat in a private area with curtains on either side of us, but we were still included with the other guests in the main dining room which we liked! We started off with the jumbo shrimp wrapped in prosciutto, which originally comes with 3 but our server gave us an extra one (for a small up charge) since we were splitting it. IT WAS DELICIOUS! I loved it and my boyfriend really enjoyed the glaze that came on it as well. We also ordered two glasses of champagne to celebrate, and our server immediately brought it over. For our entrees, I ordered the Bolognese... HUGE. Worth the price because I now have leftovers to eat for two meals. James had the veal Marsala and really enjoyed it. He ate the whole thing, but had some leftover side of linguine and red sauce. Then... THE DESSERT. Complimentary chocolate cake which was as rich as rich could be! It was delicious, and James' sweet tooth was satisfied. For the service.. GREAT. Not only did the host/manager wish us a happy anniversary multiple times, so did our server without us having to say anything. Our servers name was Scott & I would highly recommend him! He did not linger around our table, but instead came at exactly the right moments. Very attentive to our needs, & knew exactly what he was talking about with specials. Even the young man who watered and bread our tables (I believe his name was Josh) wished us a happy anniversary. When we were leaving, Scott told us how great we looked! Loved it! We absolutely LOVED our special night shared with the wonderful restaurant & will be back again for our special occasions!
June 20, 2015|New Favorite Restaurant|5|"Camille's has so much to offer - a great bar with innovative drinks and an impressive wine list, fabulous food, and a beautiful interior. We arrived a bit early and were wowed with a delightful Pinot Noir and interesting ""Italian"" Manhattan in the bar. I had Zuppa alla Portoghese (little necks with chourico in a tomato/garlic sauce). I order this often, but this was my favorite - just enough spice to keep it interesting without being overpowering. My friend had the seafood special - a shelled lobster (1 1/4 lbs), two huge scallops, shrimps, and king crab in a delightful lemon sauce. It was more than enough for 2 people. We were both stuffed, but ordered the crème brûlée to share. It was fresh ... still warm and creamy. Camille's is beautiful inside - dark reds and mahogany ... making it a very romantic place to enjoy. Most impressive - we were seated 20 minutes after our reservation time and the service was slow. Once I spoke to the GM,George Kilborn, he corrected everything - and made us very happy that we chose Camille's and look forward to dinning there again."
June 18, 2015|Lunch at Camilles|5|Took my office out to lunch. great food excellent service - would highly recommend!!!!!
June 13, 2015|WOW!|5|The entire staff were warm, welcoming and very friendly. We were early for our reservation and had good cocktails at the bar. We sat outside on the patio and had Tom as our waiter. He was knowledgeable about the entire menu. His recommendations were honest and helpful. When our water glasses were half full, the staff would discreetly come over and fill them, without asking or having to chase them down. It was such a quiet spot for dinner. The food was beautifully plated and melted in our mouths. I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to everyone!!!
June 12, 2015|Best place on the Hill|5|The host Mr. Conti was excellent recommend coconut risotto and where to party after dinner..

June 6, 2015|CAMILLE'S ROCKS!|5|"Even on a busy Saturday night, the service doesn't miss a beat. From the greeting at the front door to the ""thank you"" on the way out, Camille's is a class act."
June 5, 2015|Excellent food. We had both fish special...|5|Excellent food. We had both fish specials and they were fabulous. The Bananas Foster Crepes were the best crepes I've had outside of Paris. The service was tremendous. Always available when we needed assistance and kindly divided a few menu choices we chose to split.
June 4, 2015|Great dinner celebration...|5|We recently celebrated a family member's birthday at Camiles... My family have been patrons since the 60s! It was my husband first time there and he, having worked internationally his entire senior executive career, is very discerning. He was impressed with the ambiance, the menu, the wonderful food, and the great service. We all were. I would say this restaurant consistently delivers fine dining in a very comfortable and elegant manner... We have vowed to visit Camile's each time we are in town...
May 30, 2015|Always outstanding service and cuisine!|5|Always outstanding service and cuisine!
May 23, 2015|Fabulous fare|5|This is a classic gourmet Italian establishment serving excellent pasta, meats and seafood. Each course had very good flavors with excellent accents and combinations. Much lighter than your typical Italian food found in America but still delivering Italian flavors that meet and exceed expectations. Seafood lovers will delight in the offerings from the menu and that days specials. The side dishes and desserts were just as delightful as the main courses. Our party of four enjoyed the highest quality flavors and textures throughout our dining experience but be prepared to pay accordingly.
May 23, 2015|overall experience|3|The food was excellent with great flavor, the portions were very small and the prices were also very high.
May 22, 2015|Good, but below expectations|3|Food was decent, but overall experience was very good. Classic, old world fine dining experience. Presentation and service was fantastic, but food was not up to par.
May 21, 2015|Our go-to spot|5|Nobody does it better than Camille's-it is our go-to spot for date night and entertaining friends. Management is friendly and engaging, the service is top notch, the food and the wine are the very best in town.
May 16, 2015|fantastic dining experience|5|Delicious mouth watering food, excellent and courteous service, extensive drink and wine list in an absolutely beautiful setting.
May 13, 2015|Camille's is our favorite place in Providence.|5|Camille's is the prettiest place. It is warm and cozy with professional service. It is our favorite place in Federal Hill. It very well could be our favorite place anywhere, and we are spoiled New York Cityers.
May 10, 2015|excellent, immediate, courteous service|5|Menu includes something for everyone. Beef cooked to our preference & liking.....delicious and decent sized portions.
May 9, 2015|THE BEST OF THE BEST !!!|5|Camilles on the hill is without a doubt the best restaurant in RI.. I would even venture to say all of New England. The staff is friendly and attentive, they make you feel like family. The presentation and the food itself is absolutely amazing, from start to finish... this is a world class dining experience.
May 2, 2015|Excellent Providence Experience|5|This one of the best meals that I can recall. Everyone in our party of six was very happy with his/her meal. There are a wide range of choices so that most tastes can be accommodated. As a group, we did not account for the atmosphere of the restaurant which is upscale and dressier than we anticipated. Although we were under-dressed for the venue, all of the staff were very gracious. This is a place that I look forward to going back to when I am better prepared to take in the full experience. Very nice overall experience
May 2, 2015|Taste even outdoes the presentation!|5|Haven't been back here in ages and finally decided to come back for a birthday dinner. The menu is extensive and not heavy in any particular direction...sometimes a menu will have an abundance of seafood but not a lot of pasta dishes. This is pretty even. But after looking it over, almost everyone changed their mind when we heard the specials! There were at least six specials offered that night as well as a couple of specialty drinks. Try the squash blossoms for a starter, yummy. I had the scallops saltimboca and it was outstanding. The presentation on every dish was worthy of a photograph, but the taste was even better. Great, friendly service...attentive but not hovering, talkative but not chatty, knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Highly recommend you give it a try!
April 24, 2015|AWESOME|5|Food, service, ambiance was all top notch! We went here during out Honeymoon and we couldn't have asked for a better night out...food was fantastic, service was top notch......we would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Providence area!
April 16, 2015|Exceptional Dining Experience|5|If your looking for an exceptional dining experience , Camille's , in my opinion , can't be beat. The menu is diversified and will leave any diner with a selection of their liking. The wine list is extensive with strengths in selections from Italy and California. Camille's is the go to restaurant for a memorable dining experience.
April 14, 2015|Enjoyable Night|5|We dine here a few times a year. As usual it was an An all around wonderful experience. Bartender and staff knowledgable and pleasant. Exceptional cuisine.
April 13, 2015|Early Dinner|5|Camille's never disappoints-early dinner this time around. Phenomenal veal porterhouse, terrific bottle of Barolo. Service attentive as always, enjoyed meeting George at the front door.
April 11, 2015|Poor service.|3|"We have been to Camille's before and it was very nice. This time, however, it was not. Very poor bar service. Waiter for our table was good but it took way too long for us to get our drinks. We ordered wine just before our main meal arrived and did not get the wine until well after we finished. Excuse was the ""bar as backed up."" This is no excuse for a Saturday night - TO THE RESTAURANT I SAY - ""HAVE MORE STAFF ON A SATURDAY NIGHT!!"" Also, the restaurant was very crowed and they had the tables on top of one another. I could not move my chair without disturbing the person at the next table. They jammed the people in and then did not even have the staff to handle it. Terrible exxperience as we will not be going back to Camille's again."
April 11, 2015|Excellent service, meal and ambiance.|5|Celebrating our sixth anniversary, we were both more than satisfied with everything about Camille's. The wait staff was professional and attentive. The waiter knew the menu and specials. The portions and food were excellent. The complementary dessert for our anniversary was a nice surprise. As always, we will be back.
April 10, 2015|My Go-To in Providence|5|For great food and atmosphere, Camille's is the place to go. The only downside of the experience is only having room for one of the delightful and inventive entrees. With with trained and engaging staff, I couldn't have wanted anything more.
April 10, 2015|Nice place to dine...|4|Ordered lamb well done and it came medium well. Free desert due to mix up. WILL RETURN...

April 7, 2015|TOP OF OUR LIST|5|Finally got back to Camille's, and we were away far too long. The very best high-end Italian restaurant in New England. The specials always rock, the service never misses a beat, and the wine list is deep in hidden gems. The John Dory filet was to die for, and we never, ever skip the Shrimp Santiago appetizer. Thanks again Camille's, see you soon!!
March 26, 2015|Great food-mainly had the specials. The ...|5|Great food-mainly had the specials. The experience and service was amazing. Jason our server was probably the best waiter I've ever had. I would go back just to experience that service again.

From the advance reservations, special requests, the food, the service, and the atmosphere, the staff at Camille's were fantastic and the experience unmatched. Thank you for making our birthday celebration very special.

Bar was quiet but resturant section seemed very busy. If in this section of town again federal hill I will stop in for dinner prices were very reasonable then most others on the hill.
Dined on March 14, 2015|Loved it!!|5|Both the food and the service is over the top excellent!!!!!
March 7, 2015|Absolutely Superb!|5|Camille's extensive menu, delicious food, beautiful presentation and superior service are the best we have had anywhere. Everything was superb! This restaurant is spectacular in every way and should not be missed. It was worth the 90 minute drive! We will be back again and again.
March 2, 2015|Another Great Night|5|Can't get enough of this restaurant. Brought friends this time around. Great food and fantastic service. We did a pasta course in between apps and entrees and it was a perfect addition.
February 20, 2015|fabulous food, fabulous service!|5|fabulous food, fabulous service, large portions. very welcoming to children - we were celebrating our daughter's performance, and she was made to feel very special
February 17, 2015|I had a Buisness lunch meeting|5|This was my first time here. From the Valet to the Waiter they could not of been nicer. I had Lunch with a friend and asked if we could order off the menu, which was not a problem. The Service was great and the food was outstanding right down the cheesecake for desert. We will absolutely be back.I highly recommend Camille's!!!
February 14, 2015|valentines day date|5|me and my best guy frind went to Camille's for valentines days and I was absolutely blown away at the service. every waiter made sure to tell me happy valentines day and make sure we were having a great time. the complimentary vallet was amazing as well as the food was outstanding! I would 1000% recommend this resturant and I plan on going back. at the end of the night the resturant have me a rose and personally walked me to my car because of the snow. they went above and beyond to make our dinning experience grand.
February 14, 2015|Carol & Bill|5|Everything was excellent. This was our third time visiting the restaurant. We will go back as often as we can.
February 13, 2015|Fabulous Find|5|From momment we walked in the door, the service was impeccable!!!! Our entire dining experience was wonderful, very romantic, perfect for Valentine's Day!!!! The food was amazing and generously portioned. I would definitely go there again
February 10, 2015|stuck in the 80's|3|I don't think this place has updated their decor or their menu since 1985 - but they seem to have had no trouble increasing their prices
February 6, 2015|another great meal|5|I've been dining here more and more, its always well done. Had a quick, delicious lunch recently, great service, very comfortable dining room. Spoke to George regarding a future reservation in the private room; he couldn't have been more helpful or better informed, thanks again.
February 4, 2015|Old World Charm|5|My wife and I frequent Camille's whenever we visit Providence..NEVER DISAPPOINTED. The menu has great classics and always numerous fresh dinner specials to choose from. The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. It is a great experience.
February 3, 2015|TOP OF OUR LIST|5|"Camille's remains the very best ""destination restaurant"" I've been to, no matter what part of the country we are talking about. The service is always impressive, the dinner specials and wine selections are at another level entirely when compared to other local restaurants. Shrimp in prosciutto appetizer is not to be missed! Lamb over vanilla sweet potatoes was melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful, and went great with a 2007 Super-Tuscan we'd never heard of but were happy to try at $85.00. Thanks for another great meal Camille's, we'll see you soon!"
February 3, 2015|QUALITY TRADITIONAL ITALIAN FOOD|4|GREAT QUALITY FOOD COOKED THE OLD FASHION WAY& VERY HEALTHY PORTIONS. THE WAITERS ARE EXCELLENT, VERY ATTENTIVE AND PERSONABLE. THE DINING ROOM IS WARM AND RELAXING. THE WINE LIST IS EXCELLENT WITH A SUPER VARIETY FOR ALL BUDGETS.
January 28, 2015|Great service food not so much|4|The service was wonderful, from the valet attendant to the waiters, but the food was not. My husband and I ordered Chicken Marsala. We each had a piece that was tough we could not even cut it with our knives. And for the price we should have been able to cut it with our forks. Pasta also was questionable. Very watery and not much of it.
January 23, 2015|overated and expensive|1|I was so looking forward to having dinner here from all the great reccomendations this place received. Restaurant was a little too dark. Service was fine until we wanted to pay for our bill. Our server disappeared. The veal chop special my sister and I both had was so over cooked and chewy we hardly ate it. The waiter must have thought something was wrong when we both declined to have it wrapped to take home and said desserts were on the house. We also found out that at the veal chops were $45 each when the bill came!!!!!!! If it was good I wouldn't have minded paying but it was bad!!!! If I could rate this restaurant no stars I would but the rated system didn't allow it
January 17, 2015|Providence's Best Italian|5|This is a true dining experience from the moment you step through the door. The atmosphere is calm, subdued and sophisticated with tables placed in a way to give space and privacy. Wait staff greet you immediately and provide an explanation of the menu and the specials for the evening. A huge amount of wines by the glass are offered as well as an extensive wine list by the bottle. Staff are well schooled and profesional. Expect the unexpected as the chefs use the best of ingredients in creative and unusual ways to enhance the flavors of the food. It will be a meal you won't forget.
January 17, 2015|Another Great Experience|5|This is the second time that my wife and I have dined at Camille's. Once again our experienced was awesome. We were seated at table that offered some privacy, but still allowed us to enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant. The service was great all night with multiple wait staff members catering to our every need. The food was delicious and certainly met our expectations for this fine establishment. We'll surely be back again.
January 16, 2015|the food was fabulous and the service ex...|5|the food was fabulous and the service exceptional.
January 14, 2015|#1 Italian in PVD in this diners opinion|5|Discovered Camille's last year and loved it. Decided to bring some very good friends who are foodies and they loved it! All four of us had excellent meals, the wine was delightful and the service was impeccable. I give Camille's my highest recommendation. You will not be disappointed!
January 14, 2015|An excellent lunch|5|I went to Camille's for lunch today and had a fabulous experience! It was very nice - from the valet who whisked my car away, to the warm bread and olive oil put on my table shortly after we sat, to the crusty bread meatball sandwich, to the beautiful ambience of the restaurant.
January 13, 2015|Birthday dinner for the bride!!!|4|Went there for a birthday dinner for the bride, It happened to be restaurant weeks. Service was very nice from the valet all the way to the coat check girl. The appetizers we had seemed to be lacking a little flavor, but the dinner was very good my wife loved the Sheppard's Pie and the veal was also very good. The cheese cake with raspberry sauce was good. Overall it was a nice evening and I would like to go back and try the regular menu.
January 12, 2015|You guys get it!|5|Dinner at Camilles is always an outstanding experience. From the valet who gets my car before I even give him the ticket, the host who is most welcoming, the wait staff who attends to every need and of course the chefs who prepare a delicious meal each and every time. Camilles is second to none and will continue to be a special place for my wife and me.
December 27, 2014|Another Great Meal at Camille's|5|I will grab a bite to eat just about anywhere, but when I really want to dine well in Providence, Camille's is hands-down the best choice. Creative dinner specials complement the traditional Italian menu beautifully, and the extensive wine list in turn complements the cuisine. Service doesn't miss a beat, from the Valet, to the Managers working the door, to the Servers and Bartenders (We like the bar on weeknights). Pretty sure they are one of the last hold-outs offering actual coat-check during the colder months, too. Thanks again Camille's!
December 24, 2014|Camille's|3|"The food was good but not excellent Not what I expected from ""Camille's"". Mashed potatoes? Lack of creativity for a holiday meal was very disappointing. Vegetable was asparagus spears- steamed since they were rather large- again lacking creativity. I could have made this meal at home in about 40 minutes. The calamari was wonderful, the salad was wilted. The ambiance was nice. However we (a pair) were seated at a four top facing a wall while there was so much nice decor to look at. Also our chairs were constantly kicked by wait staff walking past- very annoying. Seemed like amateur hour-- I thought Camille's was top notch??"
December 20, 2014|Camille's is the place for your event|5|We were greeted at the door and escorted to our table within minutes or arrival. The interior was decorated for Christmas in a very tasteful and elegant manner. The waiter was very attentive to our needs and professional. The wine selection was robust and we found a very nice Shiraz to go with the meal. The food was excellent, we had the Swordfish and the Veal Cutlet and a bottle of wine. Our entree's portions were so generous, we divided them in half first, just so we could save room for desert. The Chocolate cake was very rich and delicious. We plan on going there again for our next anniversary.
December 20, 2014|Best lasagna ever!|5|Amazing service and excellent food, it was my first time at Camille's but it won't be my last.
December 13, 2014|Wonderfully Updated, Food and Service Top Notch|5|"Having been a regular back in the 80's, Camille's was always my good too place with clients and family members for special occasions. The updates are very elegant, but not overstated. Expanded Bar area very nice providing live entertainment. Most important, the service was as great as I remember TOP NOTCH. Menu extensive with traditional Italian / Seafood selection as well as some very interesting additions. For those who have been drawn to the new ""trendy"" spots that part of the revised PVD night life, you are missing an opportunity to enjoy a true Federal Hill and Rhode Island gem if you do not visit Camille's."
December 13, 2014|Always Good|5|Been going to Camilles for years. Never disappointed. Service was prompt and very good on a very busy Saturday night. Not your average red sauce and meatball joint. Upscale inventive Italian that never fails to please the palate. Recommend very highly.
December 13, 2014|Everything was perfect.|5|Everything was perfect. The staff made you feel like you were the only one in the restaurant. Excellent!!
December 13, 2014|"The true meaning of ""fine dining"""|5|I took my fiance to Camille's this weekend for his birthday. It was our first visit to this restaurant and we could not have been more pleased with our experience! For starters, the place is GORGEOUS inside. Tastefully decorated, lighting is perfect, and the seating area is excellent for a romantic night out. Our waiter was excellent! He provided us with all of the specials and we ended up taking his suggestion for our wine, appetizer, and one meal choice! They were all as excellent as he described! He even came back to thank me for my generosity after leaving the gratuity. Overall, Camille's was by far one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had!
December 6, 2014|Great experience|5|I had such a great time. the service was uncomparable. The food was awesome from the appetizer to the dinner. I'm pretty satisfied. I was celebrating my 4th anniversary with my wife and they made it worth the night.. we got a free cake on the house. we really felt special in that restaurant. I would recommend camille's for any big events. It's the place to go!
December 6, 2014|Wonderful experience.|5|Camille's was a wonderful dining experience...we would go back in a hearbeat. I must be honest though......although I would return......I was disappointed in the dish I ordered...lamb chops. There were two (not very big) and they were very fatty. The italian wedding soup I had was out of this world.
December 5, 2014|consistently great|5|Everything was perfect. We ordered outside traditional italian meals (I had ahi tune and my wife had scallops), and they were both perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, with great presentation. On of the hallmarks of a great place is employee stability. Although we (sadly) only eat there about once a year, we recognized the same staff as last time.
December 3, 2014|Great Dinner in a Good Food Town|5|From a friendly welcome to a terrific server to delicious food to a charming setting, we loved everything about Camille's. We arrived with time pressure, told the headwaiter who promised to call a taxi for us...and did! Our waiter, told the same story, guided us to delicious food that wouldn't take forever to arrive...even asking the chef if we might have eggplant parmesan (not on the menu) - we did and it was delicious. The setting is charming, the seating comfortable and well spaced and, when the lighting was dim for our aging eyes, flashlights were produced to help us read the menu. I recommend Camille's...my only caveat...the portions are huge!
December 3, 2014|Camille's for a lovely lunch|5|Excellent service, never hurried us, nor over-asked us, pricate-felling table, very pretty decor and comfortable seats. Very good food quite reasonably priced. Best of all: when I left my credit card they called me immediately, having my phone number because of the Open Table reservation. When I drove back 10 minutes later to get it the valet was standing on the curb waiting to hand it to me (and refused my tip for this great service). I will go to Camille's again and recommend it to friends.
November 29, 2014|Great food, even better service|5|Four of us visited Providence for a weekend. We wanted to dine in the Federal Hill neighborhood and selected Camille's. When making our reservation my wife requested a quite table and the host followed through on that with no reminder. Our waiter was outstanding, a real professional. This is high end Italian food with thoughtful plating and wonderful flavors. Our waiter warned us that portions were ample and he was correct, but portion size was not in any way trying to mask poor quality. Exceptional wine list with wide range of prices. The four of us are already planning to return for a day trip and lunch.
November 28, 2014|Best Italian restaurant on the East Coast|5|From the time we were first greeted to the warm farewell, Camille's didn't miss a beat. Lamb was tender and perfect, flavors used in the Barramundi were phenomenal, Barbaresco was a perfect match for both. We'll be back soon.
November 28, 2014|What a gem!|5|Everything was wonderful--delicious food, excellent service and lovely atmosphere! Camille's tops any Italian restaurant in the North End section of Boston.
November 25, 2014|always amazing|5|We had a great time as usual. Service excellent, food amazing, love everything about Camille's. Great place to bring guests for a special occasion.
November 25, 2014|Top 5 Of The Best Restaurants I've Ever Been To|5|An incredible restaurant and special birthday evening - We shared calamari and caprese salad for appetizers. One of the best calamari's we've ever had. Two had the seafood casserole for dinner, which they are still talking about a few days later. I had the chicken parmesan which was also one of the best I've ever had. Great wine....great martini's. Our new favorite restaurant....we'll be back soon!
Dined on November 22, 2014|exceptonal food and service|5|my wife and I went to Camilles for our anniversary dinner and I cannot say enough. From food to service. The restaurant has a wonderful feel to it. very classy. Thanks, Dennis
November 22, 2014|Great service and amazing food!|5|Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. He was very friendly and we did not feel as though are time there was rushed. The food was amazing but we were sad that we had no room to try desert as we had consumed every last bit of our meals. I would recommend Camille's and I hope to return again son. Thank you for a great experience! Cheers!
November 22, 2014|excellent restaurant|5|Took my wife for her birthday. It was our first time here. Staff was great and the food was excellent. They even moved my reservation so we could have a table a little more private. We will definitely be back.
November 21, 2014|I had friends visiting from out of town ...|5|I had friends visiting from out of town & we wanted to go some place special for dinner. I chose the perfect restaurant. Everything was Fabulous! From the moment we were seated, which was right away & a half hour ahead of our reservation. Streight through to our delious dessert everything was perfect. The service was excellent and we never felt rushed. My friends were impressed and we will definitely be back.
November 18, 2014|11-18-14 dinner|4|Everyone in my party had a good meal. My veal marsala was not tender. My gnocchi were very good. We had a table of 5.
November 15, 2014|Great memories|5|Our experience was superb. Waitstaff was knowledgable and informative. Food - cannot say enough! Options and specials were fantastic and very well presented, not no mention delicious! Cookie tray for dessert was a great recommendation by our waiter. Will be back again soon!
November 14, 2014|Ryan was our waiter and he was great|5|the food was excellent i have been to listen to the group this was our first time eating there.
November 11, 2014|Quality and Service to the Max|5|Each time I visit Providence, I make it a priority to visit Camille's. Their famous lasagne and hearty cassoulet are my favorite dishes. Pair these dishes with a glass of their montepulciano, and you will leave extremely satisfied. The service is attentive and precise. There a lot of choices for Italian cuisine, and Camille's take it up a notch.
November 11, 2014|Extrodinary dining experience!|5|The restaurant had a wonderful menu with many selwctions for all foodies that was flexible, including many local italian favorites and a great and wide array of selections for all diners tastes. My Shrimp fra-diavlo over linguine was a knock out and my wifes ravioli was incredible. The service was personable and outstanding. The drinks rocked the house. The whole experience was awesome ans yes I will be back and highly recommend Camille's as one the premiere Italian restaurants in the area. Try it. You will love it, guaranteed.
November 8, 2014|great atmosphere-great live music|4|Went to Camille's while in town for a girls weekend with my daughter and best friend. Food was good. Didn't love the menu, but the service and atmosphere were great. After dinner we went to the bar and had our dessert and there was a great live band!! It was a great night!!
November 8, 2014|Romantic evening, amazing food|4|the salmon was the best I ever had. the tuna appetizer was great as well
November 8, 2014|My husband and I were in the area over t...|5|My husband and I were in the area over the weekend to visit our daughter who attends college in Providence. We are always looking for new restaurants to try. Without a doubt, Camille's was one of the finest and best restaurants we have eaten in to date. The food was outstanding, the service impeccable but more importantly we could engage in conversation with my daughter and her boyfriend where we didn't need to shout over one another. The ambiance was wonderful, nice and quiet, yet lively at the same time. Although there are many great restaurants in Providence yet to try, we will definitely be back.
November 7, 2014|Trip to little Italy|4|First time visit. Great atmosphere. I ordered the sea bass special, but it seemed like haddock. My husband was disappointed with the smelt appetizer feeling it was previously frozen. Other wise the rest of the food was delicious and the dessert of banana crepes was the best we had. Tony was an excellent server.
November 1, 2014|Simply The Best|5|The best restaurant this state has to offer. It has been number 1 in my book for years. Whenever someone ask me to recommend a place on Federal Hill, Camille's is always my first suggestion.
November 1, 2014|Amazing!|5|My family and I had one of the best meals of our lives here! A decorative curtain separated our table from the others on each side, so we had privacy. The service was perfect, very attentive but not intrusive. The food was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. A true dining experience!
October 31, 2014|Amazing|5|I wanted some good Italian food and that is exactly what I got! The waiter was impeccable. He was very nice and very attentive. The food was fresh and amazing! I had their homemade rigatoni with vodka sauce. My husband had their rigatoni with meatballs and house gravy. The food was delish!
October 29, 2014|Consistently Great|4|Classic Italian with traditional and new menu offerings. Great service and atmosphere.
October 25, 2014|Fine dining|5|We went to Camille's on a recommendation from someone I met on the airplane who works in the food industry who told me that he made certain to go to Camille's every time he was in Providence. We were not disappointed. The food was fabulous, the service was stellar, and the atmosphere was refined and classic. We too now plan to eat at Camille's every time we are in Providence.
October 25, 2014|brownparent|5|"We visited our daughter during parent's weekend. The traditional meals - lasagna, chicken marsala, chicken franchese - were excellent. Our daughter appreciated the dramatic step up from the ""V-Dub."" The service was equally outstanding. We then walked over to the river and enjoyed Waterfire. Camille's was part of our wonderful evening in Providence !"
October 25, 2014|It was a wonderful dinner with exception...|5|It was a wonderful dinner with exceptionally good food and wine. The service was fantastic from the time we arrived until we were wished a good night. I highly recommend Camille's.
October 22, 2014|Night Out|4|Took a client out to Camille's after an all day meeting in downtown Providence. The ambiance was different, but not necessarily in a negative way, it was just different. A little dark, a bit dated, butI suppose that is what to expect from one of the oldest Italian restaurants on Federal Hill. With that said, the food was great (large portions) and the service was excellent.
October 21, 2014|Our Providence Favorite|5|Our annual visit to Providence and Camille's was fun. Great food and service. Thanks to all.
October 21, 2014|Calamari at its finest|5|Went for lunch with a friend nd enjoyed the very best calamari I have ever had - ANYWHERE! Borth my guest and myself had soup (leak and pasta fagioli) and the calamari salad. Both were generous serving and the taste was outstanding. It was easy to converse with the noise level very low and the service was attentive but not the least bit intrusive. Can't wait to go back and try other offerings.
October 20, 2014|heavy on the damask|2|Lots of rich atmosphere, the food was just so-so. Service was good. Our table was surrounded on three sides by heavy drapes. Didn't love the effect.
October 18, 2014|Excellent Italian Chow|4|The food here is really good. The portions are large and fairly priced for the quality and preparation. Servers aim to please. We had a great evening here. Standouts included the calamari, crab cakes, cassoulet, gnocchi, desserts. OK wine list, a bit pricey. Overall a great Italian place and one of Providence's best dining spots. Deserving of 4.5 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
October 11, 2014|May Not Be A Better Meal!!!|5|My wife and I went here for our 11th Wedding Anniversary and Camille's did not disappoint. Everyone was very friendly from the moment we dropped off our car at the valet, to the moment we picked it up. The ambiance was very nice, but the best part of the dining experience was the food that was served. This was top notch. I can't remember the last time I had a meal this good, not to mention the size of the portions. Mama Mia!!! I would highly recommend Camille's for anyone that is looking for a great meal and relaxing evening!!
October 10, 2014|I love Camille's.|5|Camille's is one of my favorite restaurants. I love everything about it. My only complaint this time is that I felt a little rushed during dessert. The food, service and atmosphere are excellent.
October 10, 2014|Reliable and surprising|5|The regular menu always reliably delivers great food and the specials are always creative
October 10, 2014|Awesome time thanks for making our anniv...|5|Awesome time thanks for making our anniversary special
October 4, 2014|Perfect as usual...|4|I have no complaints, Everything is as good as can be from the valets to service, portions and overall quality. One of the most quiet restaurants, a lot of fabric in the decor absorbs noise. I've been going to Camille's for years, I keep it in my Providence fine ding rotation. The food is outstanding, needed a doggy bag.
October 4, 2014|Lovely Dinner|5|Service, food and ambiance were excellent. Our party of 6 enjoyed a wonderful evening at Camille's. Two of our members came later than expected due to rain and inability to take a taxi. The staff could not have been nicer and more understanding about it. Special thanks to our waiter, Steve, who was very professional yet fun. We enjoyed meeting Mike, the general manager. This was our first time at Camile's, but won't be our last. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
October 3, 2014|Excellent|5|Atmosphere was relaxed. Service was some of the best we've ever had. Classic Italian dishes, Food was excellent!!! Absolute must if visiting Providence.
October 2, 2014|Excellent Food|5|The food was fantastic, although it seemed like we were the only people in the restaurant. Could be due to the fact it was Thu. and our reservation was for 5:30. Delicious food, elegant atmosphere and top notch service!
September 27, 2014|Outstanding on every level|5|I had a foodie friend in from New Jersey where there are many excellent restaurants - especially in the rhelm of Italian food. I wanted her to have the best RI food experience possible for the brief time she was here. Camille's did not disappoint and lived up to my hype! From our appetizer ( stuffed squash flowers ) through dessert ( Italian cookies ) the entire evening was perfect! The service could not have been improved. Mike and his staff provided a WOW evening. Thank you again for another wonderful restaurant experience. PS I never take home leftovers except from Camille's. They are anticipated as much as when originally served!
September 26, 2014|My Favorite On The Hill|5|The service was exquisite (except when the waiter forgot my wine) and the food was delicious. My only complaint was the mark-up on a bottle of wine. I fully understand that restaurants make their money on alcohol. I don't even mind spending a lot of money on a bottle of good wine. However, I do mind paying $55.00 for a bottle of wine that I can get for $14.99 in a liquor store. I am assuming that means the restaurant is paying no more than $10.00 for the bottle. That is a 550% markup. I would certainly go to Camille's more often if this were not the case. It's a little insulting.
September 25, 2014|10 year anniversary dinner|5|I had a gc for Camille's and decided to use it to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We used the valet. We were early, but had reservations. We sat at the bar to have a cocktail until it was time to be seated. The host brought us to our table towards the back, a table slightly enclosed by curtains. The host pulled out my chair and placed a napkin on my lap. My husband and I ordered calamari, which was fabulous. If you are sharing it, they will separate it on plates for you. My husband ordered veal and pasta and had enough to bring home for lunch that next day. I ordered the seared sea scallops with spinach. Both meals were delicious! They gave us a piece of cake with a candle for our anniversary!
September 24, 2014|Highly recommended|5|Food and service were top class. Damon our waiter didn't rush us at all and had no problem giving us recommendations. Highly recommended, our meal could not have tasted better and the wines were excellent. Will return again
September 24, 2014|Truly Fine Dining|5|Thanks to the wonderful staff at Camilles. I have been in town for a couple of days and was completely WOWED !! by the food and service at this tremendous establishment. No wonder you have been around for 100 years ! My meal was outstanding and my dinner guests have not stopped raving about our experience. (thanks for helping me close a big business deal) You truly impressed.
September 24, 2014|Best Restaurant in RI|5|Complimentary valet service (leave at least a $5, dont be cheap) welcomes you to the best food I've had in RI, presented by very knowledgeable and professional servers. We let our waiter choose starters and he did not disappoint! Everyone got their own plate with a little taste of all the appetizers. Wine list was same size as dinner menu...5 leather-bound pages. Our server was very comfortable with the wine list, but when George the manager came by he was able to tell us a little about almost every bottle on the list. Saw the 2014 wine spectator award hanging on the way out. We all ordered specials for entrées and a house-made ricotta cheesecake with espressos to finish. I have nothing but great things to say about the evening.
September 18, 2014|Very dissapointed|2|Haven't been for 15 years. This place has really gone downhill. Ambience is still old school but it's tired. My lady ordered a dirty martini and had to send back. Calamari was excellent. My special, the veal chop was small and way overcooked. Her veal Marsala was ok and they brought her the wrong pasta and never asked me what kind I wanted. Gravy was sauce. No taste. To much competition to ever try again. Pretty much empty on a Thursday night.
Dined on September 13, 2014|Awesome food and plenty of it!!|5|"This is a stellar restaurant with a beautiful decor. Lighting is pretty low, great for romantic dinners. The food is top notch, better IMO than the ""#1 rated"" italian restaurant on tripadvisor for Providence."
September 12, 2014|Enjoyable experience|5|The food was outstanding. Hard to choose from such a large menu but in our group of 4, everyone loved their choice! Service was top notch and it was quite a lovely appointed space which elevated the dining experience. We went into the bar afterwards to enjoy the music being provided from a live band. We would definitely go back again soon and highly recommend it as an enjoyable night.
September 11, 2014|CAMILLE'S|4|Camille's would make the late Camille proud. Took girl friends here when i was at Brown '53. Miss the Clams Posillipo although our fine waiter, London, said they served a similar dish (little necks, olive oil and garlic, perhaps a splash of Grecco de tufo was the original dish over al dente spaghetti!). The Baratta (sp?) was simply fab! Great evening.
September 11, 2014|Amazing service|5|Great restaurant, amazing food. Very romantic! Including a complimentary desert for celebrating our anniversary there.
September 10, 2014|Perfect for a Special Occasion|5|Impeccable service, beautiful ambience, fresh food prepared exquisitely. top shelf all the way.
September 9, 2014|Some of the best food I've ever had in m...|5|Some of the best food I've ever had in my life. Osso Bucco absolutely knocked my socks off.
September 9, 2014|Great food, exceptional service|5|Took daughter to Camille's for her birthday. Couldn't have been better.
September 6, 2014|diner|5|Camille's was exceptional!!! This was our first time visiting Camille's. We frequent other Federal Hill establishments frequently. Camille's is by far the best!!! The food was amazing, but more importantly, the service sold us!!! David was our waiter. He was exceptional. Attentive, kind, but not over-bearing. We never felt rushed and he was a pleasure to work with. Can't say enough good things our David and the service. Will definitely be back. Thanks for making my husband's birthday a great night out.
September 6, 2014|Just Right|5|Another wonderful experience at Camille's, from the bartender to the wait staff everyone is super attentive and wonderful. Food was fabulous, the real hidden gem is Pork Chops with vinegar peppers. Night for 4 to celebrate an anniversary with my wife, son and his girlfriend, everyone was completely satisfied and full when we left. You can't go wrong with Camille's!!!!
September 6, 2014|F$&/ing Outstanding|5|Best Calamari (sp) we have ever had and we always order this appitezer. Waiter was outstanding, with one exception. However it really didn't impact us. All the food was outstanding and it is so much cheaper than Boston 's Northend. Will go back and suggest it to other friends.
September 2, 2014|Another Good Experience|5|Another outstanding meal at Camille's. Meet out-of-town old friends here almost every summer and have never been disappointed. Warm, friendly staff who were very attentive to our needs without smothering us in service. Presentation outstanding and food was delicious, to say the least.
August 29, 2014|Food good but not great|3|To much time passes between courses to maintain dinner continuity. Dinner for 2 took about 2 hours. Food was only good and the services was disjointed and seemed slow.
August 29, 2014|Great experience|4|Great service and food. Also extensive wine list. Everytime we visit Rhode Island Camille's is our first stop for dining.
August 28, 2014|Old world charm, creative menu|4|Choosing from among several great dishes was the hardest part of the experience. Great service, ambience, and background smooth jazz music were also pluses that added to the experience. The décor was a bit old school, but it was still pleasant.
August 23, 2014|Love Camille's|4|The food was fantastic as it always is, the service was exceptional once again. We love Camille's and go as often as we can because the food as I said, is just outstanding.
August 20, 2014|Great Experience|5|I have been to Camille's more times then I can count. It never disappoints.
August 19, 2014|Excellent Food and Service|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. Atmosphere, food and service is excellent. We look forward to our return.
August 16, 2014|Perfect!|5|We have been to Camille's several times and we have never been disappointed!!
August 16, 2014|Top notch|5|The exquisite food is complimented by a relaxed, classy environment and spectacular service
August 16, 2014|first visit|4|great place been there on the hill forever so i thought it would be stuffy but its a vibrant beautiful well managed and exciting restaurant. i loved the food we both had fish specials that were cooked perfectly. best fish i ever had. great place we will be going back
August 16, 2014|Outstanding Restaurant|5|We (12 of us) celebrated my in-laws' 50th wedding anniversary at Camille's. It was a perfect evening. The drinks, appetizers, and entrees were delicious. My lemon drop martini was so smooth. We all loved the calamari that was made of huge, lightly breaded rings. I ordered the chicken franchise, which was yummy. I tried my sister-in-law's filet mignon and it melted in my mouth. Our server, London, provided excellent service. He was so friendly and efficient. We were surrounded by elegant ambience as we sat comfortably at our roomy table. We will be sure to visit again.
August 16, 2014|Missed on the special|3|The special was haddock on spinach with a small tempura style lobster tail on top. Presentation was excellent. The fish was a nice size but bone-dry. And the tail had a much to heavy coating. Service and ambiance was spectacular.
August 11, 2014|Exceptional|5|A great find for us when passing through Providence. Recommended to us by other Restaurant owner as place to go.
August 9, 2014|Excellent Find|5|Cannot say enough good things about Camille's. This restaurant does everything right. Service, food and ambiance all exceptional. This is a can't miss.
August 9, 2014|Simply The Best|5|"Our favorite restaurant in Providence. Camille's never disappoints, whether you are in on a quiet weeknight or a line-at-the-door Saturday; food and service are the best in town. Any time we are looking to ""wow"" anyone, this is the spot."
August 9, 2014|Italian Culinary Delight|5|Great Italian food served in wonderful atmosphere in the heart of Providence's Federal Hill area. Original food creations are served along with more traditional choices. Helpful, attentive wait staff seal the deal so you'll want to return to dine at Camille's again and again.
August 7, 2014|delicious!|5|The food was absolutely wonderful, and the specials in addition to the regular menu gave you plenty to choose from. I would definitely go back on our next visit!
August 2, 2014|Delicious Food, Beautiful Setting!|5|My visit time at Camille's in Providence and it did not disappoint! The restaurant is located in a gorgeous old mansion on the hill off Atwell. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. We ordered the watercress beet salad, eggplant pasta and the Osso Buco, all of which were amazing. They serve big portions here so order accordingly....great for sharing! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!
August 2, 2014|CAN  IT  POSSIBLY  GET  ANY  BETTER|5|EXCELLENT in all respects! From the initial greeting, to seating, to location of our table, the wait staff's introduction and his knowledge of the menu and wine list. Really a superb all-around experience!
August 2, 2014|It was my in-laws 67th Wedding Anniversa...|4|It was my in-laws 67th Wedding Anniversary, they are both 86 --- so we booked an early dinner for them. It was booked for 5:30PM. We were a party of seven. The service was very good, but we thought we were a bit rushed through the courses, our only thought was that perhaps with the early booking, they would want this table for another 'sitting'. When we were leaving around 7:30PM, the crowd was just coming in. Still a great restaurant.
August 2, 2014|A lovely evening|5|We had a great meal with very fine service. The decor was very nicely upgraded since the last time we were there, although it was very dark at first until your eyes adjusted to the low light. We will most certainly return here
July 31, 2014|Consistently good food and service|5|Worth the two hour ride from western Mass. Outstanding in every respect
July 29, 2014|Best in town|5|Time after time Camille's shows its pedigree. Best service in town, cuisine you can count on whether you want old-school Italian or trendy-creative, and one of the few wine lists in Providence that I consider impressive. Don't ever take those shrimp off the menu!!
July 26, 2014|Nice to be back|5|The dining experience this weekend at Camille's Restatrant was exceptional. From service and Atmosphere at the bar to the Valet servers, the entire experience was satisfing. A special mention to our server Lincoln who provided outstanding service and professionalism to our party. My husband was happy with the choice to entertain a buisness partner at Camille's and plans to utilize this option in the future.
July 25, 2014|Excellent !!!|5|Excellent as usual. Great service and great food. Always a great dinning experience at Camille's.
July 21, 2014|Good place for a business meeting|5|Met a high level client there - we had a group of 6 in all. Great food, professional staff and good atmosphere. We were able to focus on getting down to business and enjoyed the time very much.
July 19, 2014|First visit, not last|5|We had dinner there on a Saturday night and arrived early for a 7:00 reservation. We were greeted and promptly seated at a quiet table. The wine list was extensive and the menu, supplemented by many specials, offered excellent choices. ALL appetizers and entrees were delicious. Service was attentive, though the wait between appetizer and entrée did seem a bit long. The restaurant even presented my daughter and her husband with a special dessert to help celebrate their first anniversary. All in all, a terrific experience and we will be back.
July 19, 2014|Best Restaurant Ever|5|While visiting my husband in RI- he was recommended this restaurant. This was the best service and food I've ever had!!! Great spot to get quiet and cozy with your significant other!
July 18, 2014|From the food to the service to the ambi...|5|From the food to the service to the ambiance, everything was very good. I would have no hesitation about returning to this restaurant.
July 17, 2014|Best meal I've eaten in years|5|I eat in restaurants all over North America. This was by far the best meal I've had in the last two years
Dined on July 16, 2014|FANTASTIC|5|I would recommend this restaurant to anyone! The atmosphere was beautiful, elegant and welcoming; the food was fantastic; the service was top notch!
July 15, 2014|The place to go in Providence|5|"My wife and I can't stop raving about our meal. From the time we drove up to the front door, to the time we left, we were made to feel so special. Inside is absolutely beautiful, but when we were asked if we wanted to dine in or ""alfresco"" we were surprised. They have the best little courtyard outside. What a difference from the noisy plaza with everyone staring at you. The food and service were amazing. The staff didn't miss a beat. As a matter of fact we made reservations already again for Saturday night."
July 15, 2014|Special occasion safe bet|5|"Camille's has been our favorite for several years now. Quality and service are never in question, wine list deserves every award it carries. Squash flower appetizer is the best in town, and on this particular visit there was a veal porterhouse I will be going back for. Crazy busy for a Tuesday night (Providence Restaurant Week apparently) but the staff didn't miss a beat. We were made to feel special for every minute of our evening, from the gracious way we were greeted to the sincere ""thank you"" on the way out, and everywhere in between. Thanks Camille's!"
July 14, 2014|Fantastic|5|It was my parents 40th anniversary. They had the flowers on the table that I had ordered. The waitstaff knew it was their anniversary and said happy anniversary to them. Everyone was very friendly and the food was fantastic!
July 12, 2014|Restaurant Week Visit|2|I invited another couple to dinner to experience restaurant week and we chose Camille's. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that Camille's Restaurant Week specials were not available on Saturday and Sunday? Why participate in Restaurant Week if you can't participate for the entire 13 days????
July 11, 2014|Improperly cooked food/bad service|1|We were made to wait 30 minutes at the bar even though seating was available outdoors and we had a reservation. Poor service, pork and chicken raw when served, drink orders incorrect, poorly mixed when recieved. Would not recommend.
July 11, 2014|Tooo slooooowww|3|My wife and I dined here on a Friday night. We sat outside and ordered oysters for an appetizer and lasagna for our main course. The oysters were fantastic so we ended up ordering another 1/2 dozen. We waited and waited and after 20 minutes they brought out the second order of oysters. Then we waited another 20 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Way too long a wait as far as we were concerned. But overall the food was good and we weren't in a hurry.
July 10, 2014|Disappointed|3|Had heard and read wonderful things about Camille's, but the food did not live up to the hype. Mediocre at best. It was restaurant week in Providence and only ordered off the special menu because the waiter said these were the top meals. Not great. Even the cannoli for dessert was tasteless. Very disappointed
July 9, 2014|Impeccable Service and Food|5|Some restaurants just know how to make their guests feel special when they walk in the door and Camille's is one of them. The seafood was cooked to perfection. Camille's has been around for decades and it shows, they have it down to a science.
July 8, 2014|Excellent~!|5|"Our first time dining at Camille's and it was a wonderful experience. The food was fabulous and the staff/service exquisite. Our waiter, Scott G., was very attentive, personable, and never missed a beat; timing was perfect and his recommendations-great . We will definitely return. Thank you for an all-around delish experience! We highly recommend Camille's~ The décor could use a bit of freshening up. Pine cones and evergreens made it feel a bit more ""winterish"" on a lovely summer evening."
July 7, 2014|Restaurant Week Visit|4|Enjoyed are dining experience at Camille's restaurant. The food and service was superb!
July 5, 2014|Overall the service was fantastic! Wait ...|4|Overall the service was fantastic! Wait staff very attentive for our large party. Wine selection amazing. Fish fresh; steak melted in your mouth; vealchop scrumptious. The zucchini flowers were good but too much fried dough. Calamari absolutely delicious! Risotto balls were ok but needed a little more seasoning. Loved having valet parking
June 28, 2014|The best fine dining in Providence|5|Flavorful food, excellent service, warm and romantic atmosphere. We will definitely return. The live music is a plus!
June 28, 2014|A+ experience|5|Everything was terrific- the service, the food, the ambience and the wine. We also appreciated the complimentary valet parking.
June 28, 2014|The best on Federal Hill|5|I've been to Camille's several times and have always been very happy with the food and service. The prices for this type of classy restaurant are not too high either.
June 28, 2014|Quality Food & Outstanding Service|5|I go out to eat allot. 12-15 times / month. I took my my date here, before going out and experiencing the Providence night life scene. It had been recommended by an little Italian guy from South of Boston who said - tell them Tony sent you. Our waiter - Scott was attentive to our needs before we became aware of them. - Decanted 2 bottles of red in two different decanters and two sets of wine glasses. The service from the Valet to the Maitre D, to the Waiter and back to the Valet was impressive and moved along with the ease of a restaurant enjoying their 100th anniversary. This is old world dining with an updated menu and a wine list bordering on ridiculous for quality. The list has a great pick in every price point. Understated Elegance.
June 28, 2014|Great restaurant, have always enjoyed th...|3|Great restaurant, have always enjoyed the food but this time my fish was undercooked. They took it back and had cooked a little more but still not cooked enough. A little disappointed in how it was handled, just an apology. I feel with the prices you pay there for the meal they really should've given something complimentary. The overall meal would have been fantastic.
June 28, 2014|Spumoni to die for! (and more!)|5|So thrilled to have experienced the food and service at Camille's on Saturday evening, June 28. The Maître D greeted us with genuine warmth and enthusiasm, setting the stage for a fabulous experience. The menu had tasty options including more moderately priced Pasta to more expensive choices- all delicious! Rissoto was perfections, but everything was flavorful and abundant (way too much for any of us to finish on our own!) The best part of the meal was the Spumoni- a decadent tower of delicate tastes of homemade ice creams, with chocolate, strawberry, and pistachio topped with fresh sweetened whipped cream and amazing chopped nuggets of candied fruit! One order for three people, and while we thought we'd burst, it was too good to leave!
June 28, 2014|Great Food !|5|A little on the upscale side of pricey, but worth the dining experience ! I would recommend Camille's.
June 24, 2014|Delicious food but service was very slow...|4|Delicious food but service was very slow. Two hours for lunch is way too long.
June 21, 2014|Always great food !!!|4|My wife and I diner here about once a month . The food is always incredible, but for Saturday night the service was awful . The waiter never introduced himself, never told us about the specials , never asked if it was a special night , never stopped looking down my wife's shirt . Never checked on us , never asked if he could get us a second drink, even when he was clearing your glasses away. I think I heard one of the other waiter call him London, so I don't know if that's his name or a nickname. So my advice is if you go here , stay clear of London !! He will just bring your night down !! Sorry Camille's to write a bad review about your staff, but people should know. Still one of the top 5 restaurants in Providence !!
June 14, 2014|Great A+|5|great restaurant. Really good ambiance, comfortable decor and really good service.
June 14, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|In a word, superb. Great atmosphere, wonderful, polished but friendly service and outstanding food. Go to Providence so you can dine here.
June 14, 2014|Excellent|5|Right from the start, the vale men were fantastic! Wait staff were excellent, food fantastic!! I will absolutely be back!! Wonderful evening!
June 14, 2014|Outstanding|5|The food was absolutely wonderful and the service was the best I have ever experienced at any restaurant. Everything from the convenient valet staff to the host to the wait staff was perfect! Can't wait to go again.
June 14, 2014|Terrific food, a little pricey|5|The restaurant was terrific. Excellent service that started right when we sat down. The food was also great! Everything was delicious, from the salads, to the appetizers and entrees. It is a little pricey, and I was surprised that there were a couple substitutions that they would not do because of price concerns.
June 12, 2014|Consistently good|5|Made it a point to return to Camille's because of previously good experience. Food I'd consistently good . Portions are large enough for sharing or next days lunch. Staff is attentive and accommodating. Dinning room decor is dark.
June 11, 2014|I loved the romantic feel of this place ...|5|I loved the romantic feel of this place especially because I celebrated my 64th birthday. I will definitely return many times over. Damion, our server, was well-timed, friendly, and very knowledgeable of the menu. The made to order pasta fagioli was outstanding. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the oysters for an appetizer and the lasagna for the main dish. The portions were enough to still take home left overs. The experience could not have been any better. Thank you for making my day special.
June 5, 2014|Outstanding, Service Food and Decor|5|The Valet, Manager, and Wait staff made my wife and I feel like we were the most important guest in the world. Then the cocktails were fantastic as we enjoyed our Shrimp Santiago appertizer. The dinner was superb, offering good sized portions so I cannot rate the deserts until my next visit...
May 31, 2014|Outstanding Restaurant!|5|This restaurant is one of the gems of Federal Hill. From the romantic atmosphere to the outstanding service to the mouth watering food. You will not be disappointed here.
May 31, 2014|Good was great, service also great. Seat...|4|Good was great, service also great. Seating for two too close to each other, felt like conversation was not contained to our table. More space between tables would help
May 28, 2014|Disappointing|2|We went to Camille's a few years back and remember it being very good. Perhaps there is new management or a new chef, but this time we were quite disappointed. The appetizers were not very good (stuffed mushrooms were a soggy blob of breading, stuffed zucchini blossoms were just fried dough). The entrees (swordfish, veal, scallops) were better, though the portions were so huge we felt there was a focus on quantity and not quality. There was little imagination -- all the entrees just came with basic mashed potatoes and asparagus. We ended up taking so much food home, we had enough for two more meals each. Really, there should be a focus on smaller, more imaginative, and much higher quality dishes vs what is being served today.
May 24, 2014|Great pick|5|We picked this place to celebrate our anniversary after reading the reviews. It exceeded our expectations. The waiter we had was great and helped us with our selections. He also timed each item we ordered perfectly. We had plenty of time to enjoy the food and have great converstions without feeling pushed. The food was prepared perfectly. The lobster casserole melted in my mouth.
May 24, 2014|Best in RI|5|I've said it before and I'll say it again... this is the best restaurant in the state of RI, by far!! My wife and I have dined in many gourmet and five star restaurants both in the US and abroad. I can honestly say that Camille's is consistently on the top of our list. The service is always outstanding and the food is always perfect. Although we don't live close anymore, we won't hesitate to make the 40 minute drive to Camille's. Camille's sets the benchmark of what fine dining should be... Keep up the great work!
May 24, 2014|Classic Dining|5|A two hour Classic Dining Adventure...sophisticated, flawless, engaging, memorable. To appreciate a perfect 10 make your reservation at Camille's Restaurant.
May 23, 2014|Thank you!|5|This was my family's first visit, it was for my wife's birthday. The food was excellent, great portions and the wine was very good. The service was top notch from the moment we walked it. The valet even chased me into the restaurant because he noticed I had left my phone in the console. Great restaurant!!!!!!!!!!
May 23, 2014|night out|4|We often have last minute choice for dinner. The price must match the food and service. I don't mind spending a lot if we are treated like royalty and the service and food is above average to excellent! The appetizer was not the best temp. My wine glass should never be empty. I would prefer to be asked if I would like another wine before the glass is empty. The dining area was nice! I like the ability to have a conversation without being loud or do close to other diners that you can't hear. We will go again..!!
May 23, 2014|contemporary but classic|5|I loved the decor. the service was very easygoing but sophisticated. the food was fabulous. I loved the seating so comfortable and romantic.
May 19, 2014|Over all very good...food was excellent,...|4|"Over all very good...food was excellent, our server was excellent...especially how well he handled my ""has to change the entire menu to order"" husband. He took him in stride and made him very happy...which is not easy to do. So I would recomend this restaurant to anyone."
May 17, 2014|Overpriced wine|3|The waiter offered a non-acidic wine to my friend without mentioning the price. She did not like it told me that it was not very good and left more than half of it. When the bill came she was horrified: it was $22 a glass. That is too bad because the food was good and we had a pleasant evening. The wine ruined everything. Next time we will either chose from the wine menu or we will stick to the house wine. Their white house wine was good.
Dined on May 17, 2014|Amazing!!!|5|I never write reviews for restaurants, but my experience at Camille's was so excellent and notable that I felt I needed to write something. This restaurant is truly the gem of Federal Hill. The food was absolutely fresh, unique, and basically tastes like your grandmother's cooking yet still remains at the same time very up-scale. The menu special items were eclectic and extremely original; it was hard to decide what to pick! The service was equally as good as the food. Our main waiter was extremely polite, professional, and performed his job with ease and elegance. This was one of the best meals and service I have ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant.
May 16, 2014|Make an evening of it. |4|Wonderful meal- well-paced, superb service. Filet mignon special was great, as were the calamari appetizer. We plan to return soon!
May 12, 2014|Always a favorite|5|This is one of our favorite restaurants. From the time you enter, until you leave, you are treated first class. It was our anniversary, and the food was terrific. The calimari was fabulous, as was my meal of scallops and crab legs. Ended up bringing half of it home. For a first class restaurant, the portions they give are amazing. This place never disappoints, and look forward to going back soon.
May 11, 2014|Always a great meal|4|Camille's is my go to place for a special occasion and on Mothers' Day they did not fail. We were seated exactly on time, the staff excellent, and the food superb. It remains one of my favorites.
May 11, 2014|Camille's, Providence, RI|5|Everything about Camille's was outstanding starting with the valet and all the way through the meal. The menu offers a number of dishes and if they are all like the ones we enjoyed, then there will be many trips back to Camille's to try them all. The entire staff from the host who greeted us, to the server and the busboy; all were professional, friendly and courteous. The server was very knowledgeable about the dishes and helped us decide, since it was our first visit to Camille's. The recommendations exceeded our expectations. Food was perfectly prepared and served with 5-star attention. There wasn't any part of our dinner that could have been improved. I highly recommend Camille's and make reservations.
May 11, 2014|Mom was treated like a Queen !!|5|Thank you to all the staff that helped make Mother's Day such a memorable experience. Most restaurants treat holiday guests like tourists. Camille's rolled out the red carpet. The food and service was amazing. What a nice gesture giving Mom a beautiful plant when she was leaving. My family can't thank you enough.
May 11, 2014|Always Great!|5|With Rhode Island's great restaurants Camille's Restaurant Tops Rhode Island's Best!
May 10, 2014|Recommendation was true|5|Ever get a recommendation that doesn't quite live up to expectations? We received a recommendation to try Camille's after attending a show at the PPAC. We were a little skeptical about the great recommendation we received but it decided to try it, The recommendation was right on!! Great service, outstanding food and excellent ambiance. Its not inexpensive to dine here but its well worth it for a special occasion. Definitely will be back.
May 9, 2014|Outstanding Experience|5|Camille's is always an outstanding experience and our dining on Friday night was no exception. Both of the hosts and managers were so friendly and helpful, and the wait staff went above and beyond. And on top of that, the food was delicious!
May 9, 2014|Outstanding presentation.  Our meals wer...|5|Outstanding presentation. Our meals were as delicious as they were beautiful. Perhaps the best fried calamari we've ever had. Fantastic wine list.
May 7, 2014|One the the best Italian places |5|Federal hill is still a great place to go as long as you stop by Camille's!
May 2, 2014|Wonderful place|5|My friend and I had a wonderful time at Camille's. From the moment we arrived, we had exceptional and friendly service from our Bartender and server who went out of their way to make it an enjoyable and memorable night. Excellent staff, delicious food and great atmosphere! Love Camille's and highly recommended.
April 29, 2014|Comfortably elegant ...|5|Spectacular menu, excellent service, and an ambience that is sophisticated and elegant without feeling stuffy. Top notch in every area!
April 26, 2014|Camille's is the deal.|5|Visited Providence RI and stopped here for a Saturday night dinner- Everything about the restaurant was excellent- food- atmosphere and most of all the wait staff- David, our waiter, was a true professional. It was my birthday and they brought out a nice desert and candle- with NO SINGING- that was really appreciated too.
April 22, 2014|It is no wonder that Camille's is about ...|5|It is no wonder that Camille's is about to celebrate its centenial. It is the complete package: delicious food (and generous portions), outstanding service in a very comfortable and well-appointed space.
April 20, 2014|Easter Sunday |5|Our family has never eaten out on a holiday. Most restaurants are rushing you out the door for the next guests. Camille's was quiet, relaxed and the service was impeccable. We felt like special guests. The gift of the Easter lily for each woman at the table was a perfect touch. The food was delicious and abundant. We will definitely go back for a holiday dinner or special occasion.
April 20, 2014|Elegant Dining|5|Great food and service for a special Easter dinner. The menu was very diverse and provided something for everyone. Our waiter was very attentive and and very knowledgeable about the menu and wines.
April 19, 2014|Wonderful evening|5|Celebrated a special birthday for our first visit to Camille's. There will be many more visits to follow! Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable, pleasant. Dinner was fabulous. Shrimp Scampi and Zuppa Di Pesce were our selections for the evening. Both dishes were extremely well prepared. Along with the quality, there was most certainly, no problem with quantity. Entire staff at Camille's were right on point. We'll be back sooner than later.
April 19, 2014|Overall positive|2|The ambiance and overall atmosphere was fantastic, and the bar area and band were great. the wait service was unfortunately very slow-I asked several times for bottled water and never got it. Several people in our party waited too long to have their drinks replenished. Prices were fair
April 19, 2014|On a scale of 1 to 10 an 11!|5|First timers who will be back many times! There wasn't anything that wasn't outstanding, from the food, the service, the ambiance, to management. Already looking forward to our return trip.
April 17, 2014|Must Try|5|"We had a wonderful experience at Camille's. The crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms we the best I ever had. I tried the Barramundi fish special and it was very enjoyable. My husband had the scallop special and of course I had a taste, yummy. my daughters had the prime rib, always a crowd pleaser and the gnocchi, very pleasing but could have had a bit more flavor. The chocolate cake they brought out for my birthday was the ""icing on the cake"" to our who experience."
April 12, 2014|Old school service and hospitality|5|If you want to feel like a king or queen, this is the place to go. From the time you pull up to valet and walk through the front door into the richly decorated and classic interior of the restaurant, you will receive outstanding service. These people are professionals. And the food is outstanding. The calamari appetizer is unlike any other approach to the classic dish, not heavily fried or oily but light and exploding with flavors. We stuck with classic Italian entrees and a solid Italian wine and were not disappointed at all. We felt free to linger over the menu (we needed the time, because the low lighting makes them hard to read!) and were not rushed from our table when we wanted to just sit and enjoy the afterglow of a memorable meal.
April 12, 2014|Like it dark?|3|Highly recommended, close to the hotel, but dark inside. Even using a phone app flashlight to light up the menu didn't help. Drinks were great, apps were interesting, entrees were well prepared...but it was way too dark. Perhaps, it was just our seating, but I' d be hard pressed to return...
April 12, 2014|outstanding service, great food|5|We were a party of 5 women celebrating my birthday last weekend. Everything was wonderful from beginning to end. Outstanding service, food was perfect, and our guest with dietary issues was easily accommodated. Definitely a great place for fun special occasions!

We sat at the bar and had a few drinks before dinner and the bartenders made us feel like we were old friends. We had great conversations and felt at home. As for dinner, I've never been to a restaurant where I couldn't decide what i wanted to eat. The selection and variety of food choices were amazing. My husband was in the same boat, so we told our server what our choices were and had him pick our dishes. I got the seared sea scollaps and my husband got steak medallions over lobster risotto or rice (can't remember).

April 5, 2014|One of the 5 best in Providence|5|My wife always chooses Camille's for her birthday or mother's day dinner. I've been there a dozen times, it's always very good. Easily one of the 5 best restaurants in Providence.
April 4, 2014|Amazing service|5|As young diners, we tend to not be treated as well as the rest of customers in restaurants. However, at Camille's we were treated excellently and had the best service of any restaurant we have dined in. We enjoy trying new restaurants and will definitely return to Camille's In the future. The food was outstanding and the waiter did a phenomenal job with helping us pick out a wine and offer suggestions. Highly recommend this place for date nights, special occasions, or just when you want to treat yourself to a fantastic night.
March 29, 2014|Staff|5|The Staff at Camille's was amazing! Attentive and courteous! David, our waiter was very formal and gallant! Nothing like having an amazing experience when out to dinner.
March 29, 2014|Great date night restaurant|5|Amazing service, polite and energetic staff, great food.
March 29, 2014|Never Disappointed|5|Camille's has become our favorite Federal Hill Restaurant. Camille's consistently has top notch service (valet parking, coat and hat check, impeccable table service), quiet and ample seating in a well decorated dining area that suits a business lunch or special occasion celebration for a couple. The pasta fagioli and the marinara sauce taste like my grandmother's recipes! We tried their crab cakes...as good as the best we've ever had and much better than 97% of most places. We are conscientiously working our way through their menu! Life is so good at times.
March 28, 2014|they need a nice big round|5|they need a nice big round table, I requested one for a group of 9 and they were unable to accommodate.
March 22, 2014|Just one little thing|4|Everything was excellent, just one little detail. We were pressed for time and had to wait a bit for our check. We actually wished we could have stayed longer but we had tickets to a play downtown.
March 22, 2014|Excellent food. Our server,|5|Excellent food. Our server, Steven, was outstanding and very knowledgeable. He made very good recommendations for our dinners. He was very attentive but not intrusive. The entire staff was cordial and helpful. It was a wonderful dining experience!!!!
March 21, 2014|Where to eat in Providence|5|I reserved a table for 8 for a first time getting together company dinner based on the reviews on Open Table. Camille,s turned out to be perfect, they are on Federal Hill, a nice neighborhood with many restaurants, they have a nice bar which we appreciated since we had to wait for one of our guests a 1/2 hour. The service and food were excellent especially the presentation. An added benefit for us was after dinner we got to dance and socialize at the bar which has a little dance floor and live music the night we were there.
March 21, 2014|Great date night|5|My wife and I loved our dinner at Camille's. So different from the chain restaurants; real ambiance and mood, great service. Just plain fun. And the bar is great, we danced the rest of the night away to the small band playing there. Awesome time!
March 20, 2014|Never disappoints|5|Great food and impeccable service. I dine here on every trip to Providence.
March 15, 2014|Always top notch|5|One of our favorite restaurants. Formal dining for a special night out in the dining room, a casual meal in the bar/lounge or outdoor patio drinks and apps in the summer. There is a perfect vidbe for every occasion and always top notch food and service.
March 15, 2014|More than expected|5|The place was much more than any 4 of us expected. It is definitely a do over. Oysters were fantastic, service top shelf and did not want for anything. Kudos to the staff of Camille,s, even the valet parking people.
Dined on March 10, 2014|Great service for a great setting|5|This might be the first restaurant we have gone to where we dressed up and didn't feel like we were the only ones. Our waiter (Damon) was friendly, funny, and very helpful when it came to making the night our anniversary simply perfect. The host (Mike) was very accommodating--he was able to shift our reservations without a problem, knew who I was when I walked in the door, and unobtrusively checked in to make sure we were having the best experience. The food and the wine were phenomenal. A definite favorite of ours. We will be going back there in the future for sure. --Jonathan and Andrea
March 7, 2014|Great family dining experience|5|From the minute we walked into Camille's we were impressed with the warm inviting ambiance The wait staff is very attentive and professional with great service. The portions are huge and delicious!!! They also presented a lovely Choc cake with whipped cream and a candle to our daughter without us asking ! Would definitely recommend Camille's for a delicious Italian dining experience in Providence Oh and valet service is excellent too !
March 6, 2014|Great repeat visit|4|I make it a point to dine here every time I visit Providence. This time I had a veal chop that was excellent. Service was spot on.
March 1, 2014|Great Evening|5|Everything about our experience from reservations, coat check, drinks and food was over the top outstanding..Come hungry and be prepared for a feast.
March 1, 2014|great experience|5|Haven't been there in awhile, great service from Maitre'd , waiter, bussers. Food was very flavorful, and options are still great. Dessert menu should have a couple warmer desserts for this time of year. Had creme brule which was pretty good. Mike Degnan keep up the great work with Camille's and your staff. Always a pleasure, will be back soon.
March 1, 2014|Great Food|5|Great meal,Impeccable service and fabulous desert! This was a perfect anniversary dinner!

February 26, 2014|Camille's Service WOWED us!|5|To go along with incredible, top-notch attention to our every wish, the food was to die for. Both the food and staff met our highest expectations...even to the extent that our waiter drive five of us back to our hotel. NOW THAT'S SERVICE. Camille's is certainly a place I will return to often and tell everyone about our incredible experience!
February 22, 2014|Will return|4|Large portions, good food and good service! Had the Italian wedding soup - enough for 3 people, papardelle with lots of bolognese, and the Nutella crepes - yum! GM went above and beyond and took me back to my hotel so I wouldn't have to wait on a taxi - now that's service!
February 22, 2014|Experience|5|My wife and I are so glad we chose Camille's restaurant. Quite frankly we had never been to Federal Hill before and took a gamble on picking a random restaurant. The choice couldn't have been better. From the valet parking crew to the welcome we recieved when we first walked in, to the amazing wait staff, to the great wine choices, and outstanding meal, this was worth every penny. Thank you for making our experience memorable!!

February 20, 2014|Classic!|5|We had a great meal, great bottle of wine and an expert waiter. Well done as always!
February 19, 2014|Fine dining at its best|5|A well decorated fine dining restaurant with being 100 years old. The items on the menu are fantastic because its diversified if your a meat, seafood or vegetarian eater. The staff are very nice and happy. Nice calm music playing in the background. Food was excellent.
February 18, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|From the elegant ambiance and great food to the valet cleaning all the snow off my car, it was a perfect experience.
February 15, 2014|A Great Night Out|5|Camille's is a high end Italian restaurant that delivers in every way! From the valet, matre'd, to waiter, we received impeccable yet friendly service. This was a special occasion for 4. We started with calimariand caprese (homemade mozarella topped with caviar) that were superb and split 4 ways away from the table and then individually served. Entrees included baked salmon, scallops, veal porterhouse, and veal parmesian. The presentation was spectacular as was the food. We finished with chocolate crepes covered in banana's Foster sauce...unbelievable!The wine list was outstanding. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. Camille's is a winner and worth every penny.
February 14, 2014|First of all, YOU DIDN'T have|1|First of all, YOU DIDN'T have the one thing that I go there for, which is the BEST Pork Chops around...and second, my girls' lobster scampi was bland and just plain NOT GOOD! This is the first time that we had a bad experience at Camille's, but it was bad enough for us to decide to go somewhere else. And for $160.00......NOT WITH IT!! There are a lot of great restaurants on the hill, and next time, we are going to venture elsewhere!
February 14, 2014|As alwayz, top notch .......|5|Service, food, and ambience was impeccable......3 years straight, Camille's has been my restaurant of choice for Valentines Day.
February 14, 2014|Valentine dinning disappointment|2|"Late night reservation with plenty of tables in main dinning area visible...shoved to the attic for their ""secret dinning room"", refused and seated at a very nice table in main dinning area...bus boy should be promoted to waiter, attentive and extremely efficient...waiter, was polite but not attentive...food was mediocre at best, very limited menu for a romantic dinner, not even a flower on the table...2nd time there and now convinced the 3rd time wouldn't be the charm. Recently (within the same week) dined at a nearby competitor, for the 1st time, and had a fabulous experience, new place to go..."
February 14, 2014|Very very good|5|Went for Valentines Day so was very busy. Table was on time, waiter was excellent but since 7:30'reservation wanted to keep things moving. Food was outstanding. Definitely would go back.
February 14, 2014|Fantastic|5|Food was delicious, and the service was extremely professional. The overall ambience of the restaurant was perfect for valentines day, the decor is beautiful as well. Would recommend to any couple or anyone in general.
February 8, 2014|Couldn't be more perfect|5|Found this restaurant while visiting Providence for the weekend on TripAdvisor. Couldn't have made a better choice. The ambiance was lovely, the service friendly and efficient and the food fantastic. We're from NJ, so trust me, we know a thing or two about Italian food and Italian restaurants in general. This place is a gem. Everything authentic and home made. Nothing over done or fussy. Bit on the pricey side, but absolutely worth it if a nice night out is what you desire. My only niggling complaint is that I thought the pacing was a little off. The time between our salads/appetizers and the main course was starting to feel long. And just as I was getting antsy, the food magically appeared though and it was well worth the wait.
February 8, 2014|Great classic Italian food|3|Great classic Italian food - stick with the classic food options. Wonderful service and attentive staff. However, be prepared to bring a flashlight to read your menu depending on where you are seated - the lighting can be quite dark!
February 7, 2014|Phenomenal|5|It was my first time dining at Camille's, one of the best dinners Ive ever had...the waitor was on point all night..Great experience!!!!!
February 1, 2014|Get your money worth|5|Everything was amazing!!!! Steak was a true 160oz with not a bit of fat and so tender you cut with butterknife.
January 25, 2014|Providence weekend|5|Excellent wine selections and mixed drinks. The salmon with Alaskan king crab n asparagus was to die for. Gnocchi 's were delicious and the cheesecake was delightful . One of the best on federal hill.
January 25, 2014|Another Gem on the Hill|5|I've been going to Camille's for years with family and friends and I've never been let down. The service is great, everyone is polite, and the food is great. I will be visiting for years to come.
January 25, 2014|Simply a Great Experience|5|In a city with many excellent restaurants, in an area known for it's great Italian food, Camille's stands out. When you walk in you see and feel a very upscale environment. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. When none of the wines were familiar to us (and there are many to choose from), he even found us a great one by listening to what we liked in a wine. The food was excellent from the Burrata Di Pugliese and Arancini Di Riso appetizers to the lasagna to the rib eye and through the dessert, they did not miss a beat. Not inexpensive but worth it.
January 25, 2014|Fabulous!|5|The food is always amazing, and the service is excellent.
January 18, 2014|Great night out|5|Everything about Camille's was fantastic. I hadn't been there in many years but found that it is still the best place on the Hill. Our waiter Joseph was great. Always there when needed and he took extra time with us making sure the wine was right. The food was incredible! Can't wait to go back!
January 18, 2014|The food was excellent, as|5|The food was excellent, as well as the service. A great place to celebrate any occasion.
January 17, 2014|Bon Appetit|4|Had reservations on a Friday night at 8 p.m. during restaurant week and were seated promptly as we arrived. Our waiter London was very accommodating as one of our party is gluten sensitive so he brought that to the attention of the kitchen. A wonderful extensive wine list gave us numerous choices. We felt they did a fantastic job with number of items offered on the restaurant week menu. Felt it was more extensive than most. The food was excellent as we choose from the sea scallops, pork chop, lobster ravioli and chicken parmigiana. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The restaurant is located on a small street so we took advantage of their valet parking which made it more convenient than searching for parking
January 17, 2014|Best All-Around - Federal Hill|5|Individually, other restaurants on Federal Hill may have better night life or possibly better food (though that's a close one too), but Camille's is the best all-around restaurant I've been to on the Hill. Ambiance, food, and service were all exceptional. Expect to spend between $100 and $150 for two people, but I'd say its a steal at any price.
January 17, 2014|First Timer|4|My experience at Camille's this past Friday night during restaurant week was amazing! It was a ladies night gathering and we ordered some of the best food. The drinks were good as well however the server messed up during the first round. He was very apologetic and because of his energy as well as the energy of the place, we didn't even mind. The ambiance, decor, food, drinks and service was exactly what we expected and more. I recommended this place to a few of my friends and family members. Another plus was the fact it was right on the federal hill strip. We walked the stripped and enjoyed Fridays night life. Thank You for an amazing experience!
January 16, 2014|Old World Class!!|5|I was very impressed with the staff, food, wine list and ambience. My customer loved it too!!
January 11, 2014|A Perfect Night|5|I wanted a special night as my wife and i celebrated her birthday. had never been to camille's, but found it through open table and it looked perfect...it didn't disappoint. from the moment we walked in to the moment we left, it was exceptional. food, wine, service, ambiance, decor...the list go on and on. when i made the reservation, i explained it was my wife's birthday so wanted a quiet table. got the perfect table, with just enough privacy. the waiter also delivered a birthday cake with a candle without any request from me, which was a nice touch. If you're looking to make your evening really special, you can't go wrong at camille's.
January 10, 2014|"Consistently outstanding
A"|5|Consistently outstanding A landmark on Federal Hill for a reason Outstanding appetizers and salads to go along with legendary entrees, all served with elegance and style
January 8, 2014|Unfailingly Delicious and Welcoming|5|I can't say enough about the food and service at Camille's. The menu finds a perfect balance between classic and new, the portions are hearty and they'll split your entrees table-side (Try a pasta entrée as a first course, then go for something meaty), and the servers are so attentive and pleasant. This reigns at the top of my list, especially on Federal Hill.
January 8, 2014|The Best in Federal Hill|5|My husband and I have been dining out in Providence's Federal Hill for many years and just discovered what we feel is now our favorite place - Camilles! The dining room was elegant and modern, the server, Joseph (from New Jersey) was the friendliest and and most informed of any we have had in past years. I had filet of sole with an eggplant appetizer that was to die for. Really. Please treat yourself to this impeccable and creative Italian restaurant. The chef is to be commended for his blend of just the right flavors.
January 4, 2014|always great...|5|Never a bad experience here.. you get what you pay for as they say.
January 4, 2014|Lovely night of food and dancing|4|My husband and I were there for his birthday, the food choices were plentiful. Many specials to choose from, however lots of crab and shrimp, which my husband is allergic to. He had beef tenderloin, it was tender and delicious. I had filet of yellow tail sole, also delicious. Many good choices on the wine list, some pricey but some reasonable. This is not a place I would bring my 3 year old, this is quiet fine dining. One disappointing appetizer, risotto balls, there was barely any meat inside, it still tasted good, just not what we were expecting. Yes we will return. There is a small lounge and live music, which was great!
Dined on January 3, 2014|Rhode Island Icon|5|Camille's is a RI Icon full of history spanning a hundred years. Anyone coming to RI for any event must experience the high scale, classic atmosphere of Camille's. RI has many 5 star restaurants but Camille's is in a league all its own....the food is incredible and the portions are huge. Be sure to order the crabcakes.....all fresh crab and hardly any cake. Ask for Bananas Foster for dessert. It is not on the menu but the chef (and the entire staff) is very accomodating. Be sure to stroll Federal Hill and catch a Waterfire event while you are here. I would not recommend summer attire or jeans and a t-shirt.
December 31, 2013|New Years Eve party.|4|My wife and I had reservations for dinner at 9:00pm on New Years Eve. The thought was to eat as late as possible so we could make it to midnight. Well we got there a half hour early and found a couple of seats at the bar. After a cocktail and great service from the bar tender Jeanine we decided to make this our home for the night. The food was perfect, drinks awesome (no short pours here) and the service was terrific. The band started at 9:30 and the dancing started. Needless to say...we made it to midnight and beyond. Met some great people, ate some great food. We had a great time.
December 31, 2013|elegant dining|5|My husband and I were there New Years Eve. It was so beautifully decorated . We were greeted with smiles and a welcome feeling from the valet to our wonderful waiter Joseph. Joseph is amazing with helping you choose food and wine. We love to have him as our server everytime we visit Camille's . The food was amazing....as always. Will be visiting there again soon.
December 31, 2013|new year's eve|5|was my first time returning to Camille's over 10 years...what a beautiful place. The wait staff (Damon) excellent and the food was superb. even though they were busy on New Year's Eve, the attention given to every table was outstanding. the food excellent!! Great job Can't wait to go back.
December 31, 2013|Great spot|4|"I have been to Camille's before and was just as pleased this time. I went in New Year's Eve and while I understand the need for a limited menu, I would have liked a ""just pasta"" dish. I love the gnocchi there and really wanted that but the filet was delicious. The potatoes were on the cool side but I wasn't going to hold up the meal over a potato. The crab cake was excellent!!!"
December 28, 2013|Great Dining Experience!|5|We went on a Saturday night. We were seated right away with a resevation. We've been to Camille's twice, and both times the food and service were perfect. No complaints at all.
December 27, 2013|Fabulous Food and Service|5|This was a great dining experience with terrific food, service and entertainment
December 27, 2013|FABULOUS!!!!!|5|I went there for dinner with my boyfriend before seeing Wicked at PPAC. The food was fantastic and the service was so good we gave our server a 30% tip! Love love love it there. It was my 3rd time going to Camille's, but my boyfriend's first time and he was blown away. Best restaurant on Federal Hill that I have been to. I would highly recommend Camille's to anyone.
December 24, 2013|wonderful Christmas Eve dinner|5|Thoroughly enjoyed our Christmas Eve dinner at Camille's. They had a special menu, but it included most of what is normally on their menu, with some very nice additions. Camille's calamari is outstanding. It isn't the first time we have had it. Hands down some of the best around. Also, their special occasion lobster casserole was wonderful!!!
December 24, 2013|Best Christmas Eve Dinner ever|5|The whole experience at Camile's was awesome. Starting with the friendly Valet Parking guys to the very end, Christmas Eve dinner was one of the best I've ever had. The staff made us feel comfortable. They were very friendly and courteous. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and it was outstanding. The Calamari just melts in your mouth. Definitely worthwhile experience.
December 21, 2013|Very pleased with our dinning|5|Very pleased with our dinning experience asked for a quiet table and we were provided with one. Very friendly staff from the Mai^tre d all the way to the valet parking attendants . When your spending good money for a night out its nice to have a wonderful dinning experience. The Scallop casserole was amazing , as well as the tiramisu for dessert. I would definately recommend this restaurant to more people.
December 21, 2013|A Special night out|4|A very classic and classy decor, an almost ancient greek look and feel with heavy drapes and dark subdued colors that makes for a warm and cozy atmosphere and helps to keep the noise levels down.Portions were large, almost share-able with the Pork Chops and pickled peppers entree coming with two mouth watering bone in pork chops on the plate. The Sea Bass and Swordfish entrees were also perfectly cooked and very well received based on how clean they left their plates! Dave our server was al;so very helpful explaining the extensive menu and long list of specials and the wine selctions were very reasonable with a broad selection favoring the Italian varitals. A very classic Italian experience.
December 21, 2013|Memorable|5|A great night out. Spectacular food, great atmosphere, great service. Will definitely be recommending Camille's for memorable dining experience.
December 20, 2013|Great Food|5|We went for dinner on a Friday night and the place was packed. There was a large group having an office dinner and they were a little loud but we still enjoyed the evening. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with meal suggestions. The food was great If you like seafood try there calamari appetizer. Everything we ordered was done to perfection. They have a large wine selection and the atmosphere is elegant. Management is very attentive, they came by several times to see if everything was to our liking. Meals and wine are expensive but no worse than any other high end restaurant. We will defiantly go there again for a special occasion or a nice dinner.
December 18, 2013|Excellent service and environment|5|We went to lunch - the service and servers were excellent. We were dressed appropriately but casually and got the same level of service as the folks dressed to the nines. Just excellent service
December 17, 2013|Everything was OUTSTANDING,|5|Everything was OUTSTANDING, from the host to the server! Very Friendly and Warm
December 16, 2013|Great experience all around.|5|Great experience all around. Service was outstanding.
December 12, 2013|Fine Dinning!|4|Went there for our anniversary and it was a success. She loved it the food was delicious, and the service was perfect. A must try in prov!
December 11, 2013|too noisy for business meeting ...|3|good Italian food - but wayyyyy too noisy [ on a Wednesday night ] for a business meeting of nine people
December 7, 2013|Camille's Never Disapoints|5|Over and over again this restaurant serves up fantastic service and great food. Went out with friends for a holiday celebration. This is our go to place for special events and celebrations. It never disappoints. We had another great meal. Thank you Camille's.
December 7, 2013|Night on the Town|5|Haven't been to Federal Hill in a long time, so when a friend recommended Camille's I thought we'd try it. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant until we left everything was perfect. I am not a novice at fine dining, having traveled to many locations in the world and having worked as a restaurant reviewer in the past, but I thought this restaurant was special and hope to get back sometime soon. Originally I'm from Rhode Island, and it was a treat to return and have such a lovely experience.
December 6, 2013|First time Camille's diner|5|I have lived in Rhode Island over 50 years and never had occasion to visit Camille's. I sure wish I had discovered it a long time ago. The food was prepared perfectly (I had filet mignon and my husband had the scallops), the atmosphere was elegant, and the service was better than I've received absolutely anywhere else I've ever eaten. I will definitely be returning!
December 4, 2013|Another Great Experience|5|Another great evening at Camille's. London was our server and he was fantastic. Wine selection is one of the best in the city. Will be back soon!
November 30, 2013|Very Nice|5|We went there on a Saturday evening with reservations and a party of 6. The waiter David, was EXCELLENT! The atmosphere was GREAT! The food was EXCELLENT! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
November 29, 2013|Wonderful|4|Actually, a better word to sum up the entire experience is...fabulous.
November 23, 2013|Terrific|4|I try Fried Calamari at every restaurant that I visit and Camille's restaurant has the best calamari that I've ever had! The service was excellent and the decor and lighting was pleasant.
November 23, 2013|Our 1st Anniversary|5|Bob and I celebrated our first anniversary dining at Camilles. We chose this location because it is one of our favorites and we recommend to others all the time. The food as always was fantastic and the attention to detail by Mike and Jason was excellent!
November 23, 2013|Thumbs up to service|4|Mistakes can happen anywhere but correcting them separates good service from great service, and we received excellent service from the staff and management at Camille's
November 23, 2013|Wonderful birthday celebration!|5|Camille's was a wonderful place to celebrate a birthday. Our server made sure our every need was attended to, and all staff was genuinely friendly and caring. Highly recommended to make a special occasion extra special!
November 23, 2013|I loved celebrating my 3rd|5|I loved celebrating my 3rd anniversary with my beloved boyfriend Dave at Camille's. We loved the food and service. I would have like a small salt and pepper grinder on the table and a bigger table - a four top since plates are so big. Next time I would request a bigger table since we dined so early in the evening. The candied nuts in my tricolor salad didn't taste as fresh as the rest of the salad. Overall 5 star service and food all around! Can't wait to come back!
November 18, 2013|Intimate modern family gathering|5|"We met for my wife's birthday and were lucky enough to mark the day with her sons ( my stepsons) and my mother. We were seated at a quaint table in the rear of the restaurant where it was quiet and conducive to catching up on each other's busy lives. Our waiter ""London"" could not have been more on point! As a GM in the restaurant business, this was truly appreciated! Thank you Camille's for providing the perfect backdrop to a perfect evening."
November 16, 2013|1st time visiting this restaurant.|5|1st time visiting this restaurant. Outstanding food service location and ambiance. Can't wait to go back!I had reservations this past sat night at 830. Our server was Alan. He was outstanding and handled the volume of customers with great professionalism and ease. The food was amazing (filet and gnocchi). Starting with the valet gentleman right through to when we left, I cannot say enough about our experience. I have worked in the food service industry for 20 years and was very impressed. Two days later and I think I have raved about your restaurant to about 25 people! I cannot wait to get back.. I would plan earlier next time as I would like to enjoy the lounge as well. Thank you for a wonderful much needed night away!
November 16, 2013|Camille's is a sure winner|5|From our excellent server David to our two very, very special specials that turned out to be two of the best meals we've ever had in a restaurant, every single detail of dining at Camille's was outstanding. While there are many fine restaurants on Providence's Federal Hill, if you have a special occasion (it was our anniversary) or just want a can't miss dining experience, it would be hard to beat Camille's.
November 15, 2013|We should go more often|5|"We were on the way to a ZZ Top concert at Twin Rivers and met another couple at Camille's. We had been there a few times awhile ago and had good memories of a fine experience. Well if possible it has gotten better. We were greeted warmly like old friends. We were seated and our waiter Andrew attentively presented the specials and asked about drinks. Three of us ordered the same meal, one of the specials, which is a rare occurrence. The swordfish with Alaskan crab was excellent. Fresh, perfectly cooked and very well served without being overly attentive. We can be a tough crowd but we all agreed it was an excellent experience. Andrew made sure we left in time to make the concert, just one more ""attention to detail"" that made the meal great."
November 9, 2013|My wife and I have dined at|5|My wife and I have dined at Camille's on several occasions. Sometimes we go there at night just to sit in the lounge when live music is playing. We are never disappointed. The restaurant is an excellent choice for fine dining, special occasions and late night dancing and music for the adult and mature crowd. From the Chef, Maître d, the servers and staff, they all do an excellent job! Their attention to detail is superb. Kind, courteous, friendly. Most of all, the food is excellent every time.The servers are professional and very knowledgeable. The food is excellent and prepared exceptionally well. The staff will treat you the way one expects to be treated in a fine dining restaurant. We'll be back.
November 9, 2013|never a disappointment|4|Camille's is my go to for a great meal while in Providence!!!!!!!!
November 9, 2013|Very Nice, but very Pricey|4|We enjoyed our meal, it was our first time ever going here. Everything was cooked great and tasted great, presentation was nice. However, prices were very high, that would be our only criticism. My dish was a Veal Chop and it was $45, the portion was not worth that, and I imagine the area restaurants were no where near that price.
November 8, 2013|Good food great service|3|The food was good, but a little overdone with olive oil which kept it from being great. There was a band playing in the bar area which I am sure was great for those eating at the bar but it was a little too much while dining. With that said I cannot say enough about the service and accommodating nature of everyone.
November 8, 2013|Great gourmet dining, great band !!|5|We had never dined at Camille's. What a fabulous food experience with A + service, menu selections, and superb food. We also discovered Friday and Saturday had live entertainment... The Black Tie band... We drove from Cambridge, MA and and are glad we did... We'll be back for the dining and dancing !!
November 4, 2013|Great food and service...|4|Great spot for a wide range of occasions. Large portions, but crafted very well. Great service with a professional staff that's staff eager to serve. Good for clients, that special someone or if you feel like spoiling yourself. Great diversity on the menu, made it tough to choose!
Dined on November 2, 2013|My girlfriend and I have been|5|My girlfriend and I have been dating for two and a half years now. We both wanted to try something new and your restaurant was right on point. You made my girlfriend feel special and that's important to me. We will be coming back and look forward to trying something new on the menu. Thank you for everything. Sincerely Mike palazzo
November 2, 2013|Lovely anniversary dinner|5|My husband and I rarely go out without the kids. We had a wonderful evening of good food, ambience, and service. It was definitely expensive, but we could have controlled our costs easily by making a few different choices.
November 2, 2013|Many traditional Italian dishes|5|Many traditional Italian dishes were on the menu, however Camille's had a variety of seafood specials. I chose a fabulous black cod special. The presentation was beautiful and perfectly prepared. Our server was professional, yet welcoming, very relaxing night! I highly recommend Camille's.
October 29, 2013|Best Restaurant In Providence|5|Fantastic food, wonderful decor and perfect service. The wine list was equally impressive. There's not a lot of places that offer such a selection but its obvious after dining that Camilles is a top-tiered restaurant.
October 29, 2013|Its get better with every visit|5|I have been to Camille's numerous time both in a business group setting and also on romantic get away dinners (from the kids). From the moment you arrive being greeted by the Valet the tone is set for an excellent evening. We have always been seated promptly by the managers and greeted timely by the extremely knowledgeable wait staff. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. I cant say enough about how professional and unassuming the staff is. What a far cry from most restaurants that have staffs that are not seasoned. Their motto is ask and you will receive. I've already booked my next reservation
October 29, 2013|Fantastic restaurant!!|5|Everything from the food, service and wine list was great as usual!!
October 26, 2013|Overated|3|"I have been to many great restaurants in Providence and I was not happy with Camilles. I believe this restaurant is only popular in name and that it has been around forever. My pasta was overcooked to the point of breaking into pieces on my plate, not what you would expect from an Italian restaurant. My wife had one of the specials which was ""ok"". With so many better choices around the area, it is safe to say I will not be returning to this establishment. One other comment is I am surprised at the reviews that they have received. Not even close to 4 or 5 stars. Maybe Trip Advisor should have a spot for people to put what level of restaurants are they used to. If you frequent Applebees for dinner, than this place is 5 star all the way."
October 26, 2013|Very Nice|4|Camille's was very busy on a Saturday night, Reservations a must we had a short wait for our table but Mike the host bought us drinks and dessert for our Anniversary al in all very nice place.
October 25, 2013|Appertizers were descent.|3|Appertizers were descent. Sever was ok, but I think he had too many tables to attend so he was running up and down and our order was mixed up. Restaurant food is fresh , however it had no taste. Too expensive for the service and the food taste.
October 25, 2013|Expensive but Worth It Overall|4|Good food and great service but be warned - everything is ala carte. The waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad with our entrees without telling us they were extra so the bill was a bit of a surprise at the end.
October 23, 2013|Will not return|3|I guess I came too eArly. But the amount of time I waited for a menu, bread, water, wine etc.... Was unacceptable. I saw three to four waiters talking with each other while I was sitting there waiting for a menu. When I got the menu, I hit two wine menus and had to wait again for the food menu. Food was good, nothing special though. I had the veal chop which was their special but it was ordinary....huge though
October 22, 2013|Twenty five years later|5|"I love the ambiance of this place. You walk up a few cobblestone steps and are greeted by a very large ""old"" door. The initial entrance has an old world charm. It isn't until you walk through a hallway where you will see a more modern decor. The waitstaff is extremely professional and knowledgeable. The appetizer of shrimp and prociutto was out of this world as was the Arancini (risotto balls). My husband had the chilean sea bass and I had the filet mignon. Each entree was a very sizable portion with potatoes and vegetable on the side. We were both too full to have dessert but the choices were amazing. My only regret was waiting 25 years to return to the place we had gotten engaged."
October 22, 2013|First time back at Camille's|5|First time back at Camille's in a while, and they haven't lost a beat. Food and service right on point, one of the best bottled wine lists in the state. Shrimp Fra Diavolo was phenomenal, as was the Pio Cesare Barbaresco. Dessert crepes are still a home run. We will be going back soon!
October 21, 2013|Great food, friendly attentive|5|Great food, friendly attentive service, what is not to like
October 18, 2013|Best Overall Restaurant|5|Camille's is the best overall restaurant I have been to in a long time. Every meal; from appetizer to dessert was excellent. The ambiance is beautiful and Steve, our server, was the best waiter I have ever had. We are visiting from out of town znd can't wait to come back.
October 18, 2013|Always a Treat|5|Camilles always delivers. The food, service, ambiance and decor combine to deliver the best Federal Hill has to offer!
October 12, 2013|Fantastic Service, better food!|5|"The service is second to none, the wine selection is wide, and the food is outstanding. If you are meat inclined, the Pork Osso Buco is the best I've ever had (and that is NOT an insignificant sample size)! When looking to dine on ""The Hill"" don't overlook this staple in Providence..."
October 12, 2013|Best restaurant experience|5|My wife and I were celebrating 6 years together, and i have to say it was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The food was amazing...so much food...the entree plates were gigantic servings, the service was by far the best we have ever had, our Server Steve was awesome, helped us out with an amazing bottle of wine, and the managers and rest of the staff were so nice. I recommend this place for anyone going out for a romantic night out. It was amazeballs!
October 11, 2013|Bravo Providence|5|From the very knowledgable valets to the friendly wait staff to the best calamari ever Camille's will have you covered! Superb food and exceptional service!! Bravo! We would like to thank Dan (perfect breakfast in Smithfield x2 & Columbus Feast on Sat) to Louie (Waterfire parking wa awesome) thanks also to Gary & ? At the front who made our daughters feel special and not to forget Jason who served us all with his RI accent with flair and patience BRAVO!!!
October 7, 2013|Delicious Food - Excellent|5|Delicious Food - Excellent Presentation - Spectacular Wine List - Personable Attention - And a Facility with History
October 5, 2013|Absoutely Awesome|5|Have been here before and Camille's never disappoints. Had relatives in town and wanted to show off Providence. Camille's hit the bulls eye. Fabulous atmosphere, fantastic food and service beyond expectations. Thank you David.
October 5, 2013|Dinner|4|Camille's has the old-world feel of a European restaurant. My husband and I were there for my birthday. Service was excellent. The Pasta Fagioli soup was the best I ever had! We had a 6pm reservation and did not have to wait, although the restaurant was already crowded. We each had one of the specials which were delicious. It was an expensive evening out but well worth the money.
October 5, 2013|Wonderful Experience|5|Spent the night in Providence with my husband for a quick get away. We were extremely pleased with Camille's. From the moment we walked through the door we were treated like royalty. The service is like none other and the food was amazing. Our server offered suggestions which were wel received. Can't wait to visit again.

September 23, 2013|Italian food at its best!!|5|"Camille's is that restraint that you Must go to if you are ever in providence RI , We were there for a convention. Our group decided we wanted Good Italian food!! We asked the concierge at the omni.. They suggested Camille's.. I lookeed it up on Open Table, saw the menu and the reviews and had to go!! We were so delighted with Camille's. The staff from the waiter to the manager made us feel like we were ""home""!!! And the food was beyond delicious!! The lasagna was to die for, the lobster bake was out of this world! The ambiance of Camille's is beautiful and romantic.. The manager was so kind... He did something very special for us, and I want to say thank you for the ride!! You are a true gentleman!!"
September 18, 2013|Amazing|5|My husband and I come here once a year for our anniversary. Always delighted, food superb. The wait staff and host extremely kind. We actually forgot to bring cash for the valet parking. We tried to park our own car as we did not have cash for a tip. However,, the fellow parking cars said he had to park our car. We explained that we did not have cash to tip him so therefore we would park on street. The person was just so kind told us no worries even thou we were feeling quite embarrassed. As we were ready to retrieve our car, we again offered to get it as we had no cash. The fellow wished us happy anniversary and did indeed get our car.
September 17, 2013|Like old Italy|4|This was like stepping back in time to old Italy The food was outstanding if you like tractional Italian food with heavy red sauces The wine list was very nice and the service was good, but slow One of the original Federal Hill icons, this place is like stepping back in time
September 16, 2013|best. dinner..ever!|5|Took my boss to Camile's last night. The entire evening was incredible. Beyond all expectations! We will be back again and again!
September 14, 2013|Camille Review|4|The service was absolutely outstanding and made you feel completely at ease. The food was also beautifully prepared and tasted pretty good. The ambiance was romantic and elegant, definitely a perfect spot for dates and/or anniversary celebrations.
September 14, 2013|perfect night|5|food, service, everything about this restaurant was perfect.
September 13, 2013|excellent house gravy|4|Top notch food and wait staff. Just need to turn the lights up a bit in the dining room. Always have a great special list and the menu has great range of food.
September 7, 2013|Top Shelf menu and food|5|Dinner on Sept 7, 2013 - the fish special was outstanding and the pork chops with peppers, a regular on the menu was excellent - wait staff very professional - would suggest they indicate price of specials since the fish special was a bit pricey.
August 30, 2013|timeless|5|Camille's scores high in every category. The atmosphere is what I would call relaxed elegance - beautiful surroundings, upscale and elegant without pretentiousness or stuffiness. The service is impeccable - our waiter that evening was Joseph. Even the location tucked behind the Old Canteen on Federal Hill has a romantic timelessness about it. Be sure to have an appetizer - their calamari, stuffed portabello and stuffed artichokes are all delicious.
August 30, 2013|Fabulous service and great|5|Fabulous service and great amount of food for your money! We ate so much we had to take a walk area Federal Hill area before we could enjoy the band in the bar area! It was a wonderful time!
August 30, 2013|Great food/great service|5|We have been to Camille's several times, and I can never decide which I like better: the food or the service. We had a delicious meal, and it's incredible how far everyone at this restaurant will go to please the patrons. the hard work and effort of all staff is commendable.
August 27, 2013|Camille's|4|Very very good Italian meal calamari with peppers was outstanding. Seafood de pesce was very good and my friends rib eye was great. Portions were abundant and priced accordingly. Wine list was very expansive from $30 to $2000 a bottle. Our wait staff and maitre d were some of the best well versed in the meals , specials and making us feel welcomed. Highly recommended on Federal Hill area of Providence.

August 22, 2013|Great Dinner|4|Dined with friends and thoroughly enjoyed 4 different appetizers and 4 different entrees. All were great - thanks again!
August 15, 2013|Our Favorite|5|This is our favorite Providence restaurant. We celebrated our wedding anniversary on Thursday night. Everything was perfect. Service and food is always great.
August 15, 2013|Worth A Trip to Providence|5|We started coming to Camille's a few years ago when we had a stopover in Providence. It has now become part of our annual trip to Cape Cod. The food is excellent as is the service. The regular menu is great, but the specials are incredible. No wonder it has been in business for almost a Century.
Dined on August 14, 2013|It was as though being transported|3|It was as though being transported back in time, a good old Italian eatery. The food was good, nothing out of the ordinary. The ambiance was quiet, neat and clean.
August 10, 2013|The managing and wait staff|5|The managing and wait staff were friendly, courteous and undoubtedly enjoy their jobs. The food presentation was as beautiful as the flavors cooked to perfection. The fried calamari is outstanding! It was a Saturday night, there was live music in the lounge which attracted more patrons after the dining hours.
August 10, 2013|Fine dining experience|5|Started with the beet salad,could have shared. Then on to the main course which was a special. 16oz.grilled veal chop with a wine reduction sauce. It was cooked to perfection and would melt in your mouth. My friend had scallops and he was very impressed. We both had enough food for another meal. We will definitely go back and hopefully real soon.
August 9, 2013|highly recommend|5|I took my wife for our anniversary and had a good time. The food was great and the service was outstanding. Everyone on the staff including our waiter Al were great. If it is a Friday or Saturday stop by the bar scene and enjoy. Good restaurant for that special occasion.
August 8, 2013|Awesome!|5|"Proposed to the now Fiance here, loved the food. Can't say enough about the food. Felt like the ""North End"" in Providence (which is a huge compliment in my opinion, and it is Federal Hill area after all). I usually take her to Capricios but wanted to try something new. Such a great restaurant for a special occasion. Really friendly staff, even made a great suggestion about a craft beer they were serving (FoolProof Brewery IPA). Can't praise this fine establishment enough! Thank you, Thank YOU!!! for a great evening."
August 7, 2013|Food and Service was excellent|5|Brought a business associate here from ou of town. The service and food was exceptional. Waiter was attentive but overly intrusive. The appetizers and meal were skillfully prepared and well presented. I won't hesitate to come back.
August 3, 2013|Saturday Night Dinner|4|My wife and I were very happy with our last minute selection of going to Camille's for dinner this past Saturday night. The portabella mushroom appetizer was absolutely delicious. I had the the lasagna, while my wife enjoyed the salmon and both were excellent. We topped off the dinner by splitting a very tasty creme brûlée. First time we visited Camille's and will ensure we do a return trip!
August 3, 2013|classy|5|As soon as we arrived the Valet was there to greet. We were seated promptly. The drinks and food were awesome and well priced considering what we ordered and how much they provided. Two thumbs up for class,ambiance, as well as great food.
August 3, 2013|Great night|5|great food, loaded with ambience, loved the outside very cozy and inviting. lasagna was excellent, sea bass special was excellent, special zucchini flower appetizer was amazing! from NJ but can't wait to go back!
August 3, 2013|Great meal|5|Went for an early dinner to Camille's on a Saturday night to celebrate my mother's 90th birthday, and she was not disappointed. We had the beef carpaggio with caperettes appetizer special, amazingly tender and delicious. Then the sole, shrimp fra diavolo, and pasta Bolognese dinners. All were outstanding. Took some home to leave room for dessert: tiramisu and lemon fruit tart both wonderful. The wine list is extensive. The service is very attentive and friendly here, old-school charm. Our waiter Damon was terrific. We'll be back to Camille's for sure!
August 2, 2013|We had a great experience.|5|We had a great experience. One of my favorite places to go for a special occasion.
July 31, 2013|A Special Lunch|5|To mark the end of vacation, my wife and I had lunch on the outside patio at Camillle's. It was a warm day and a Wednesday so we had the patio and the service of our waiter to ourselves. Our meal was excellent. We split an appetizer(Cauliflower Sunflower) and we both had a pasta dish. My wife had a very tasty Chicken Francese and I had the Gnocchi Serantino complimented with a meatball. We both had wine. Although a little on the expensive side, the wine was paired well with our meals. You do not do lunch like this often, but it was well worth the trip and the expense. Additionally, Michael D. remembers everyone and makes you fell welcome.
July 27, 2013|GREAT SERVICE|5|Excellent service - Waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us time to relax between each course. I called at 7:00 to change my 8:00 reversation to 8:30 and the manager did it with no problems. Been here many times - Food is always excellent, service is great and portions are huge!!!
July 27, 2013|Dinner out|5|The food was excellent. Our waiter David was exceptional. His service was wonderful and made our evening even better. We will return again soon. Also later in the evening we enjoyed the E-Water Band. A great group to listen too and dance too
July 24, 2013|Had a group of six. Our waiter|4|Had a group of six. Our waiter was the first waiter in several days that actually knew their menu and what was in their dishes. Outstanding guy. Camilles is on a side street in Federal Hill. Beautiful restaurant, great ambiance. My sea bass and lobster mashed potatoes were outstanding. Two that had the sole said it was a bit dry, but OK. Another had the lamb chop which was outstanding. Expensive, but worth it. You could take anyone here but kids - romantic dinner, business dinner, casual dinner for two, etc.
July 19, 2013|Girls night|5|My best girl friend and I had a dinner date here to celebrate restaurant week and catch up. Everything thing from the point we walked in the door to the moment we exited to even on the outside was phenomenal. The staff was incredibly friendly and was so genuine on making sure we had a great experience. I had visited Camilles before with my family for special occasions and was always thoroughly impressed! My favorite dish on the menu, by far, is the chicken parm. This item was my recommendation to everyone I knew and my expectation whenever I went anywhere else, but of course no one else could compare. On that night though, the chicken parm was good but not as amazing as I had remembered it. The whole experience was amazing though.
July 19, 2013|I brought special people to|4|I brought special people to the restaurant which has memories for me.Jack and Camille were friends.The ambience ,the server, the food were all very good.I would recommend CAMILLE'S WITHOUT RESERVATION!
July 17, 2013|Great dinner|3|We picked this restaurant for a night out during restaurant week in Providence over the summer. I did the prefixe menu but my husband did not. It was a great meal with fantastic service. I would definitely go back for a nice night out.
July 15, 2013|When we arrived it happened|5|When we arrived it happened to be restaurant week and they had a special menu for the occasion. The food was very good and the service was outstanding. The staff was friendly and they made you feel special. My only complaint was with the cannoli. The shell was soft which meant it was filled too long ago.
July 13, 2013|Excellent Service & Food|4|London was our server and he was excellent. Even drove us home at the end if the night which was a nice touch. Everyone was very friendly. Food was really good too. Nice atmosphere.

July 6, 2013|Our first time here and it|5|Our first time here and it was wonderful. The food and service were outstanding. Our waiter recommended a few items that were delicious. Definitely try the veal if you go. They also have an extensive wine list.
July 6, 2013|Great food, service and more|5|Joseph was our waiter and he was wonderful The food was great We will be back for sure
July 6, 2013|great food and service|5|this was our second time for a special occasion. and again they did not dissapoint. everything was cooked to perfection, even with our large party of 15 people, the service and the food was top notch. will definately return
June 29, 2013|Service and decor nice|3|Nice service and decor, but food off the menu a bit ordinary. The specials described were interesting creative combinations but a bit rich for our tastes. So, we ordered off the menu. The food had excellent fresh ingredients of top quality, but somehow the preparation was ordinary. Excellent waiter, very honest helping us avoid needless duplications. Not inexpensive.
June 28, 2013|Too quiet and pretentious|3|Italian should be more friendly and casual. Too stuffy and overdone for my taste. Food was good but the portions were ridiculously large,
June 26, 2013|Wonderful Time|5|"It has been a while since I had been to Camille's and I wanted to celebrate a special occasion with my daughter. The food was outstanding...and the service stellar; wonderful wine suggestions and great ambiance to celebrate in style! I couldn't have asked for a better ""mom/daughter"" night out and won't wait so long to return to Camille's!"
June 22, 2013|We went for our anniversary|5|We went for our anniversary and it was NOT a disappointment. From the moment we arrived until we left everything was just wonderful, the food mouth watering, the service impecabile the ambiance great!!!!!
June 22, 2013|Camille's was the epitome|5|Camille's was the epitome of fine dining. Server was attentive but not intrusive, a wine list that has styles, types, brands and prices for every pocketbook or wallet. Quality of food phenomenal as well as choices. Generous size servings as well. After dining in many of Gordin Ramsay's restaurants I can tell you that the experience of dining at Camille's was equal to those restaurants without the price! Thanks to all for a wonderful romantic dinner and fine dining experience.
June 21, 2013|not great|2|We were very disappointed. The waiter took forever to even come over to even get drink orders and took forever to even get our food. We actually put in our food order when he finally came to get our drink order. The steak was over cooked, the chicken parm was over fried and the sauce had no flavor. The veal in the veal francese was chewy. The salads we had barely had any dressing and we could not ask for more since the waiter never came back again to check on us. Will never go here again when we go back to providence and will never recommend.
June 14, 2013|Camille's surpasses expectations|5|The white salmon dish over rabbi and cannelloni was outstanding. The service was impeccable. One of my favorite places on the hill. The garden is now open also.
June 8, 2013|Camille's never disappoints!|5|We went to celebrate my husband's birthday and in true Camille'as fashion we had a great meal and excellent service! Food, service and atmosphere made it a special evening.
June 6, 2013|Exceptional|5|The best overall restaurant we have ever been to. A real gem.
June 4, 2013|Excellent service, menu, and|5|Excellent service, menu, and food. Even the bread was delicious.
June 1, 2013|Visited Providence - recommended|5|Visited Providence - recommended by friends in Newport & Boston - lovely, great service, more food than we could eat. My only commnet; If you don't try this place - your missing an outstanding restaurant.
May 23, 2013|Meal was Great|5|Our kids gave us a gift certificate last year and we finally used it for my birthday. The food was amazing. From the appetizer to the main course to dessert. We had the following. Scampi Alla Santiago Cassoulet Di Osso Buco Di Maiale Gamberetti Scampi Stile O Fra Diavolo Crème Brulee. We were not disappointed with anything. Portions were large, so we were able to go home with leftovers. I would definitely go back. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.
May 18, 2013|Food was outstanding!!!!!!|5|Food was outstanding!!!!!! Staff very knowledgeable about the menu. Wine and drinks excellent. Is a little pricey but totally worth every cent!
May 11, 2013|Best Italian Food|5|Without question some of the best authentic Italian food I have ever eaten. If you are looking for a romantic, special occasion check out Camille's. You will not regret it!

May 11, 2013|Great Italian Restaurant!|5|I visited Providence with a group. For most of us, this was our first time in Providence. I used Open Table's reviews to decide on this restaurant for our pre-marathon carb load dinner. The food was excellent. The calamari might have been the best I ever tasted, and the main course had the signature touch of a great chef. I highly recommend this restaurant.
May 10, 2013|Big Restaurant in Providence|5|We are very particular about the restaurant experience, and go to this restaurant all the time. We believe this is the best restaurant in Providence, and love taking friends from out of town here, who also rave about it. The service is fantastic as are the lengthy dinner specials. A personal plus is they have of late often had my favorite beer on tap - Allagash White. Most don't serve it, and it is one the best beers out there, brewed in Portland, Maine.
May 3, 2013|We were celebrating my daughter's|5|We were celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday. The maître-d overheard my husband mention to my daughter that this was her special day. The waiter wished her a happy birthday which surprised and thrilled her. And following dinner the waiter brought her a complimentary piece of cake with a candle. The food was excellent and the service was impeccable!
April 30, 2013|Just great!|5|I grew up in RI before moving to Boston for a 30 year business career. I enjoyed Camille's in my youth, and enjoyed it just as much Tuesday night in my maturity. It's a terrific restaurant to relax with friends and family over excellent Italian cuisine and impeccable service.
April 20, 2013|Dinner was fantastic! Wait|5|Dinner was fantastic! Wait staff was knowlegable and friendly. Ambiance was great, the lighting was just right and the decor was classic. We sat at a cozy table for two. I had seared sea scallops that, which were delicious and melted in my mouth. My husband had the special which was a t-bone veal steak. I don't think we talked during the entire meal wverything was so incredibly delicious! Our waiter was able to listen to what we normally liked to drink and was able to made excellent wine suggestions that were spot on. Honestly my only complaint is, it took us so long to deiscover this little gem!
April 20, 2013|Camile's was fabulous. The|5|Camile's was fabulous. The veal parm was HUGE and delicious. Their pastas are homemade and the appetizers were great. It's pricey but well worth it if you want excellent Italian food and great service.

April 17, 2013|My husband and I have gone|4|My husband and I have gone here many times and we are never disappointed. Good food and great wine (bottle) selection.

April 13, 2013|Amazing|5|Camille's more than lived up to the hype. The host/manager, Mike, was extremely welcoming and upon a mix up with our reservations, he more than made up for it by being nice and offering to buy us a drink. Our waiter, Steve, was amazing. He was very knowledgable of the menu and made a phenomenal suggestion for my dinner that I did not regret. The food and wine was by far the best meal my girlfriend and myself have ever had. The lighting and setting were perfect as well. After our meal we stayed for dancing by a great duo of singers at the bar. All in all Camille's made for the best date night we've ever had and will absolutely go back for.

We would definitely go again!!

March 23, 2013|Excellent all around|5|Food, service and atmosphere were all excellent. The ravioli were to die for...the Scallops saltimbocca were sublime. Fig bread pudding was an excellent finishing touch. Our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive...seated promptly upon arrival. The only thing I would say is a slight negative is that as the restaurant filled, conversation became difficult across the table. I highly recommend.

It is was infuriating to continually hear that our order would be ""right out"".. i used to eat here quite regularly but i wil never go back...the food wasnt worth it at all...and the offer of a free dessert ""for our inconvenience"" was so lame we refused.."

March 6, 2013|Camille's is an institution|5|Camille's is an institution in Providence and our most recent meal there was a clear indication as to why; excellent service from our waiter, Joe, his coworkers serving bread, water and clearig the table and even the valet parking our car on a cold, snowy night, very nice wine list with reasonable price points, fantastic food, old-world elegance and charm. Basically a high-end Boston/New York experience at Rhode Island prices. What's not to love? Most places that have been around this long have long since lost their way and rest on their reputations from years gone by. Not Camille's - even after 100 years. So, here's hoping they're around for another 100. Salud!
March 5, 2013|First time and took two business|4|First time and took two business colleagues out. Food was excellent and wine list extensive. We had Steve for our waiter and he was very attentive and knowledgeable; committed to making our experience first class. I will be back.

March 2, 2013|Give your review a title (optional)|5|The four of us had a delicious experience. We started with a huge portion of calamari that was some of the best I have had. The salads were good portions and bread was fresh. The entrees were all different, veal marsala, sole, scallops, and salmon. Each one was superb. We will be back again especially for the lemoncella.

February 28, 2013|This was a wonderful experience|5|This was a wonderful experience from the food to the service to the ambiance. We were 3 friends looking for a nice dinner and time to catch up that is just what we got. Our waiter was patience, attentive and offered wonderful menu suggestions. We sat and talked for a very long time and were never rushed out. I've eaten on the Hill many times but this is my new favorite, I'll be back!

February 21, 2013|My wife and I were very happy|5|"My wife and I were very happy to find a restaurant with that ""old world"" class and charm that used to be the ""norm"". As an added bonus, the food was perfect!"
February 16, 2013|Just meh|2|Given Camille's history I expected excellence but instead my dining experience was just meh. We had a reservation for 9pm but they didn't seat us till 9:30pm, then sat us (a couple) at a table meant for 6. We had to ask to be moved. The waitstaff, however, provided near excellent service. The food left much to be desired and was quite overpriced, especially if you know what other Providence restaurants have to offer. For nearly $50, I was served two day old lobster ravioli (they were heart shaped for valentines day, two days after). The produce is not obtained locally, and even fish was noted to come from across the globe, so not a place for foodies. I would not go there again. Seems like a pretty cool bar scene for the 45+ crowd.
February 14, 2013|Besides having a reservation|3|Besides having a reservation and having to wait after we got there 15-20 minutes before, we had to wait almost 40 minutes for them to sit us, and It was after my wife went to complain. The service was good, the appetizer was very good, they nicely separated into to two plates, the food.... took a little long to come out but was very good, We had and overall good time.
February 14, 2013|Hesitant to return|3|I've been to Camille's twice and both experience were like night and day. My first experience was great. The food was flavorful and beautifully presented. My second visit was not good. The food was bland especially the parmigiana mashed potatoes. The green beans were raw as if it was picked from the garden and placed on the plate. The chocolate soufflé cake was frozen in the middle with crunchy frozen bits. I'll be very hesitant to go back.
February 14, 2013|perhaps it was the busy night?|2|It's likely that the demand was quite high on Valentines day. This was my first time at the restaurant, and was eager to try as the reviews on this site are very good. My wife and I split a Cesar and the salami plate. The Cesar was quite good, a little thick, a bit strong with anchovy and I prefer more tang (mustard & lemon) no chilled plate. The Salami plate had some interesting fresh meats although the cheese, esp the mozzarella was quite fresh but nearly flavorless, perhaps too lean. I had the bone in veal chop cooked rare while my wife had the lobster/scallop plate. Although my chop was cooked perfectly, it was lacking flavor and bathed in a uncomplimentary vinegar & cream sauce.out of space. prepare to spend $85 for a 90pt wine

February 14, 2013|Valentines dinner|5|My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our selves as we had reservations for Valentines day dinner at Camilles. We sat upstairs which was ok, the tables were kind of close together and there was this really annoying couple next to us but luckily they were just finishing up! The service was fantastic as well as the food! My girlfriend had filet mignon and I had lobster fra diablo; it was GREAT. We had some good wine for a decent price and overall I just can not wait to go back.
February 11, 2013|Amazing Food!!|5|I took my girlfriend here for our two-year anniversary, and it was the perfect night. Romantic atmospher, AMAZING food, really friendly and helpful servers - it had it all. It's definitely on the pricier side of things, but it was the best meal I've had in a really long time. I 100% recommend it.
February 6, 2013|As always, Excellent!|5|Simply one of the most consistently excellent restaurants on the Hill.
February 1, 2013|Great restaurant all around.|5|Great restaurant all around. Special treatment. (Special orders don't upset them). A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.
January 29, 2013|This is a true dining experience|5|This is a true dining experience from the moment you step through the door. The atmosphere is calm, subdued and sophisticated with tables placed in a way to give space and privacy. Wait staff greet you immediately and provide an explanation of the menu and the specials for the evening. A huge amount of wines by the glass are offered as well as an extensive wine list by the bottle. Staff are well schooled on the wine list and what will go best with the meal. The kitchen seems to use high quality product and ingredients, as all the food is superburb and creative. It will be a meal you won't forget. In addition, when we inquired about a cab back to our hotel we were offered a ride in the Restaurant's Cadillac Escalade by the manager.

January 25, 2013|Group Business Lunch|5|Came to Camille's for a business lunch with a group that included customers. The food and the service were excellent. The ambiance was great and felt exclusive. The staff also cheerfully accommodated our need to get in early and begin the meal quickly.
January 23, 2013|Camille's is a Providence|5|Camille's is a Providence dining gem. The service was great. The food was delicious and the presentation was superb. I will go back any chance I get.
January 19, 2013|Could not have been more impressed|5|Could not have been more impressed from start to end, service and food quality.....the best.
January 16, 2013|Birthday Dinner|4|Food and presentation is always excellent. My main concern was that we sat next to four loud men who sometimes spoke a little risky. Unfortunately, we didn't realize this until it was to late in our dinner. Couples shouldn't be put into situations like this.
January 12, 2013|Great for special occassions!|5|The service was excellent. This will be our new restaurant that my husband and I go to for special occasions. It is pricey, but the food and service is fantastic. My husband and I both shared our entrees. The server brought them out at spaced out at different times and split the orders and served on our own plates. Winter seafood casserole was awesome. We will definitely be ordering again. The server said that even though it is a seasonal item, we can ask for it at any time. The veal wasn't as good as expected. For the $45.00 price tag it was a bit fatty and a smaller portion. The wine suggestions was great. I got a nice smooth merlot that went with both dishes. We will be going back again for sure!!!
January 8, 2013|Great night out|5|Came here for my fathers 50th birthday on Tuesday and was very pleased with the entire experience. Server was attentive to our tables needs regardless if it was a slower night or not. Our apps were nothing out of the ordinary, however all four of our dinners were great. Everyone was truly happy and the final touch of happy birthday dad in chocolate on my fathers tiramisu, perfect touch. Highly recommend.
January 5, 2013|Poor excuse for Italian|3|Overall disappointed in the food. I felt it was quantity of food over quality. For a supposedly noted Italian restaurant the tomato sauce was nothing to write home about. I asked for vegetarian options because not one was offered on the menu. The waiter was speechless for a minute. Then came back with one suggestion. With people being so health conscious these days and so many people on plant based diets you would think they would offer more. Our table was in the middle of the room and everyone of us keep getting bumped by servers no less. We were out celebrating my daughters birthday and it was not enjoyable at all. We were a party of four and the the bill was $250.00. Over pried for the quality of food you get.
December 31, 2012|One our favorite restaurants.|5|One our favorite restaurants. The food, the atmosphfare, and the service is first class. Keep up the good work.
December 31, 2012|Amazing NYE experience|5|Amazing experience at Camille's. Great service by our Waitor and staff. Great NYE selection on the menu of some of my favorite dinner and appetizer choices! We had a 8 o'clock reservation and arrived early and our table was already ready. Never saw one customer wait for a table. Nicely paced meal and no rushing which is our biggest pet peeve around the holidays so we were pleasantly surprised. During dessert we caught the beginning of the live music in the bar which was very relaxing and fun. Cannot wait to come back again!!!
December 31, 2012|The veal chop on new years'|4|The veal chop on new years' eve was very good. I was a little disappointed that some of the regular pasta dishes were unavailable that night, and there weren't any pasta-only alternatives with no seafood.
December 31, 2012|Had a great night - Proposed|5|Had a great night - Proposed to my girlfriend. The staff could not have been more supportive and attentive to us. Great night!
December 28, 2012|Best Restaurant in Federal|5|Best Restaurant in Federal Hill! I highly recommend. Service is Excellent
December 28, 2012|Beware of high priced specials!|2|Nice atmosphere. Two out of three entrees very good. Third entree special of evening. Was discribed as a little pricey but worth it. Discribed as seafood casserol. Upon arrive lobster still in shell & shrimp still w/ tails (not much of a casserol). Also not much flavor. Very disappointing. Bill came this entree was $60, waiter recommended dinner wine $18/glass, & veggie substitute for pasta $5. All done without stating prices. Overall felt very mislead by the waiter.Make sure you ask all prices before getting taken advantage of by a waiter trying to upsell.
December 24, 2012|Still a standout|5|The decor may be a disneyfied version of an old school goodfellas bordello, but the dining experience is superb. The fried calamari is in a class by itself. Veal, steak and seafood entrees are excellent. The portions are huge, but do try to save room for dessert.
December 24, 2012|We have gone to Camille's|4|We have gone to Camille's for Christmas Eve for the past 6 or 7 years and this year was one of the best. The food was very good and the service was excellent. Thank you again to Camille's for a very nice evening with my family.
December 18, 2012|Good service until we wanted|4|Good service until we wanted the check. A big group had come in and the staff was falling all over them and forgot about us.
December 15, 2012|Christmas Party|4|We went to Camille's for our Christmas Party and had a very enjoyable time. The service was outstanding. The portions of the dinners were excessive. If we had known how much food we were each going to get, we probably would have shared dinners. Thank you for a very enjoyable evening.
December 14, 2012|Our waiter, Damon, was excellent.|3|Our waiter, Damon, was excellent. Very professional. The food is way overpriced. I had filet mignon, i asked for it med rare, and it was so well done, it had no gorgonzola sauce and the worst mashed potatoes I've ever had. However, the calamari appetizer was excellent. The lounge is very nice and lively, but the band was awful. It was like bad karaoke.
December 14, 2012|If you're ever in Providence...|4|I love the interior of Camille's and the food is just as good as the place looks! There's something grand and old world, YET very modern going on at Camille's. Our server was outstanding. We had a small family group of six- each person had salad, entree, wine, cocktails and loved everything. If you are ever in Providence, put this one on your list. We've never been disappointed.
December 8, 2012|From the ambiance to the food|5|From the ambiance to the food to the service - everything was excellent. Can't wait to go back for my daughter's 27th birthday!!!
December 1, 2012|From the moment we got to|5|From the moment we got to Camille's the service was impeccable! From the gentleman at the hostess booth to the our waiter Joseph. Joseph was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the food was amazing!!!!! Would go back again!
November 19, 2012|This is the second year in|5|This is the second year in a row my girlfriend and I have at our anniversary dinner at Camille's and they do not disappoint. Its a very romantic restaurant and the food/service is excellent. The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for. Overall, it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend Camille's for a special occasion or just a romantic night out.
November 13, 2012|Based upon the reviews i thought|3|Based upon the reviews i thought the food would be better. It wasn't bad, but my group of 8 only had a few people that were very happy with their dish. Seems that the pasta dishes were all winners and all the other options were so-so. Our service wasn't great. Very slow. I have been on federal hill many times and I think there are better options available in the area.
November 10, 2012|A true gem on the hill !!|5|Everything was excellent.. Everyone that we interacted with we're wonderful, knowledgeable , friendly people!!! Our waiter was excellent!! The food was just incredible !! We had a great night !! Thank you !! Can't wait to come back and enjoy a nice cigar on the outdoor patio!!
November 10, 2012|First time to Camille's in|4|First time to Camille's in several years and they have definitely upgraded! The menu has been updated and nice ambiance, though a little pricey. Nice for a special occasion!
November 10, 2012|A great Italian restaurant|4|A great Italian restaurant in a neighborhood of Italian Restaurants. Service, atmosphere, and Food is worth the visit.
Dined on November 10, 2012|Not for me|2|A bit old fashioned and formal. Wait staff very good, but hostess not good. For me the food had no flavor. Got the chicken in lemon butter sauce, no lemon flavor. Also, found sauce kind of bland. Margarita cocktail was the best thing about this place. Waiters kept bumping into my chair all night - very annoying. Wouldn't go back.
November 10, 2012|Great meal, excellent service|5|Great meal, excellent service ........even the valet parking was first class! First time there and will definitely be back soon.
November 10, 2012|Food, service and atmosphere|5|Food, service and atmosphere was spot on. I was also surprised at the portions which were bigger than I expected. All in all, we had a great dining experience. Thank you.
November 3, 2012|Top Notch Dining|5|This is a true dining experience from the moment you step through the door. The atmosphere is calm, subdued and sophisticated with tables placed in a way to give space and privacy. Wait staff greet you immediately and provide an explanation of the menu and the specials for the evening. A huge amount of wines by the glass are offered as well as an extensive wine list by the bottle. Staff are well schooled on the wine list and what will go best with the meal. Expect the unexpected as the chefs use the best of ingredients in creative and unusual ways to enhance the flavors of the food. It will be a meal you won't forget.
November 2, 2012|We have tried Camille's a|5|We have tried Camille's a couple of times for dinner, and have never been disappointed. We decided to try lunch, and it was fabulous. The greatest part of the dining experience at Camille's (no matter the time) is the service. They will accommodate any request, never rush you, they are always polite and helpful. The food is very high quality (I'm a food snob and I'm Sicilian so I know Italian cuisine), very fresh and flavorful. Very lively bar at night with excellent service, as well. I highly recommend this restaurant; it has been around this long for a reason.
October 27, 2012|Excllent, excellent meal.|5|Excllent, excellent meal. Service and atmosphere attentive and welcoming.
October 20, 2012|One of my biggest disappointments|1|One of my biggest disappointments in dining. The special duck appetizer with the custard lacked flavor. There was not even a hint of fennel or the onion as discribed by the waiter. The duck was tastless as well. The other dish that I had was the eggplant with a veal ragu. The veal ragu was inedible, the texture was just awful, I could not even tell if it was meat or soggy breading from the eggplant. Very expensive for the quality of the food. The only saving grace was the glass of wine.
October 20, 2012|A dining experience you should have|4|Great date night spot. Get there early if you want to eat at the bar as they don't take reservations for bar dining. VERY few places do. Fantastic service by bar staff....attentive yet...give you space. HIGHLY recommend the Cassoulet! My other half had the Carbonara which was somewhat disappointing. No flavor to really speak of. Nice basket of bread with dipping oil. Had very nice specials but I inquired with the Maitre'd and he, without hesistancy, recommended the Cassoulet. Wise choice/decision. Can't wait to return to try the other tempting offerings on the wine. Very nice wine list. You will not be disappointed.
October 19, 2012|Very good among the great!|4|Definitely a fine restaurant. It fade just a tiny bit by comparison with some very stiff competition in the best city around for good restaurants, Providence!
October 13, 2012|Outstanding Italian on Federal Hill|5|Wonderful food and excellent service. Their deserts were amazing. A little pricey however.
October 13, 2012|My wife and I ordered the|3|My wife and I ordered the Block Island Swordfish special. The mashed potatoes were cold, however the rest of the meal was good. Scott, our waiter was very good. I was disappointed about the cold mashed potatoes.
October 12, 2012|Fantastic!!! A little pricy,|5|Fantastic!!! A little pricy, but simply fantastic!
October 9, 2012|Old school Italian with flair|5|A favorite of mine for old school elegant italian. Once again impressed work colleagues with an amazing traditional Italian meal with sophisticated flair.
October 6, 2012|Camille's - Mangia!|5|Fantastic food. Vivante on-site sparkling bottled water was great and nice to see Camille's doing their part being green and having the freshest local ingredients! Excellent place to eat! Chef offers great seasonal specials as well as a superb display of his culinary skill.
September 29, 2012|Our first time but not our last|5|It was our first time here and we didn't know what to expect. We arrived a few minutes earlier than our reservation and decided to order cocktails while we waited to be seated. Our table became ready before our drinks were served and our host graciously carried my wife's drink to the table. For starters we shared a shrimp cocktail appetizer and we both had the Insalata alla Cesare. Both were great. I was however disappointed to have the shrimp cocktail arrive with only 4 shrimps. Granted they were jumbo, fresh and delicious, but 4 shrimps for $20 is pushing it. For our entrées my wife had the Zuppa di Pesce and I had the Veal Chop special. Both were perfectly prepared and so bountiful that both of us only finished half our entrée. The wine
September 29, 2012|We had our anniversary dinner|5|We had our anniversary dinner there on Saturday. My husband had Australian Sea Bass, it was excellent!.. Presentation of the dishes was amazing, almost to pretty to touch (almost!).

September 29, 2012|We enjoyed the complete package!|5|We enjoyed the complete package! Food was perfect, service, and atmosphere the same. 11 stars!
September 28, 2012|great food, even better service|4|Food was very good, the service was excellent, our waiter knew the line between great service and being there too often. He was there every time we needed something. His suggestion of the pork chop was the best dish at the table. It is a little pricy but for special occasions well worth it.
September 27, 2012|A credit to Federal Hill...|3|The service, from the valet outside to the staff inside, was outstanding. The lunch menu, including specials, was not as extensive as I liked but they had no problem with supplementing it with special requests. The ambiance was off as we were the only 2 people in the restaurant, however I think were it busier it would be very good. It has a darker old world decor which I like. In summary, we liked it very much.
September 24, 2012|I took a vendor from out of|5|I took a vendor from out of town. Wanted her to experience the charm and good food of RI and Camille's was a perfect choice. She picked the steak dinner and the rsto of the group had the fish specials. We all agreed that we made the right choices. It was a quiet Monday night which made the dinner very enjoyable. The server was very friendly and his service was great.
September 22, 2012|Wonderful tradition at this|4|Wonderful tradition at this restaurant. Food is a little rich for the foodies of today.Food very good, but not extra special.
September 22, 2012|The last two times my wife|2|The last two times my wife and I have been to Camilles, the food has been very average. From burnt supposed medium Filets to Veal marsala with no taste in what looked and tasted like turkey gravy, the experiences have been fair at best. The service is great, food not so much. I wonder if the changes that took place this past year with the firing of all employes was really for the better.
September 22, 2012|great spot for dinner for 2|5|we celebrated our anniversary at Camille's - and we will return again! great food and great service.
September 22, 2012|Camille's is Awesome!|5|"Camille's was really on tonight! Service was awesome. David split salads (they are huge), and deserts at his own suggestion. He was also very helpful with wine and entree choices. The place was loud. Lots of families celebrating various occasions, but it was that happy and celebratory noise that makes you glad you are a part of it. Food was spectacular: broiled barramundi fish on killer risotto, the zuppa di pesce (reminscent of cioppino in San Fran), and the linguini carbonara were mouth watering. We took our time, spent two hours stuffing ourselves and really enjoying the energy in the room. Great family place. Go very hungry. When we left at 10, the bar was really rocking with a cool group playing ""My Girl."" What's not to love?"
September 15, 2012|Best restaurant ever!|5|We travel 5 hours one way to have dinner here. Incredible, outstanding! Our favorite restaurant hands down!
September 10, 2012|Perfect. We met with a friend|5|"Perfect. We met with a friend we hadn't seen in years so were not in a rush. Waiter could not have been more accomodating. We were not rushed ...but he was there when necessary. The ""specials"" were outstanding ...the ""chopped ceasar"" was perfect for sharing. Restaurant was recommended by a friend who did not hesitate when I asked about a good Italian restaurant in Providence."
September 8, 2012|A bucket list restuarant|4|Impressed with the quality of the waitstaff from busboy to manager. Quality place.
September 8, 2012|Had a great $25 veal parm for $29!|4|"This was our first trip to Camille's in a while.It was an enjoyable experience...excellent food, superb service, etc., but this is not Il Mulino in NYC. The issue is that Camille's price point is in the ""special occasion"" Al Forno, Capital Grille league which are better options for the expensive night out.I am not a chronic ""restaurant is too expensive"" complainer.But generally appetizers were $15 or more, no desserts less than $10, most pasta dishes $20-$25, etc. Everything was overpriced by $3-5 across the board.In the future, when we think ""good"" Italian, we'll favor other places where the quality of experience is comparable and the pricing more reasonable. After all this is still Providence! We'll return, but probably not for a while"
September 6, 2012|I took my fiance here to celebrate|4|I took my fiance here to celebrate his 30th birthday, and we really enjoyed Camille's. From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, we were treated so wonderfully, and felt so welcome. Everything we had was delicious, even the bread! I ordered the Chicken Marsala, my fiance had the Chicken Francese, and we had the calamari as an appetizer, all of the above were great. Camille's is great, and they even remembered that I had a special birthday request in my reservation, and brought out some birthday creme brulee! It was great! Wait staff here is excellent, Joseph C. was our waiter, very nice, polite, helpful, a superb waiter.
September 6, 2012|A Federal Hill Gem. While|5|A Federal Hill Gem. While the food was good, we would not give it an outstanding; maybe our idea and taste buds for Italian style cooking are set for a more southern Italian flavor vs northern. It was a desire of guests to see Federal Hill and this is one of the gems. Yes, we have had some outstanding dishes there- maybe another time to get the brass ring.
September 1, 2012|Our first trip to Federal|5|Our first trip to Federal Hill - WHat a treat! Wonderful food, ambiance and service. Sent our daughter off to college with a lovely evening. We will surely return.
September 1, 2012|Lovely Meal comes @ a hefty cost|3|We had a lovely family dinner. Our server David couldn't have been more helpful with our dining experience. We shared appetizers: the burrata,stuffed squash blossoms & Calamari were very good. David divided & apportioned the appetizers so as not to crowd the table (nice touch). Our entrees were also quite flavorful. The portion sizes were immense. Bring a healthy appetite! The downside.. our enjoyable Italian evening came at a hefty cost. Camille's Lasagna $24, Rigatoni alla Norma $22, & the Swordfish Crab special $40. For a family of 4 to have just appetizers, a bottle of wine $34 & entrees cost $200 is a bit much. There are many other less costly Homestyle Italian options on Federal Hill which will yield just as positive of an experience.
August 31, 2012|Absolutely incredible restaurant.|5|Absolutely incredible restaurant. The food was extraordinary and the service impeccable.
August 31, 2012|What an excellent experience!|5|"What an excellent experience! We chose Camilles by reading the Open Table reviews. I only wish that we could rate with 6 stars !! It exceeded all our expections. An absolute ""MUST GO"" restaurant."

August 25, 2012|The food and wine were excellent.|4|The food and wine were excellent. The sauces used really made the food as good as they were. The service was a little on the slow side, but I they may have done this purposely so you did not feel rushed. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

August 18, 2012|My husband had veal Marsala|3|My husband had veal Marsala with homemade rigatoni and he thought it was outstanding. I had fish but it had a sauce that I found to be too heavy. I would try it again but order a lighter dish.
Dined on August 18, 2012|We just randomly found Camilles|5|We just randomly found Camilles online looking for a good Italian place while in town. Turned out to be amazing - one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. Great portions, great atmosphere- the servers were amazing. Would go back there in a second the next time I am in town. Go there - eat, drink, and be very full and happy.
August 17, 2012|Camilles - A must try|5|This was a wonderful outting for our 7th Anniversary. The location was surprising easy to get into. Valet service simplified parking. We arrived early and were surprised by some amazing cocktails. Our waiter was very familar with the menu and knew details about every item, he offered recommendations based on our taste. Service was prompt and polite, water glasses never got empty, refills on drinks were offered immediately. The atmosphere was pleasant attention to every detail was so pleasant to see. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an romantic outting.
August 14, 2012|WOnderful|5|We always enjoy dining at Camille's and look forward to our next visit. Food was great and our service was outstanding.
August 11, 2012|This was not our first time|5|This was not our first time at Camille's. We have never been disappointed in either the food or the service. It's one of our favoite restaurants.
August 11, 2012|First time at Camilles but|5|First time at Camilles but will not be the last. Federal Hill is known for its fine Italian dining and I have been to many of them, but all around Camilles tops them all. Each course was better than the last. We began with tuna carpaccio and the pan seared rice balls, then to the caesar and mozzarella salads. They were all wonderful, only to lead to the entrees which were out of this world. Two of us had the veal porterhouse, a meal I had never had. It was prepared to perfection with a wonderful light sauce, mashed potatoes and green beans. The lasagna was better than home made with the chilean sea bass with lobster mashed just spectacular. We had no room for dessert so took a stroll on the hill instead. Service was extraordinary.
August 6, 2012|Awesome food and service...|5|Awesome food and service... My new favorite spot on the Hill!

August 3, 2012|This is our favorite place|5|This is our favorite place to dine on special occasions.The food is outstanding,the service very special and overall is hard to top. The new hotel shuttle service is a great idea.We will be back on our next trip to Providence. Kudos to all!
August 3, 2012|The food was good. The service|3|The food was good. The service was a little slow. There were 2 of us in my party. We were seated at 7:20pm and at that time the restaurant was relatively quiet. We had to ask for our check at 9:00pm. Usually with fine dining the waiter anticipates your needs. We had to ask for more wine/beverages when we ran out.
July 28, 2012|Dinner and dancing|5|Dinner and dancing, the food and service were terrific, what a great night at an outstanding venue! We had a wonderful night and look forward to returning soon. Michael Degnan the GM was kind enough to give me a quick tour of the upstairs which we hope to use soon for a private party. Thanks
July 27, 2012|Excellent Service, Delicious Food|5|The waiters went above and beyond to accomidate my beautiful, but temporarily crippled, friend and I. I'm not sure if it was because she is beautiful and sweet or because she is crippled, but they definitely paid us extra attention, accomidated my nicotine habit, and went out of their way to make us comfortable. They even let my friend sample a ridiculously expensive glass of wine that she loves, but did not want to pay $20 a glass for. They were kind and courteous, and the food was exceptional Italian, typical for Federal Hill, but exceptional nonetheless.
July 26, 2012|Great food, ambiance and service|4|We saved Camille's for our last night in Providence. If we had gone earlier in our trip, we probably would have eaten here more than once. Beautiful atmosphere, friendly staff and more importantly great food. We shared the special starter of zucchini blossoms which was a great idea as there were four...light even though fried and a nice beginning. We both had the Caesar salad, which we also shared...probably one of the best Caesar salads I have had. Hubby got the lasagna and I ordered the gnocchi and we were both sad we could not take away leftovers. Scott was our wait person and it was obvious it wasn't his first night...what a delight. All the staff was very professional and welcoming. Just go! Ciao.

July 21, 2012|1st class food and service.|5|Fantastic! Our first visit to Camille's. My wife and I were visiting Providence and saw many good reviews for Camilles. The wine list is impressive. My wife is gluten-free. That was no problem. She had a good selection to choose from. We both had dishes with the pomodoro sauce (gluten-free). Their Caesar salad was one of the best I've EVER had. The steak was outstanding. I ordered my meal with a side of capellini w/ the pomodoro sauce...excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant. Make a reservation. You will be glad you picked this restaurant over the many other choices available on Federal Hill. Cheers!

July 20, 2012|Delightful from beginning|5|Delightful from beginning to end. The greeting was welcoming, the staff were all very professional, attentive and helpful. Our server knew the menu and answered all our questions with ease and knowledge. When returning to the table, a clean napkin was provided. The food from appetizer to desert could not have been better! We will return to Camille's and will highly recommend it.
July 20, 2012|We initially intended to order|5|We initially intended to order off the Providence Restaurant Week menu which offered a greater choice than other participating restaurants but we were enticed by the lobster/seafood casserole. The fish was fresh, plentiful and delicious, however one criticism was that it was a tad heavy on the butter which diluted the seafood taste. Delicious, none the less. The menu is quite extensive with interesting appetizers and entries which make us want to return. It is a little pricy though.
July 20, 2012|WOnderful dining experience|5|Food and service was wonderful as usual We took friends with us and they were very pleased with our choice. We were not rushed and our server was very attentive. I look forward to our return.
July 18, 2012|You cannot go wrong with Camille's.|5|You cannot go wrong with Camille's. Have eaten here many times over the years. My most recent visit did not disappoint. Food was incredible, as always. Service impeccible.
July 16, 2012|Definitely glad we went|4|Went during restaurant week. I ordered from the restaurant week menu. My bf ordered from the regular menu. Food was delicious! Pretty big portions. Service was exceptional. Our waiter Steve gave us detailed descriptions of the food and gave us recommendations on what to try. He kept coming back to check on us and did whatever he could to make our dining experience enjoyable. I also needed plastic utensils for my leftovers since the hotel didn't have any. He was able to find me some. He gave us extra utensils and napkins just in case. Little gestures like that are appreciated. He gave us some suggestions on what to check out in Providence. He was very well-mannered. Definitely would go back to Camille's if I ever visited Providence again.
July 13, 2012|Great service. Our waiter|4|Great service. Our waiter was super attentive but didn't disturb us during our meals. Definitely an expensive night out, but overall it was a nice time!
July 13, 2012|This restaurant must have|1|"This restaurant must have gone through a change. There is no way a restaurant which has survived 100 years can be so disappointing. The menu for restaurant week was the worst I have experienced ever! We ended up on the regular menu. We had one drink each, I h bottled beer, she had a glass of wine. The bill exceeded $170.00 and our meals were unedible. I had never sent anything back to the kitchen, but I had to send my steak back. They obviously do not have a broiler man as my steak was rare even after I sent it back. The salad was acceptible, but the greens were so stringy that it was awkward to eat and ended up ""springing"" across your face as the knife provided could not saw through. The dessert was good. The nband was not."
July 12, 2012|Unfortunately not a good experience|2|Unfortunately not a good experience. Big portions of under seasoned food. Champagne served lukewarm. Waiter spilled oil from plate on friend's pants. Cocktail took 15 minutes to get. But overall food is not good.
July 12, 2012|My husband and I had not been|5|My husband and I had not been to Camille's in awhile. We were drawn there because of restaurant week---however we will be back very soon. The food was absolutely delicious! The service was great and the atmosphere was wonderful. :)
July 10, 2012|Overall, a good enough experience.|3|"Overall, a good enough experience. They need more communication between staff. We two waiters ask if we needed menus but got neither the special ""restaurant week menu"" nor wine list. We ordered a bottle of red wine and were nearly served the taste in wine glasses which had previously held white wine. Waiter was gracious & apologized when bringing fresh glasses. We ordered the formage e salumi as an appetizer, waiting to order entrees. Appie came thirty minutes later; by the time we ordered dinner, we were not very hungry so a salad and an appetizer was enough. Water glasses were only refilled once. The patio overlooks a parking lot. But the summer evening was beautiful. There was a disc jockey playing music; rap music drove us out."

June 30, 2012|Don't miss out!|5|An incredible experience! My girlfriend and i visited on June 30th. From the moment we drove up, we were treated with courtesy and were made to feel very welcome. We chose the specials which were the fried stuffed Squash flowers and fresh Swordfish. Unbelievable!
June 30, 2012|Wonderful evening at Camille's|5|We had a fabulous evening at Camille's. We had a private area upstairs with attentive, knowledgable wait staff. The food was incredible. There were 9 in our party and everyone loved what they ordered. Great experience and will for sure be back.

June 23, 2012|Fabulous meal at Camille's|5|Fabulous meal at Camille's the other night before Waterfire. My date and I had two seafood specials - grilled swordfish and barramundi (asian sea bass). The swordfish was extra thick and cooked perfectly with crab legs on top over mashed potatoes and asparagus in a light but creamy sauce. The barramundi was a delicious white, flaky fish with outstanding herb topping. Both the appetizer (thinly prepared dish of ahi tuna) and salad were also outstanding. The portions were large and we were completely satiated after our meal. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to those with discriminating culinary tastes where cost is not a key consideration. The service was also good and very attentive.
June 12, 2012|The portions are very large|4|The portions are very large so be careful. They do not believe in any vegetables. Overall it was a nice dining experience.

The menu had so many wonderful things to choose, making for hard decisions. There was only one bit of confusion regarding the description of two fish specials. Our waiter was quick to accommodate the change. We all LOVED our dining experience at Camille's and highly recommend it to everyone who loves Italian food.
May 26, 2012|The food is very good. Portionds|3|The food is very good. Portionds are too large but meat perfectly prepared, pastas are fresh and sauces delicious. The restaurant is loud and the decor is dated but good food always prevails. Service was attentive but wine knowledge is very limited.

May 19, 2012|What a fabulous neighborhood|4|What a fabulous neighborhood gem! Exceptional service, great wine & the menu is very interesting and tasty. My only complaint is that we were there for a graduation weekend special dinner and without and notice they changed their menu to a VERY small version of the menu that is on their web site and upped their prices. Many of us didn't get the food we were so excited to try after seeing it on the menu. Overall a very enjoyable evening.

We had a small group and I chose the restaurant by the reviews and the lunch menu. The menu for our lunch was much more expensive than anticipated and not what we expected.

May 18, 2012|Very expensive for what we|3|Very expensive for what we got (~$40 an entree, with one entree even $65), and the food was quite rich, with large portions (felt kind of 'weighed down' afterwards). Went here for a friend's birthday, and the ambiance was pretty appropriate. Servers were a bit overly attentive, but very polite. Didn't even look at the dessert menu after seeing what we got for what we paid for our entrees, and headed over to Pastiche instead.
May 17, 2012|Great Dining Experience|4|had a terrific dining experience for our anniversary. The food and service were particularly enjoyable. Will continue to eat at Camille's again.

Also, hard to park. I don't like valet parking---even if it's free. I dot want a stranger in my car---ever.

May 4, 2012|Wonderful Meal with Don Corleone|5|Since moving here a year ago, we've been looking for a go to restaurant that lives up to Provdence's reputation for great Italian food. Camille's was a great find. The food was excellent and the whole restaurant experience seemed authentic. The dining room doesn't turn into a disco at 10 (something we've found more than once on Fed Hill) and we enjoyed a great meal in the elegant yet comfortable environment. We'll be back with Friends and Family for sure.
April 30, 2012|My Go To Spot In Providence|5|Incredible food and service. I've been here many times before and it just keep getting better. However, this last time they did have these great new high end wine selections by the glass. Ruffino Gold by the glass? That's awesome. Can't wait to go back. If you haven't tried this place out, do yourself a favor.
April 28, 2012|You will be amazed!|5|The food, the ambiance, the staff at Camille's was amazing. Food selections are plentiful from seafood to pastas to meats. Great wine menu and dessert selections. Staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. We made reservations through Open Table and were seated immediately! Had put on the special comments when booking the reservation that we were celebrating an annivesary and a birthday. We were completely surprised to see arrive at our table a complimentary dessert plate for both the anniversary and birthday. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

April 20, 2012|Federal Hill mainstay|5|This venerable classic on Federal Hill has lost none of its traditional appeal while adding modern twists to its menu. Our waiter was both professional and personable. He was knowledgeable and passionate about the cuisine and effusive in his attention to our children. We had a great meal and a fun evening.
April 19, 2012|We were celebrating our 15th|5|We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary -- i had requested Table #44, and that requirement was met. We did, however, have a loud group in the corner behind us and at several points it was difficult to hear each other. The dinner was awesome, and our server, scott, didn't miss a beat. It was a wonderful evening, and we will certainly return. In July 2010, we had our daughter's rehearsal dinner at Camille's (20 people) --everyone loved it, and the service/food were great.

April 7, 2012|Wonderful experience|5|My husband and I went to Camille's for his birthday and we were thrilled we did. With so many good choices on federal hill, I was nervous choosing a restaurant I hadn't eaten at before...but we were not disappointed! The service was great as was the food. It is pricey, but I am happy to spend the money when the food and service are worth it, and both are he case with this restaurant. Would highly recommend!
April 7, 2012|Very attentive service, beautiful|5|Very attentive service, beautiful ambiance, excellent and consistent dishes, waiter really knew his stuff and had the abundance of specials memorized....minor critique though, waiter interrupted too much the table conversation at critical juncture points and barged in without tactfully saying excuse me or something like that...zeal for being so attentive is probably the reason, which is something that is trainable or manageable - waiter was Michael - but overall, he did a superb job
April 5, 2012|Will return!|4|Very good dinner. Worth the money. Drinks were excellent! The wine list is extensive. The only complaint is that the large-party tables are very wide so you feel like you're too far from the people across from you to have a conversation. I would recommend requesting a round booth. We particularly enjoyed the chicken egg drop soup and seared sesame tuna special.
March 31, 2012|Absolutely outstanding experience.|5|Absolutely outstanding experience. Highly reccomended
March 31, 2012|Second Time Around and Still Great!|5|This was our second visit to Camille's. The first time was so enjoyable that we brought friends along. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The food was excellent and the portions large. The wine list is extensive. The wait staff provides helpful hints and suggestions. After dinner we managed to find a table in the lounge and spent several hours dancing to the sounds of Tribeca while enjoying cocktails. A very enjoyable night - We will be back!

March 22, 2012|Great experience|5|We had a group of 7 and to a person we had great food, a great wine at a great price that was recommended by the waiter and service that was unobtrusive but thorough. My coworkers and I are on the road 3 days a week so we eat out frequently. This is now our designated spot when we are in Providence. The creme brulee was one of my best ever.

March 7, 2012|Consistently Perfect|5|Camille's is one of my go to spots when I'm in the city. My wife and I love this place because every time we go it's the same great food and service you had the last time. You really can't go wrong here. Generous portions and a wine list that certainly won't bore you. I'll be back.

March 3, 2012|My wife and have visited Camille's|1|My wife and have visited Camille's once a year for the past 4 years as she does a travel show up in this part of the country each March. We have always enjoyed the food but the service gets worse and worse. The bartenders are clueless - I waited for 20 mins to be served. I understand if it was busy, but there were 3 bartenders and maybe 4 people max waiting to be served. At dinner our waiter took approx 25 mins to come to our table to take a drink order. At the end of the meal he gave us free dessert. With this offering I decided to leave 20% (he was getting 15 prior to this) and I felt I got attitude that it wasn't enough of a tip. The service is downright awful. STAY AWAY. Plenty better places to eat in providence.
March 3, 2012|Decent food, frustrating wait|4|"I made a last-minute reservation at Camille's because we wanted to see the band playing there. We requested to be seated in the lounge. We got there at 8:15 for an 8:30 reservation. We were not seated until about 9:30, and several times we would see a table open up, and see a couple (who had arrived AFTER us) be seated. Eventually we made a little noise to the ?manager (Mike, I think) who was very nice, and eventually got us a table. So the wait was frustrating, and it felt like other people had ""ties"" and were able to cut the line. But ?Mike was very nice and tried to help out. Once seated, we had a good meal. The food is heavy, but tasty. My penne alla vodka was delicious. My fiance's shrimp scampi with linguine was not great."
March 3, 2012|Food at Camille's was great|2|Food at Camille's was great but the service was horrid. We waited 45 minutes for our table after being told we should be seated in about 10 and waited another hour and a half after placing our order to eat. Reservations were for 8:30 we finished eating at midnight!! This is a place where who you know really matters. The Maitre'D was seating people before us who he knew on a first name basis....not a good business tactic.
March 3, 2012|Amazing Food. Great atmosphere.|5|Amazing Food. Great atmosphere. Shrimp Prosciutto was amazing.
Dined on March 3, 2012|Experience a dinner of a lifetime!|5|This was a fantastic dinner that I will long remember. My wife started with an eggplant and veal rolotini which she simply loved. I started with the Scampi alla Santiago, which is like crack with a fork. The shrimps were large and succulent, grilled to perfection and finished in a Sambuca drizzle - out of this world! My better half enjoyed the (veal) Saltimbocca alla Romana, for which she was thrilled with every bite. I ordered a special, the (swordfish) Club Steak, which is a thick center cut swordfish steak served ofer asparagus and whipped potatoes with crab legs on top. All in a creamy butter sauce that was delicious. I took my time and savored every morsel. I cannot overstate how phenomenal the food was at Camille's. We will be back!
March 3, 2012|The only real issue is that|4|The only real issue is that a party was very close to us with 2 children under the age of 2. This restaurant is not geared to children, and most diners do not want children running around the restaurant when you are trying to enjoy a very good meal. Excellent chef and knowledgable and friendly wait staff.

We try to get here several times a year. we live about an hour plus away so we have to plan the evening out. But when we want some of the best food that we have ever eaten we come here. Looking forward to our next dinner with the wonderful staff at Camille's!
February 20, 2012|Can’t wait to visit again!|5|We wanted a nice lunch to finish out our three day weekend in the Providence area and we were not disappointed. The service was excellent and the food was outstanding. When my husband and I decided to split a salad (and we were glad we did, based on the portion size) the waiter presented the whole salad then re-plated it for us. We have found this type of service in traditional Italian eateries with experienced staff. The seafood was perfectly prepared and the sauces were a great accompaniment. The valet parking and easy access to I-95 help make our visit to Camille’s a relaxing experience. Can’t wait to visit again!

February 15, 2012|The decor is very inviting,|2|The decor is very inviting, a bit dark but clean. The food left much to be desired. We both ordered the special, which was sole with one shrimp served with mashed potatoes and green beans. The green beans were the only good part of the plate. The mashed potatoes seemed to have been day old. Very dry and pasty. The fish and the shrimp were heavily coated in breading and pan fried, then covered in a heavy sauce that just made the breading soggy. I do not recommend the restaurant, especially if that was the daily special.
February 14, 2012|We loved the feel of the place,|5|We loved the feel of the place, it was dark and relaxing but romantic and very impressive. I would definitely would return. The bread was good, so was the calamari. It went well with are drinks, the bartender made a very good margarita. I had the chilean sea bass with lobster mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe which was to die for, and we also had the sole with the best asparagus and parmigiano potatoes. The service was well-timed and friendly, and the drrinks were affordable. We had a few questions about a dish on the menu and the waiter was very informative.

I ordered a veal ""porterhouse"" steak; my only complaint was that there was more bone and fat than meat, although the meat was tasty. The veal came with potatoes and vegetables--very nicely done--and the caesar salad was excellent. My husband ordered the house lasagna and an appetizer special that included crabmeat and was very pleased with both dishes. Portions are large at Camille's; we noticed a number of other diners taking leftovers home. The service we received was excellent--friendly but never obtrusive."

It's also a perfect place for a peaceful, relaxing lunch. It's simply wonderful.
December 16, 2011|Nana Has always wanted to|5|"Nana Has always wanted to eat in the Italian section of Providence. One of our friends recommended Camille's and we were truly not disappointed at all. This evening was ""all"" about our 87 year old matriarch and she LOVED every moment. The food, the background music, our server David, the whole staff make Camille's a wonderful establishment. We all truly enjoyed our evening."
December 8, 2011|Best Service, Wine, Italian Food|5|Always a safe bet. This December visit, Camille's was full of holiday parties and the atmosphere was up-beat. Service for our little table of two was spot-on as usual despite the holiday crowd. Citrus-laquered sea bass was the big winner tonight, it went great with the Ceretto Arneis Blange from the wine list...and what a wine list. The best-picked selection of Italian and American wines in Providence, no matter how much it changes it always seems taylor-made to the menu. With the food their chef puts out, and the way this service staff takes care of you, I don't know why anyone would go anywhere else on Federal Hill.

The only bad thing was the shrimp cocktail presentation was pretentious and silly - 4 shrimp in a dish the size of a hubcap! Otherwise amazing and highly recommended!

Only went because nothing else available at time we wanted to go. We were so pleasantly surprised at first, the renovations which spiffed up the appearance, reverting to the elegance of the 60s and 70s.second, the attentive but un-rushed service but mostly by the wonderful choices and prep. Of the food. I continued my quest for the best Saltimboca with a home made pasta both of which were great. Appetizer was totally out of season Zuchinni flowers imported from Israel. ......and they talk about a world economy.. Wine list extensive from fairly priced to absurd. We went for a 35.00 D'Alba. Valet kept our car during pre dinner basketball game

November 5, 2011|We ordered salads to split|4|We ordered salads to split and amazingly, the one salad came on two separate plates. Much better than having to eat off of one plate. My chicken marsala was delicious. The chicken was served in an unthickened wine sauce with beautifully cooked mushrooms. My son's veal was on the tough side though. Pasta was an afterthought with a plain red sauce. Tiramisu was wonderful. Overall a good meal. Much different from the Camille's of my childhood.
November 2, 2011|Stick with the Entrees|3|"Over priced appetizers and wine list. The three appetizers we ordered were smaller than I would have expected for a normally priced appetizer. My veal dish was a larger than expected portion however the fact that it arrived on the plate warm and not hot, and then had grated cheese put on it by the wait staff before I could say I didn't want it, made it less memorable. The bread served was not of the quality I would have expected from this establishment. Dinner entrees overall were very good. The decor inside the restaurant was very upscale yet warm. I experienced a very rude valet parking jockey. After parking in their lot, entering into the restaurant I was told ""either give me your key or go find a spot on the street somewhere."""

October 15, 2011|An outstanding experience|5|During a busy 'Parents' Weekend' at Brown Univesity, Camille's (via Open Table) was not only able to accomodate 16 parents and students for dinner on Saturday night, but called me in advance to assure me they were giving us a private room in the back. The manager was very understanding when we discovered at the last minute that two people in our party were unable to attend. The service, food, and ambiance were outstanding as stated by my 5 star review, and I would recommend this fine establishment on Federal Hill in Providence to others!
October 15, 2011|We traveled from California|5|We traveled from California to Providence for the weekend. Camille's was the perfect old-world Italian restaurant on historic Federal Hill. The ambiance was beautiful, the lighting was low, and even though the house was full, we had no problem enjoying our conversation among the four of us. The service was perfect--from local young Providence busboys to older attentive waiters. The manager stopped by to greet us. The food was fabulous...better than we have found in San Francisco North Beach and as good as the great little Italian restaurants in lower Manhattan. My only suggestion to those who go is to bring a warm coat so you can walk around Federal Hill after dinner to enjoy the sights and digest the sumptuous meal!

October 1, 2011|First experience at Camille's|5|First experience at Camille's which was recommended by a friend was outstanding. The maitre'd Greeted us and told us our table was being set. We were escorted to our table and quickly greeted by our waiter and offered a beverage. We ordered 2 lemon cello martinis that were made perfectly. We were not rushed into ordering but were told the specials. My daughter ordered the gnocchi but asked to substitute the sauce for bolognese which was done without any problems. My husband ordered the zuppa de pesce and I ordered the shrimp and risotto, which was outstanding. The food ,service and atmosphere was perfect. Can't wait to return to Providence to eat here again!
September 30, 2011|The atmosphere was a little|3|The atmosphere was a little too stuffy for me. Food was good but I don't think we'd go back. We will look for an Italian restaurant with a more energetic atmosphere.
September 16, 2011|A review from eastern Connecticut|5|Because we live in eastern Connecticut we make try and get to Providence for dinner every once in a while. When we go to Providence we like to have an up scale dining experience. Camille's is just one of those places. The atmosphere is old style cool, you could see Frank Sinatra and the boys stopping by. The service is second to none. The staff is very attentive but does not hover over you. And they are happy to offer advice and suggestions. They haven't steered us wrong yet. And the food, well it is superb! We are looking forward to our next visit to Camille's. Our mouths are already watering.

September 13, 2011|I had business collegues in|5|"I had business collegues in from Minneapolis in the Boston area and decided to take them to dinner ""on the Hill"" rather than the often times recommended Boston North End. Camille's proved once again to me to be a fine example of all of the best of what Federal Hill has to offer. Everyone was impressed and I have no doubts that when they return home they will be sure to rave about Federal Hill to other travelers."
September 10, 2011|Real Federal Hill Dining|5|We were plesantly surprised with the overall quality of this restaurant. The food was excellent (try the bone in veal Camille's) adn the service was top notch. I used to come her for business lunches but the dinner exrpience was much better. A nice relaxing first class meal.

As always, the food was excellent, but the service was poor and the noise level high — not unlike most restaurants at night. However, the live music from the bar was horrendous!!! Not just noisy, but amateurish to put it mildly.

July 23, 2011|Food was amazing. Manager|4|Food was amazing. Manager was very welcoming and hospitable. Wait staff was very attentive. The tuna was out of this world, done to perfection with coconut lime risotto, which was unique and a fantastic combination. The only bad impression was the hostess. She seemed annoyed or to be snobbish, which was the first impression we received as she was one of the first we encountered of the staff. There is valet parking, so beware if you come in from behind the restaurant, the sign is hard to see from near the back road of the parking lot. Overall it was a definite destination for providence, RI. Delicious and spectacular ambiance.
July 23, 2011|Can't wait to go back|5|Everything was prepared just the way we ordered it and great for sharing. Portions are generous. We split the meatball appetizer, a salad and each had our own entry - the filet and sea scallops (which were huge). Added a lovely bottle of La Crema wine and a perfect evening was had by all!
July 16, 2011|The food took alot longer|3|The food took alot longer than anticipated, the waiter apologized twice for the length.
July 16, 2011|A good night out|4|Camille's has been a well known establishment on The Hill in Providence for some time, and on a weekend you are going to need a reservation. The quality of the food falls just short of excellent, though their menu lacks a certain creativity that could very well set them apart from the rest of the restraunts in Providence's Little Italy. The staff was great going out of their way to set up an extra table outside for my date and I. The staff was almost over attentive with frequent visits to the table. Eating outside is a great experience, though as the night goes on the patrons at the bar tend to get a little loud, but it is to be expected. Overall if you are looking for a well prepared, basic Italian menu you will not be dissapointed.

My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and wanted something slightly more upscale. Camille's definitely fit the bill. It was lovely! The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. We loved our waiter Anthony too! I highly recommend this restaurant and we'll definitely be dining at Camille's again!
July 16, 2011|AWESOME!!!|5|My husband and I went to Providence for a weekend trip. We were told about Camille's by a friend who lives in the city. We were a little nervous after reading reviews on yelp. But the restaurant was awesome. He got the Zuppe Seafood Pasta and I got the Filet with Sage. It was delicious!! And we are so picky! The manager of the restaurant checked on us two or three times and our waiter was so helpful in picking out a bottle of wine to go with our meal. It couldn't have been more romantic :)

May 29, 2011|Great Family Celebration!|5|Our son graduated from Brown over the weekend and we choose Camille's for our family celebration. Not only was the food wonderful and good sized portions, but the ambiance of the restaurant was authentic Federal Hill Italian. The bartender was very nice offering congrats to my son, and our waiter was very attentive. Our favorite dishes included Veal Parm, Veal Chop Milanese,and seared tuna...the pasta was fresh and appetizers and salads perfectly dressed. Thank you for completing a memorable day in Providence.
May 28, 2011|The food and service at Camille's|1|The food and service at Camille's was amazing like always! We had a scheduled reservation, enjoyed a drink at the bar and was seated on time. The staff was professional and polite. The atmosphere in the dining area was rather unusual. There were a group of six people and two of the men were very obnoxious. It was very difficult to ignore as they insisted on engaging the entire dining room in a floor show. One of them stood on a chair, banged glasses with spoons and made repeated toasts, while insisting that the seated paying customers stand and play along.

They had never been to Camille's in all their years here in Providence, so they were very excited. We had a round table for six people. Everyone enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant first, but the food was OUTSTANDING!! Everyone's dish ordered was beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. The waiter we had was terrific, attentive but not overly so. Overall, it was a hit with everyone. Well done Camille's!
May 7, 2011|Worth the trip|5|This was my first visit to Camille's and I was impressed. The wine list was extensive with numerous Italian selections as well as New World options. The menu is filled with traditional Italian dishes and some unexpected finds, such as sushi. The only reason I gave the servise 4 stars was our waiter failed to tell us about the specials. We saw a meal go by which looked so good we asked about it - chilean sea bass with lobster mashed potatos, it would have definitely been my first choice. The lasagna was still wonderful and tiramisu outstanding. The restaurant has valet parking, which is an added benefit in Federal Hill where parking is a challenge.

The eldest woman at the table was invited to take home the Easter plant that served as the centerpiece. It was a perfect ending.

It has been Decades since I have received service like this (La Valencia Sky Room, La Jolla, CA the last time). It is something you should experience yourself.

My dinner was luke warm and my whipped potato and asparagus were ice cold. It was very dissappointing to bring friends there for their 40th anniversary pay 375.00 for dinner and get a cold just ok tasting meal. The wait staff was very good and I did enjoy that the food was not rushed. I hope that holding dinner did not cause the food to be cold.

In my first visit back in 2010 the restaurant was packed all night. The bar area was just as busy as previous.

Service was slow (especially considering we were the only ones in there @ 5pm) and the food is pricey but the veal and stuffed Moz was worth it. $65 for the Baked Lobster Caserol, I expected more then 1 shrimp and 2 scallops, but thats probably why I am over wait. =P Food was all top notch though.

Beyond the quality food, you can't beat this place for attentive service and ambiance. You pay for it...but it's worth every cent!
February 12, 2011|Overall a good experience.|3|Overall a good experience. Our table definitely had room for improvement - we were seated right next to the kitchen and it was very loud and annoying with everyone constantly going in and out of the kitchen,(and bumping into my chair during the process). Definitely would refuse that table if offered it again and would wait for a better table next time. The only other complaint was that I ordered the filet and it had a totally burned taste throughout despite the fact that it was cooked rare. It was like the grilling on the top/bottom were burned and made the whole steak taste that way. It was edible but I really should have sent it back. The rest of the food was good and overall a good experience.

The menu was extensive without diminishing quality: the food was very good, and service was helpful and time conscious (i.e. they didn't bring the food out too quick so that we felt rushed, but they didn't take too long so that we were wondering what was taking so long). They were polite and constantly available. I think they were a little disappointed that we weren't buying many wines/alcohol, but they still got their money's worth from us (as did we). I would recommend Camille's to anyone visiting Providence... the only other problem is that it's a bit removed from the core of the city, but don't afraid to take your car - there's valet!

There was a band playing and for me i was just too loud. However, everyone was having a great time. Can't wait to get back.

January 24, 2011|Almost Perfect|3|This restaurant has the best wine list I've found in Providence. I'm a diner for whom ambiance is really important -- for me, one of the pleasures of eating out is the privilege of eating in a visually beautiful environment. On this front, Camille's is a bit stiff; they clearly tried hard, but it doesn't hang together, and the food is good, but not great enough to make me forget that. Next time? I'll eat small plates in the bar. Service is really exceptional here -- good without hovering and very knowledgeable.

December 17, 2010|Camille's is without a doubt|5|Camille's is without a doubt one of the premier Italian restaurants in the US. From the service, to the food, to the ambiance; Camille's is without peer. I had their classic lasagna and my lady had Champagne Risotto (off the menu). The food was superb. Everything from the table bread through the appetizer and salad was wonderful. My lady could not get over how WONDERFUL her entree' was and my lasagna was tender, meaty, and bursting with fresh basil and other flavors. The service was extremely attentive without interfering with my nefarious plans for a rare romantic evening. Expect to pay $60-$70 per person including alcohol and appetizer (we couldn't even contemplate desert) and spend about 2 hours from start to finish.

November 29, 2010|The decor is outstanding,|3|"The decor is outstanding, as is the attentiveness of the staff. They brought a nice basket of breads and olive oil to the table quickly. Appetizer was fried calamari, which was good, but I thought the pieces were cut too thick for my taste. I would have enjoyed thinner ""rings"". The salad was very good and fresh with a wonderful vinaigrette. My entree was veal parmigiana served with penne pasta. Veal was not tender and seemed overcooked. The pasta sauce was somewhat acidic and had an overdose of oregano with an underlying taste of salt pork. The pasta did not seem to have been cooked fresh, but even if it was, it was overcooked."

The food was great and the wait staff very attentive. The only drawback for us was the seating. The tables for two along the booth are very close, not private enough to not overhear others conversations. Having called for reservations, I assumed we we have received better seating.

November 6, 2010|Average at best.... The restaurant|2|Average at best.... The restaurant was highly recommended by some friends who had students attend college in the area. So for parents weekend at our son's college we booked thinking we would have a special fabulous dinner. Nothing about this place is outstanding. My fish was undercooked and bland. The Italin dishes that the rest of the family ordered were basic, and overpriced. I cook better veal parm at home. I would not recommend nor would I return.
November 6, 2010|We very much enjoyed our meals,|5|We very much enjoyed our meals, however one of the members of our party was not pleased with the sauce on her pasta. The sauce on the Chicken parm was good but on the side of pasta it was thick, pasty and bitter, more like plain tomatoe paste. I have to agree that it did look like that. Cost of the meals was a bit pricey so wouldn't frequent the restaurant except for special occasions. But overall we were pleased but not sure when we will be back.

Speaking of Special, when my wife ordered haddock as a special offered by the waiter my wife asked that one item be eliminated from the toppings on the haddock, this increased the price of the dish by $10.00 making it $40.00. This should be conveyed to your guest if this is the restaurant's policy. Not to be a picky person, but I found that ridiculous when we were spending a lot of money as a party of six. Dinning experience was great, but we still are talking about the ""special!"" For that, instead of giving this restaurant a 5 Star rating, I would have to give it a 4 Star. Sometimes we can be a penny wise and a pound foolish."

We were not disappointed; the food was absolutely excellent! Also, the restaurant topped off our anniversary dinner by giving us two huge pieces of chocolate cake on the house, with ""happy anniversary"" scripted in chocolate around the outside of the plate. A very nice touch and we couldn't have been happier! This is really Federal Hill dining at its best."

Amazingly, the manager even remembered us from our prvious visit and mde of feel very welcome. As residents of the wine country of Northern California, we are not easily impressed by a wine list. We are spoiled by what is so easily assembled by our local restaurants. But Camille's has a nice wine list, reasonably priced with lots of intersting choices. I know I won't visit Providence without a stop at Camille's.

My experience at Camille’s Restaurant from start to finish was AMAZING! From the time our car door was opened by the courteous valet, Ryan, until he returned the vehicle back to us at the end of our evening we could not have ask for anything to be different. We started at the bar and enjoyed a signature martini which was recommended by the attentive bartender Jen. We were seated for dinner right on time in your beautiful dinning room, only to be served one of the best Italian meals the 2 of us have ever enjoyed, our server Manny can only be described as Top Notch, the wine he recommended was the perfect choice.

I upgraded to the lobster mashed potato and they were sweet and full of lobster. My wife had the swordfish and it was poached, very juicy and tender. I had the caprese salad and was standard, my wife had the Caesar salad and it was a little limp. Must be made up ahead of time. I also ordered the Toro Toro off the Credu menu, it was very good. The service was top notch. We stayed after our meal, for the band in the bar. was a fun filled night.
July 31, 2010|Lynn, MA|5|Service was impecable. My husband went to refill my wine glass and without missing a step, our waiter seamlessly reach for my husband's had and without fail took over the task.

I finally got around to dinner at Camille's last Thursday...great wine list with plenty to choose from, both in the, ""bang-for-the-buck,"" 50-100 dollar range and the rarer, more expensive bottles. The focus is on Italian and American wines which seems just right for the menu. Everything was absolutely delicious, though if there was a stand-out it was the prosciutto-wrapped shrimp appetizer. There was some big conference at the Convention Center, which made for what I was told was an, ""extra-busy,"" Thursday night at Camille's. I wouldn't have known if I hadn't been told, as the elegant dining room was pleasantly calm and the staff didn't miss a beat. I will be going back soon to try out more of the extensive menu."

June 26, 2010|We were a little disappointed|3|We were a little disappointed in the noise level. There was a party in the ajoining room and they were off the charts loud. I had asked on the Open Table reservation for a secluded, romantic table and instead was seated right next to another couple when there were plenty of seats available. We went from being rushed in the beginning of the evening to not being able to find our waiter at the end. Food was decent, not great. First wine choice was brought with the wrong year and that was all they had. All-in-all, the experience was good, not great.

The food, while good, was not worth what we paid. Was there a week before on a business dinner and the service was equally slow.

May 7, 2010|Great service. Great food.|4|Great service. Great food. A little slow it felt for a Friday night. Have been there before and will be back again. Only complaint is that it seems they have changed their wine glasses from Riedel to something far less expensive. It's too bad I had to drink such a good bottle of wine from a terrible thick rimmed glass.
May 1, 2010|Disappointing. Food portions|3|Disappointing. Food portions were much too big. My husband's veal Parmesan was enormous, but very dry. My barramundi was good but portion was too big, served on an over-sized metal platter, with sides of potatoes and asparagus crowding the table.
April 28, 2010|The food is absolutely wonderful,|4|The food is absolutely wonderful, from the bread to the dessert. We dined early, and I was impressed that the hostess sat the other diners that arrived away from one another. So often, even when a restaurant is all but empty the staff seats all the guests in a cluster. The only criticism I have was that our water glasses were often empty and we weren't asked if we wanted a second round of drinks for quite a while, which was surprising as we were so early and there were so few people in the restaurant. However, I've dined at Camille's once before and this was not the case at that time.

I had one glass of Malbec that was the best I had ever had. The Caesar sald was tremendous. Just the arrangement of the anchovies was perfect. My entree, of course, had to be shellfish given the location. I ordered linguine with white clam sauce. But instead of thin, scaly shelled clams, I enjoyed 15 w inch clams, mixed with smaller minced clams. My older boy devoured the shrimp scampi. My younger boy ordered spaghetti and meatballs. This was our only minor complaint. The 2 meatballs were the size of baseballs and had to be cut up. They just didn't look good on the plate.

He was attentive responsive as ever. I dropped my fork and before I could look for it he was coming over with a clean one.....outstanding attentiveness! He was very knowledgeable of the menu and wine list. The food was another surprise with not just fresh ingredients but remarkable perfection with the best fillet mignon I have tasted.

I was also given a long stem rose in celebration of the holiday, which was a nice touch. We started with a 2007 Bastianich Friulano ($40), he ordered the cold cut plate ($15) and I had the arancini di riso ($10), both excellent. For entrees, he chose the norwegian salmon ($38)(Set over whipped potato topped with Alaskan King Crab and Poached asparagus in Champagne garlic cream), and I had the filet mignon ($43) (with Parmigian whipped potatoes, Barolo wine sauce, Maytag

The staff was very good and took care of us like we were the only ones in the restaurant. Valet parking was very nice. They directed traffic for us down the street so we could get around a pushy limo driver. The only thing that was negative was the side pasta that came with dinner. Both of ours were a little on the overcooked side almost like it sat for a bit. Reading other reviews this seems to be alot of peoples only complaint. Order mashed potatoes instead of pasta.
February 13, 2010|The only complaint I have|5|"The only complaint I have was the lack of communication with respect to the ""additional"" cost for substitution. Rather than mashed/veggies, I asked for pasta and figured to be a cost associated with this but not at the expense of a half-order on the regular menu. It might be wise to let the guest know that it will be at least the charge of a half-order so that one can make a determination rather than catching the surprise at the end."

It can be pricey if you want it to be, but the traditional pasta dishes are quite reasonable, not to mention extremely good. Both the homemade gnocchi and meatballs were fantastic.
December 7, 2009|We live in the Providence|5|We live in the Providence area and eat out alot in the city. We had not been to Camille's for at least 5-6 years as the last time we visited the food did not impress us. Exactly what has changed we don't know, but the whole experience was first class! Superb, flavorful cuisine, knowledgeable waiter and an ambiance that was sumptuous and conducive to conversation ( so rare these days! ) We will go back and we will spread the word!

We had just come from the Providence Performing Arts Center to see the production of ""RAIN"". Our dinner was the perfect ending to a great day."
November 24, 2009|I frequent many restaurants|5|I frequent many restaurants but this is in my top three. Service is always top notch and the food is unbelievable. Prices are a little high but you get what you pay for. Some tips to those who are looking to go and visit Camille's: Go on a Thursday night, split a pasta dish as a pasta course, try the shrimp santiago, and if you are with a group of friends ask for the small private dining room on the first floor. Again, this place is awesome and if you haven't given it a try you need to.

At times, the service made me feel like a second class citizen. I spread the wealth and enjoy frequenting many restaurants. I felt as other patrons make Camille's their regular Saturday night hot spot.

I'm never let down and look forward to going when plans are made to eat at this restaurant. This is a place with high standards for their staff as they are always extremely well-informed and will suggest their favorite items/drinks, in detail, and answer any questions that a client may have. Many times, after we leave, our guests state that Camille's gave them one of the best (if not THE best) food experience they have had in a long time. That is a wonderful compliment and I love hearing that as I feel the same way every time I eat at Camille's. Anytime someone asks for a great dining exp, I will continue to recommend Camille's!
October 31, 2009|Whenever we are in Providence,|5|Whenever we are in Providence, which is a handful of times each year, Camille's is always one of the restaurants we go to. The menu is broad enough to satisfy everyone from vegans to beef-eaters, and the food is ALWAYS great.
October 31, 2009|Great, lively entertainment|3|Great, lively entertainment in the bar which we enjoyed after dinner. Four very talented singers, singing primarily soul music.
October 30, 2009|We went here for my husbands|3|We went here for my husbands birhtday. The food was wonderful. The noise level was different. We went out for a romantic birhtday evening,,, there was music playing in the restaurant..quiet..romantic, then there was a live disco band in the lounge. You could hear both at the same time it was very difficult. I also called and told them it was my husbands bday ahead of time and I noted it on open table. The waiter did not know, so I told him. I have never been to a restaurant that did not bring a piece of cake out. I had actually requested it. I was really disappoineted. Flemmings, the Capital Grille, do a wonderful job with special occasions as does Mortons.

October 19, 2009|I hadn't been to Camille's|5|I hadn't been to Camille's in decades, since I was a child. What a surprise! It had been completely renovated. The decor is beautiful! A smiling gentlemen welcomed us to the restaurant and from then on everything was perfect. I had a special which was a rack of lamb over mashed sweet potatoes with a poached pear. It was a best lamb I ever had. The service was A+. I didn't realize such a gem was so close to home! Rooms were sectioned off by beautiful hanging fabrics of what looked to be silk shantung. A great restaurant for two or a large crowd!

October 16, 2009|Excellent. Do not miss this|5|Excellent. Do not miss this restaurant. Service, food, ambiance, wine list - all were excellent. We will go every time we are in Providence - which should be four more years, if he keeps his grades up!
October 10, 2009|I've been to Federal Hill|5|I've been to Federal Hill for great Italian food before, and Camille's is as good as anything I've ever had. My date had the swordfish while I had the baked rigatoni - both were outstanding. We had a nice bottle of Antinori Chianti Classico wine, and started our evening with a portobello mushroom appetizer - everything was simply outstanding from the service to the stemware. Also, we went on a busy Saturday night with Water Fires going on in Providence - the staff was very pleasant and friendly although they must have had a hectic service. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the Federal Hill area - good stuff!
October 10, 2009|Camille's is at a perfect|3|Camille's is at a perfect spot on Newbury Street. It was a warm October evening so we had dinner outside with a lovely view of the Newbury street scene. The food was good but not inspiring. The service could not have been better, very friendly waitstaff. Worth a try especially if you can get an outside table.

September 3, 2009|Very nice atmosphere but food|4|Very nice atmosphere but food was not as great as it has been in the past and the service was a bit less attentive than in the past. Requests had to be made twice for water, wine list was never given to us...just little things we had grown to expect from such a high quality restuarant. Prices are also rather high for these times. Since we were celebrating my birthday and anniversary we would also have expected the one dessert we ordered would be complimentary yet it wasn't. But you can go to a chain restaurant and they would take care of that. Just the little touches go a long way.
August 26, 2009|When the waiter delivers a|1|When the waiter delivers a huge portion---you know the food is usually not good--very big portions--very small taste--no value whatsoever.
August 22, 2009|A very slow start on the service|4|A very slow start on the service quality with an apparent mix-up between waiters on who was assigned our table. After more then a couple of appologies and a free round of drinks the night turn out to be very enjoyable. The food (filet and sirloin) was great with generous portions. However, I wouldn't recommend the tables for two on the main pathway to the dining room, too hectic and not necessarly the most romantic section of the restaurant. I would go again but it may not be my first choice on Federal Hill.
August 22, 2009|Overall a good experience.|3|Overall a good experience. I had the special which I often do and found it to be good but not great. When I got the bill and the special entree was $65.00, I was flat out disappointed. There are plenty of other restaurants on the Hill. I won't go back anytime soon.
August 21, 2009|I would have never found this|4|I would have never found this great gem if it wasn't for OpenTable. Now I am recommending it to everyone. The service was great! Food was just like being back in Italy. I will be back there will friends. Also, if I was an paid affiliate for this place I would be rolling in the $$$.
August 17, 2009|Old world class and charm.|4|Old world class and charm. Superb service and great ambiance.
August 15, 2009|The food and service were|4|The food and service were absolutely outstanding. The restaurant was not full, but is very open and if it were, I suspect it would have been much louder than it was. The patio was an excellent place to have a cocktail or two after dinner, but the music could have been a tad quieter to facilitate conversation. I will definitely go back again!
August 13, 2009|The room was very, very noisy.|3|The room was very, very noisy. Our waiter disappeared for long lengths of time multiple times throughout our dining experience. The food and drink were VERY pricey!!!

July 25, 2009|We went to this resturant|2|We went to this resturant since it was advertised as having a special menu for Providence Resturant Week. When we got there we asked about the special menu and were told they did not have one. They have an extensive menu and since we were there - we ordered and had a very good dinner. I sent the resturant an email Sat. night when I returned home (just in case I did not read the fine print) and here it is two days later with no answer. We took friends who had never been there and went because it was part of a special.
July 13, 2009|This was just what we were|4|This was just what we were looking for. We were meeting a friend whom we hadn't seen in a while, and we were able to have a delicious, extended dinner. We were not rushed whatsoever. And it was a great place to have conversation as it wasn't noise at all. The service was excellent, and the food was, too. The portions, however, were ridiculously huge. Usually that's a turn off for me, but because everything else was so terrific, we just packed up the leftovers and enjoyed them the next night.
June 6, 2009|I've been to Camille's several|4|I've been to Camille's several times now for both family and business dinning. The menu is very comprehensive. The portions are on the large side, so be careful ordering multiple courses! Ask for a table near a wall, they now have curtains between some tables and this provide a little more privacy and romance. The valet parking is a blessing in that area of town. Ask for some meatballs as an appetizer.

I feel that there are better values in the providence area.

May 2, 2009|We have been to Camille's|2|We have been to Camille's several times over the years, but this time was extremely disappointing. Our waiter was good, but we had to ask for bread while we waited for an appetizer, unfortunately, the Italina bread was a bit stale. The rest of the dinner went downhill from there. I ordered a breaded veal chop with PINK sauce, it cam out over cooked, and with RED gravy SPARINGLY on top of it. We had one of our favorite desserts, Chocolate Hazelnut crepes, with almost no chocolate sauce in the crepes. And while we expected to pay a bit more for Camille's, I must say $3.00 each for tea and coffee is a bit over the top. Needless to say, in this economy, a special occasion would be best celebrated elsewhere.
