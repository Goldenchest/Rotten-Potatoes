ays ago|Great Food!|5|The food was excellent! We had a great experience celebrating a friends birthday. We were one of a few tables occupied and while the service was good, I wouldn't say our particular server was outstanding. We would certainly go back!
ays ago|Good but not great|3|Decor is very interesting and nice, but aside from that all else was just ok. The tuna was good but nothing special, the swordfish was mediocre, and the truffle ravioli with turnips atop was heavy and strange. The only great dish was the calamari app. Our waiter was a bit weird and he seemed impatient to get us to order quickly and give our check at the end of the meal. Overall we all thought that the restaurant is very over rated given RI Monthly's Best awards. Too many other great places to go in Providence.

February 20, 2016|Our favorite place but avoid the lobster bisque|5|We took our out-of-town guests here because the food and atmosphere are wonderful. The only item that was universally disliked was the lobster bisque. If you love rich bisque with a savory sherry taste, you will not like this bisque. Variations can sometimes open one's palate to a delightful discovery. This is not the case with CAV's lobster bisque. It is almost guaranteed to disappoint.

February 14, 2016|Amazing find|5|Took my girlfriend here for Valentine's day and she was blown away. We are both adventurous people with a love to travel , and we felt very comfortable surrounded by the amazing cultural art pieces from around the world displayed on the walls, as well as the brilliant ethnic antiques and artifacts. It wasn't gimmicky either. The atmosphere was elegantly designed. The host and waiter both had different accents which added to the experience. Can't wait to go back!
February 14, 2016|Great, as always|5|Visit after visit CAV always delights. Tucked away off a little park this beautiful little restaurant has a great staff, serves great food, and is a staple in the community. Highly recommended. I last went on Valentine's Day and everything was perfect.
February 14, 2016|Fantastic decor...worth price of admission!|4|However, limited dinner menu, I would go for ambiance, lunch/brunch and probably would think better of overall experience.
February 14, 2016|Christine|5|Beautiful eatery with a very romantic atmosphere with great food and service!!
February 14, 2016|Still one of the best hidden gems!|5|CAV never disappoints! We wanted a romantic place for Valentine's Day, with good food , a place that would not rush us. They had a prix fix menu but we still could order off the regular dinner menu too. Great ambiance, and perfect for a Sunday afternoon. Great for brunches also, and also a great place for small plates and sharing. And the food....always wonderful, fresh and innovative without being over the top.
February 14, 2016|Great experience... Once we got to the table|4|Amazing brunch experience with only one complaint; the host. We arrived before our reservation time of 10am and walked into a well prepared restaurant with smiling servers anxious to begin a busy Valentines Day. Tables were set and polished, and no last minute scrambling like you might expect at opening. Only problem was, the host (manager?) was not there to seat us. We stood for 5+ minutes, and it even concerned the servers who noticed us but were unable to seat us. There must be some rule that servers can't seat tables or something, but if that's the case, the host stand shouldn't be left unattended for more than the 30 seconds it takes to bring guests to their table. Once the gentleman working the front arrived, he brought us to the table. Fortunately, our server watched from afar and saw that the host hadn't sat us with menus, so he brought them with a warm greeting and everything was great once he (Curt) took over. 10 minutes into seating, the same host from earlier came by to confirm the name on our reservation. He must've forgotten to mark us in the computer. Either way, server was great! Prompt, friendly, attentive. Food was excellent, lobster bisque could use some chunks of lobster though. Overall, a great time. Get it together host stand! You're the first impression!

It was a mistake to go on Valentine's Day eve with a packed house and two dining options - pre-fixe and a la carte. After a lengthy wait for our starters, we waited almost 90 minutes for our entree which was lukewarm. No manager ever came over to apologize nor was any peace offering proferred. We didn't bother to stay for dessert and coffee. Huge disappointment after rave reviews by others.
February 13, 2016|What could have been a disaster, turned out okay!|4|This was our first visit to CAV and it was Valentine’s Day weekend – our waiter remarked that it was the busiest he had ever seen the restaurant - So, factoring that into the experience, overall CAV did fairly well. We were seated on time at a quaint table. Water and bread were brought over promptly. Our waiter stopped by, explained the Prix Fixe menu special and said he would be right back to take our drink order. After quite some time, he returned, took our drink order and we ordered the Prix Fixe menu. We ordered a pair of classic cocktails – Negroni and Side Car. After an interminable wait – like almost 15 minutes, the cocktails arrived. Both were completely wrong and were just awful. We told the waiter and he took them away and fortunately they were taken off the bill. Dinner continued on an upswing – food was very good and the wine list was decent with about a twice-retail markup depending on the bottle. Service was always polite and friendly and although we waited quite a long time for the awful cocktails, the pace from that point on was fine. Judging by our experience, the back of the house and wait staff seem fine. The bar, again, from my vantage point needs lots of work. I should have suspected something based on the ample list of “specialty martini’s” at the table… We will return – prices were reasonable and the food, service and wine hit the mark.

February 13, 2016|Yum!|5|Love the lobster scrambled eggs on Portuguese sweet bread. Lobster. Need I have said more?

The food ranged from..just meh...to not good. We had the coconut shrimp app. And their special ahi seared sliced tuna. The shrimp was OK. Not an ounce of coconut flavor, way too chewy and the sauce was pretty unimpressive. The tuna had good flavor and the aioli sauce was tasty, but I could barely get through the tuna with a knife. It was ridiculously chewy and the texture was off. Now...dinner. I had the duck confit and he had the filet mignon. The duck was well prepared and it was a good quality meat. However... The sauce tasted like I had just swallowed a mouthful of salt. The sweet potato had a wonderful texture but lacked flavor. The cranberry chutney was pretty basic. This was the first time I have been out to a nice restaurant where there pretty much wasn't anything I liked. His filet was also well prepared but incredibly salty as well. Both items were taken back and made again, however it took forever both times and by when we got it back it was less salty. But still kind of sub par. Now....the service was pretty good and the manager and owner did try to make us happy. But overall I will not make the effort to try it again. This should have been a nice romantic out of town treat...but I had better food the next day at a little local joint.

I wanted to choose a special place to eat dinner so I browsed through Open Table and decide on CAV Restaurant. From the minute we walked through the door, we knew we were somewhere special. The decor was magical and whimsical. Our table was great and we were greeted by a welcoming waiter. The menu was diverse and creative. We loved our food and cocktails. The service was impeccable. I can't say enough about CAV. It has to be experienced to be believed. A+++
January 31, 2016|Hidden Gem|5|Very eclectic. Unique decor and amazing flavor! Great food combinations on the menu. Went for brunch with picky eaters and they were satisfied too.

January 30, 2016|Surprisingly slow|3|Extremely slow service on our Sat. Eve reservation for 4. Seemed a problem in the kitchen. The waiter was apologizing and pleasant and comped us extras which was very helpful. It was a bit crowded and noisy but nice atmosphere. Food was very good, although hard to appreciate with the continued waiting.

I had the seared salmon over roasted vegetables with a small green salad and it was very tasty. The Lobster Benedict provided a generous amount of lobster, the perfect serving of sauce and the bread (not English muffin) was nicely toasted and crispy.
January 23, 2016|Overall Visit|4|The food was excellent, seating was ok, facility's aroma was poor, service was ok, could of been more appetizers in one dish, was expecting 4 shrimp in one dish. Overall I'd rate CAV 3 1/2 stars out of 5.
January 3, 2016|Ok experience.|3|I was disappointed in the table we were placed at. We were a party of 6 and we were squeezed into a table built for 4 right in front of the bar. We were backed into another table for 4--very awkward. There were plenty of tables near the windows that remained empty during our stay so they could have easily accommodated us. Also, 3 guests ordered latte's. Waiter had to be reminded twice after serving regular coffee to other guests at table. When they finally arrived they were no longer warm. We did advise the waiter of this issue and we did not get charged. He seemed distracted because we had to also keep asking for more water. Perhaps they were understaffed for brunch that Sunday morning following New Years. Food was pretty good. Atmosphere great.
January 1, 2016|Need to check out this hidden gem!|4|My boyfriend and I ate here on New Year's Day evening. We found it slightly difficult to find, it is tucked away in an alley type road but were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. The decor is very artsy and romantic. Dim lights, chandeliers and very interesting artwork and sculptures tucked into wooden bookcases and surrounding shelving. We were seated on a raised platform which only had 2 tables on it, a very nice touch for the romantic time we were wanting. Our server, Jennifer, came over promptly and served us water and gave us ample time to decide on drinks. Their wine list by the glass was very reasonable priced and notable. My boyfriend chose the craft beer flight for $8, which was four 4oz. pours from their offering of tap beer. Served on a wooden board with a tasting card, it was a fun way to try new things. Menu is moderately priced and offers a bit of everything. French influence is apparent but not overbearing as to intimidate those who may not like French food. For an appetizer, my boyfriend chose the New England clam chowder. Thick, creamy, brimming with clams, but a bit too heavy on the onion flavor for my tastes. The crusty, fresh baked baguette bread with it was worth the wait. I chose the duck confit and grilled breast with blood orange compote for my entree. Confit was fall off the bone, served with a sweet potato mash, and a delicious sauce. The breast was served at proper temperature, sliced on a lovely blood orange warm compote. The skin on the breast was undercooked and unpleasant. It needed to be much crispier to be edible. The breast meat was tender and went well with the tart compote. My boyfriend had the wild mushroom risotto. It was a bowl filled with a wild mushroom ragout of sorts with a cone of risotto in the middle. The mushrooms were deliciously woody and chunky. The rice almost seemed to be a side dish for the mushrooms. Not what we expected but pleasantly surprised. No room for dessert, but would return.

December 27, 2015|Great meal in a warm atmosphere!|5|We had a great meal: fresh food and great service. The flavors are great. We had the calamari appetizer, the shrimp and cannelloni meal and a lamb dinner special.
December 24, 2015|Simply terrific|5|Everything about CAV is wonderful. Decor, ambiance, menu, service, FOOD!

It was a bit uncomfortable standing near door as we waited. We were seated about 15-20 minutes after our reservation time, but very much enjoyed our experience. In particular our server was excellent given the busy situation.
December 24, 2015|Disappointing Lunch|3|Used to dine at CAV regularly when I was in college. Loved the atmosphere, service, and the food. This visit I loved the atmosphere. While initially visible, the server was later absent from sight for long periods, including when I wanted to flag him down to let him know that the soup (lobster bisque) was barely warm. The Brie wpappetizer was fine, but the lemon risotto was just okay, missing the delicious flavor I remember from long ago. With so many excellent restaurants in the area, I'm very disappointed I chose CAV after visiting Trinity Rep.
December 23, 2015|Overpriced and forgettable.|2|Honetsly the wine mark up is extreme and the vegetarian food was boring and tasteless. This restaurant is pretty much riding on reputation.

Really liked the decor as it didn't have a particular theme but there was a cohesiveness to it that worked really well. Individual areas are kind of sectioned off by nothing more than differences in elevation or a small railing and a doorway with no walls. Very cool effect. The food was outstanding. I highly recommend the wild mushroom risotto. It was so earthy and fragrant that the taste stayed with me long after I left the restaurant. It was a very pleasant experience and the parking situation at night can't be beat. Huge free lot right across the street. I would definitely go back to CAV.
December 18, 2015|Excellent food but order only wine or beer.|4|Our party of four all agreed the food was excellent - I had sushi tuna dinner which was perfectly prepared with sauce to die for. The service was very good; the only gaff was that the waiter forgot to bring my coffee and brought the bill instead - very minor. Wine was excellent and a glass held plenty. Our only whine was that the mixed drinks were mostly ice and had little flavor. I would give CAV 4 stars rather than 5 because of the mixed drinks - no excuse for that. Overall we enjoyed the decor and ambiance, dinner and wine. Would definitely recommend it and we'll go back.
December 12, 2015|Holiday cheer at The CAV|5|We brought our foodie friends to The CAV to celebrate the holidays and we had a fantastic meal. We all cleaned our plates. The server was friendly and knowledgable. I would recommend The CAV anytime you're looking for a fun night with great food and drink!
December 11, 2015|This was amazing!|5|This was amazing!
December 11, 2015|Consistently awesome!|5|This is my 2nd time dining here with my wife, both times were amazing! This most recent time we started with the calamari (very fresh and perfectly cooked), and both of our meals were cooked and seasoned perfectly (Filet Mignon and Braised Lamb Shank). I will definitely be going back
December 11, 2015|Looking forward to our next visit!|5|Charming atmosphere, outstanding food and wonderful service. Varied menu and reasonably priced. Save room for dessert!
November 29, 2015|My son and I went to CAV for Sunday brun...|4|My son and I went to CAV for Sunday brunch around 11:30am. The restaurant was not crowded just yet, but we were waiting at the front entrance for about 4 minutes for a hostess to walk over and greet us. This was quite odd since again the restaurant was not crowded. (Most brunchers show up to CAV around 12:30pm) The only reason I did not give CAV 5 stars was the fact we had to wait for a while to be seated. Once we were seated our waiter was extremely friendly and attended to all of our needs with ease and swiftness. We had the coconut shrimp for an appetizer and it was yummy, just the perfect amount of coconut. For our main course I ordered the scrambled eggs with the Maine lobster and a side of bacon. All were scrumptious! My child ordered the Belgian waffle and raved about how great it tasted. The endless cups of coffee were wonderful as well. You cannot beat the ambiance as the decor makes for a wonderful conversation over your meal. Also, can't beat the free parking in the lot across the street! I cannot wait to go back to CAV and try other things in the menu!
November 28, 2015|Casual but refined dining in Providence|5|"Went to CAV last Saturday with my grown kids and their significant others and had a pleasant and enjoyable evening. At the same time ecletic, easy going and refined atmosphere as if at a ""fancy"" restaurant, but they do it right so that you feel you are at a local neighborhood eatery. Food is excellent and varied, with friendly, courteous and knowledgable waitstaff. We'll be going again!"
November 21, 2015|Amazing find in Providence|5|From the moment I was greeted from the maitre d' I knew I found a hidden gem in Providence. The ambiance is beatiful with funky crystal chandeliers and antique tin mirrors throughout. Service was 5 star along with our meals. We were there on a busy Saturday evening and service was flawless. We found our new special place!!

November 14, 2015|As Always!|5|"CAV never disappoints. When I asked ""Where should we go?"" I never hesitate to respond, ""Let's go to CAV."" The food and the service and the ambiance always combine to make any visit special."
November 13, 2015|Great Food and Unique Atmosphere!|4|"CAV has a unique decor that makes it cozy, warm, and elegant at the same time. Its red brick walls are decorated with unique antiques and pieces of art, and beautiful glass chandeliers hang from the ceiling. The space is very comfortable and conducive to conversation. Now on to the food. Enjoyed a wonderful poached lobster appetizer and a delicious ravioli stuffed with broccolini in black truffle oil and topped with shavings of sweet turnip. It was a great combination of flavors! My only complaint is that the portion for the ravioli was a bit large for a ""fine dining"" experience. That being said, I still ate the whole thing because it was so delicious. Nevertheless I felt stuffed afterwards and couldn't enjoy what seemed like marvelous desserts."
November 13, 2015|CAV experience!|5|My husband and I enjoyed our evening at the CAV restaurant. Our food was excellent, the atmosphere was enchanting, and the staff was very welcoming. We will definitely return and recommend this rare find to our friends.
November 12, 2015|A little deception...|3|"I had made a reservation on Open table for a 1000 point timeframe. My friends arrived before me, and the host claimed he did not have the reservation. When I arrived, I showed it to him on my phone - his response was ""oh, I did see that"". Also, the restaurant offers a prix fixe menu on the night we were there. They did not offer the menu - had to ask for it. The food was good and ambiance great, but these two incidents make me reluctant to return. There are plenty of other restaurants that are much more customer friendly."

November 7, 2015|Wonderful as always|4|We took a group of five friends this past Saturday evening. It was the busiest I've ever seen it, but our table was ready. The food was awesome and the service met our expectations. CAV has a very special atmosphere that is better experienced than described. Dine at CAV, you won't regret it.
November 7, 2015|Cool place to go for dinner|4|This was definitely a cool place to go for dinner. The ambiance was eclectic and different. We had a reservation, and were seated right away. The host even pulled out my chair (I love when they do that). The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us a ton of information to mull over. I decided to try their scallop dish with lemon risotto, and my boyfriend had their Sautéed Lobster meat over fresh-cut Pappardelle. We are new to New England, and are not used to ordering fresh seafood in restaurants. As we embrace New England we have been trying to order seafood dishes to ease our way in whenever we're confident it will be of high quality. We both enjoyed our dishes very much. I'd love to go back and try their chicken! In addition, they had a substantive wine list, and my boyfriend ordered a very good old fashioned. The tiramisu was delicious as well. For the two of us, we were just under $120 with a healthy tip. The patio looked really nice too, though it was too cold for us to sit out there.

November 1, 2015|Birthday Brunch|5|We had a group of eight, three generations, two birthdays to celebrate. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Many of us had a hard time choosing what to order because of the wonderful offerings. Our vegan had only one menu item open to him; he said it was very good. Perhaps one additional vegan offering would be appreciated. In any case, all of the food was delicious, we were not rushed, and everyone enjoyed the time together over a nice meal.
October 31, 2015|Fanstic Dining Experience at the CAV|5|This restaurant is elegant, unique and the menu is exceptional. The waiters are extremely personable and very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine selection. The Filet Mignon dinner is out of this world. My husband and I have been back 3 weeks in a row for dinner. All in all a fantastic dining experience. I highly recommend the CAV for any occasion.
October 31, 2015|Outstanding dining experience!|5|Highly recommend this establishment for a casual lunch or celebratory dinner. From the mouth watering appetizers to the unique entree specials and the extensive menu of staples, the most fussy eater will be easily satisfied. One would not want to rush their meal in order to take a peek at all of the unusual pieces of art and antiques that adorn the entire restaurant - which truly makes this dining experience outstanding!!
October 30, 2015|"""hidden away from downtown"""|5|Fabulous, magnificently presented and most exquisite dining for New England. The lamb shank was very tender & juicy. The Sophia Salad for 2 was a generous portion, enough for 3 to 4! We didn't have to wait, the wait staff guided us to an area above the main floor and gave us a choice of tables which made us feel as though we were 'royalty'. Elegant, yet rustic atmosphere which made us feel as though we were in the middle of Europe........without leaving New England. The service was just ideal and again, the food was extraordinary.

October 24, 2015|Dinner was delicious|5|The duck was wonderful, wines and cocktails were great and the service was good. A little noisy but in a pleasant way.
October 24, 2015|great place to go with friends|5|We have been to the CAV many times and continue to enjoy the atmosphere and food. We have recommended it to many of our friends. Sylvia is a wonderful inspiration to all who go there!
October 23, 2015|Great as always|5|CAV has been consistently good for years, and our most recent visit was no exception. Food was excellent, specialty cocktails were tasty and interesting, and the ambiance at CAV is a great combination of cozy/romantic/artsy/fun.

October 21, 2015|A Celebration|4|My wife and I shared the Bruschetta and it was delicious and just enough for the two of us. My wife ordered the Scallop and Shrimp dish and found it to me too salty to eat. The waiter graciously replaced the entrée with a less salty version. I selected the swordfish special. I also found it to be more salty than I would have liked, but I did not send it back. We both felt that the portion size was perfect for us. We are looking forward to trying Brunch!

October 18, 2015|Just ok for a Sunday brunch!|3|We dined there on Sunday 10/21 at 10:30 am as a party of 6. Very noisy and crowded, slow food service as a result. Restaurant staff very attentive overall, given how busy the restaurant was. Restaurant cancelled via email our OpenTable reservation the night before without explanation and I had to call the next morning before arriving to get us reinstated (kudos to staff member, Jason, for doing so!). Manager at the hostess desk was not very pleasant overall to deal with when we first checked in and did not follow-up as promised to reinstate the OT dining points; I had to follow-up directly with OT to resolve this problem, which was done promptly and seamlessly. Meal portions were good-sized except for the salmon salad--the salmon, while cooked perfectly and delicious, was disappointingly tiny in size.

October 16, 2015|Best of Providence|5|The Cav is fantastic. The service was phenomenal. The food was outstanding. And the decor was SO Cool. There management was great, too. We had reservations for 7:15, and were stuck in traffic. A quick phone call and they were able to seat us at 8:00. This has become my favorite restaurant in Providence, and there are so many great ones in that city, too...
October 10, 2015|This place gets everything just right|5|I'm not sure how long this place has been around, but I wish I had known about it sooner. Everything about the dinner was just about perfect, from the interesting decor (mostly African statuary and old crystal chandeliers) to the nonsense-free but extremely attentive service, to the delicious and artfully plated food itself. And to top it off, quite reasonably priced. A very very satisfying experience.
October 8, 2015|Lovely birthday evening....|4|I surprised my spouse with dinner here, for his birthday, having driven up from Newport. We ordered from the prix fixe menu, which was well priced: he had steak tips with roasted vegetables and I tilapia with a stunning red onion jam. Both were perfectly cooked, although his beef proved to be a little tough. Accompanying salads before and raspberry sorbet (I think it was actually sherbet) after were tasty but small and uninspired. We both loved the outlandish and eclectic decor, and the restaurant's tucked-away, almost secret location delighted us on this first visit. Loved the free parking, too. The service was excellent. I would order a la carte next time. Strangely, the only reservation available was at 6pm, far earlier than I'd hoped, but there were many tables available throughout our dinner hour (on a mid-October Thursday). The service was so swift (though not at all rushed) that we were back in the car by seven. We left a little chagrined that we hadn't drawn out the evening longer.
October 3, 2015|Top notch service|4|Top notch service
October 3, 2015|Not your typical dinner, eclectic & fun|5|From our first foot in the door till we left, we had great customer service. The atmosphere is so different, due to their eclectic antique decor. We had lobster bisque - sweet & savory served piping hot & delicious, lamb shank, fall off the bone goodness, seared scallops with lemon risotto, every bite was heaven. Our server was great and all the staff worked well together. Highly recommend!
October 3, 2015|Not a experience|2|We picked CAV because it seemed like the perfect place for a raw and chilly night. And it was. The martinis were great, wine was good, but when it came to the food, so-so is about all I can say. The vegetables might have been good if they were warm. But they weren't. The crackers with the brie appentizer looked like they were just taken from a box and put on the plate without care. The meat was very fatty and while I realize that adds flavor, there was a lot and finding the actual meat was a challenge. That said, it was tasty, but lukewarm. It would be hardto recommend the restaurant.
September 26, 2015|Little hidden gem.|5|This restaurant is tucked away in what looks like an old mill building. The interior has a great ambiance and soft candle lighting. Very romantic and cozy. There are a lot of antiques and various light fixtures which give this restaurant an old world vibe. My husband and I went there on his birthday for a romantic evening and it did not disappoint. Our waiter was also very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.
Dined on September 26, 2015|Nice Find|5|This was our first time in Providence and it was hard to decide where to eat because of the many interesting choices. We chose CAV based on the menu choices. We ended up changing our reservation time a few times and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. We weren't sure at first that our navigation took us to the right location because the restaurant is in a more industrial area than we expected. Turned out to be the diamond district of Providence. The courtyard made a nice entrance to the antique store/restaurant. The back drop of the antiques in the place made it an atmosphere that was totally surprising and eclectic. Our waiter was very attentive, engaging and respectful. He told us the story behind the restaurant and made every item on the menu sound divine. The food was amazing. From the lobster bisque, crab cakes and hand fried calamari to the filet mignon, scallops, and mushroom risotto to the desserts with wonderfully made latte's. We will definitely return.
September 20, 2015|Food, service and atmosphere were a delight!|5|Dined on Sunday prior to a show at the PPAC. The greeting was warm and fun that we received from the host. The service was prompt and attentive to getting us to the theatre on time. The wait staff were wonderful and engaging without being intrusive and the food was presented in a fabulous manner and was delicious! We share Tiramasu and a Berry Torte for dessert, both delicious! An overall wonderful dining experience and yes, we will be back!!!

September 19, 2015|Great!|4|The 3 of us came here for dinner on a Saturday evening. First time for all of us. Service was excellent and the decor was just outstanding. Reminded us of our Parisian vacations. For the most part, food was really good. My husband had the special, and our friend had the scallops and shrimp dish. Both men really enjoyed their entrees. Mine was just okay. After reading all the reviews about their lobster and pasta, I was looking forward to trying that out. Unfortunately I didn't think it was that great because of the over abundance of cream sauce in the dish. It really ruined the pasta itself because I couldn't taste the actual pasta. Oh well. Our overall experience was still great.
September 15, 2015|Amazing as always|5|I highly recommend the duck!!! It's just one of those dishes that if it's done right it's incredible and if not.... CAV ALWAYS gets it right! We went for a celebration dinner this time. Consistently excellent.
September 10, 2015|Always good food. Good atmosphere|5|Always good food. Good atmosphere

September 4, 2015|Duck was great!|5|Duck was great!
August 30, 2015|Too hot|1|The restaurant was uncomfortably warm. Air conditioning must be outdated. We got up and left without ordering.
August 28, 2015|Great Service & Decor|4|Amazing service. Our server never let anything go low on the table. He was also very funny and friendly to us with a few good recommendations from the menu. The decor is very unique and interesting but very tasteful. The food was all hot and well prepared.
August 22, 2015|Excellent|5|Been here 4 other times and all have been exceptional.Last night was the first time I had a small problem.The food was fantastic up until my tuna. Advertised as sushi grade and up until the last slice it was,the last slice was so full of silver skin veins it was inedible. Still one of the best restaurants around. The service is impeccable and Jennifer was outstanding. Not enough to prevent me from returning. Really enjoy it here,hope this was just an off night
August 21, 2015|Always A Crowd Pleaser|5|We have dined at CAVs for the past seven years and have always been pleased. Whether for business or pleasure it has always been a hit with participants. Great wait staff and ambiance.
August 16, 2015|What a great find!|5|One of my clients recommended CAV for brunch and although I have had numerous great dining experiences in Providence this was definitely one of the best. Tucked away in a great neighborhood with an incredibly unique atmosphere, CAV's food turned out to top the ambience. We couldn't decide on what to order because everything looked so delicious....and it was. Will for sure be back and will pass along my outstanding experience to others without a doubt!
August 15, 2015|Exquisite|5|Back for the third time on our annual girls weekend, this place keeps getting better and better. The food is superb. The atmosphere is to die for. The wine list is excellent with a mix of affordable and splurge bottles. We never have room for dessert because the food is just so good. Wish we lived closer because we would certainly be regulars! Just realized they did brunch, will probably go back twice next year! Cheers!
August 1, 2015|Just another great meal.|5|"Service was very good....attentive, but not intrusive. The wild mushroom crostini appetizer was excellent and generous for 2. My shrimp and cavatelli was savory and very good. My girlfriend's lobster pappardelle was phenomenal. Come hungry...like the appetizer, portions were not tiny. If you have your heart set on dessert, you may want to skip the starter or split a ""for one"" portion."
July 25, 2015|A Nice Surprise!|4|First visit to Providence and found this gem! Unique space where you can eat, drink and even buy the decor. How cool is that. Very good food and service!!
July 25, 2015|Really Cool Place and good food|5|Went to brunch at CAV. The food was great. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals. The interior has some really cool decorations and antiques. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and will be returning sometime soon to try their dinner menu.

July 22, 2015|Amazing food!!!!|5|great food!!! very nice owner as well. The sweet pea ravioli's were very tasty with a mushroom/sage sauce. The Halibut was done perfectly.
July 22, 2015|Consistently good|5|When I first went to CAV years ago, I wasn't crazy about it, but it is now one of my favorite restaurants in Providence. The menu is varied enough for groups, and the food and service are excellent. It's terrific for lunch or a special night out.
July 21, 2015|It was good...|4|The waiter was excellent. The space is very nice the food was okay....i felt like the food was trying to hard if that makes sense. It felt like I had way to many thjngs going on in the dish. It was good you could tell the chef put a lot of effort into the meal. But it just didn't wow me for the price of the meal.
July 19, 2015|Where was my reservation?|4|They didnt have our reservation when we arrived, but were able to accomidate us. Not sure what happened there.
July 18, 2015|An old favorite|5|I have been here at least 20 times over the years. Need I say more?

May 29, 2015|Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!|5|Always a delight to dine at CAV. we enjoyed every bite of the sesame encrusted tuna and Filet Mignon. The flour-less chocolate cake was to die for as was the fruit tart. If champagne it right for the evening get a bottle of Imperial Peche it's wonderful! Our server Jen was very prompt and just delightful! Can't wait to return! Only down side, we were not checked in when we arrived and came home to a cancellation notice of our reservation. We had to contact open table to get our points. Make sure you get checked in when you arrive...
May 28, 2015|Wonderful lunch...|5|It was our first visit. Took an out of town guest there for lunch and it was a lovely setting for a great lunch. The restuarant is beautiful and the choices were varied and delicious. The staff was great too. Wil return for sure.
May 26, 2015|A Favorite|5|CAV is one of our favorite places to go out with other couples. The ambience is fun, the noise level reasonable, the food excellent, and the price appropriate (we usually spend about $50/pp). We are vegetarians who eat fish, and we always find something good. We recently had the mushroom risotto, which was deconstructed and very tasty, and the swordfish special, which was also excellent. The house wines are good as well.
May 24, 2015|Unique but some dishes have very small portions|4|Our butterfly shrimp appitizer had only 2 shrimps, not a large dinner selection but they do have good wines.
May 16, 2015|Simply wonderful!|5|We've dined at CAV frequently for many years. They are always amazing. I have to say that this past Saturday night I've NEVER ever seen it as busy as it was. It was the place to go for graduation dinner celebrations. After seeing the crowd- I thought gee, better settle in for slow service because there's no way they can possibly make this happen. Well, I am very HAPPY to report that the service was as fabulous as it was on the evening of one of the famous New England Blizzards when we were practically one of the only tables in the place. We all enjoyed our dinner- pasta florentine, cavatelli and salmon respectively, and the service was just excellent. Way to go TEAM CAV. My sister visiting from out of town was blown away.
May 16, 2015|Not impressed|4|I was not impressed with the quality of the food. The shrimp appetizer is the same that I get from bj's., it's deep fried. Being a French restaurant I guess I expected more. The service was great.
May 15, 2015|We were overall very pleased with our ex...|4|We were overall very pleased with our experience. We had had the coconut shrimp and crab cake for a starter. They were both very good. We tried the duck and the scallops for dinner. The scallops were huge and delicious! Although unfortunately served barely warm. The lemon risotto with it was somewhat bland. My boyfriend let me try the duck and the sauce and flavor were amazing! The waiter was nice enough to let me try a taste of the lobster bisque because I was unsure about the vanilla in it. Never saw a manager anywhere which I thought was strange. The service was excellent. We will be back.
May 10, 2015|Dine and shop at Cav|5|Cav is an eclectic restaurant experience where the decorations are literally art from around the world which you may buy right off the walls or shelves if you choose. The food is inspired by the travel of the owners from destinations as eclectic as the artworks. Cav is translated into cave which is not the feeling that you get. Think of a sunken living room with art and friends who enjoy each others company. The crowd is diverse and fun loving as well as open to new experiences in dining.
May 10, 2015|Need to give them another chance.|2|My napkin smelled like it sat too long in the washer machine. Our soups were tasty but they were cold when he brought them to us. The staff were definetely overwhelmed.
May 3, 2015|Pleasant Surprise|5|The interior of the restaurant makes it a pleasant visit but the food on the menu makes it a place worth staying. Great seafood and pasta dishes as well as an excellent alcohol menu. Great ambiance and service and perfect for a date or just an evening out. Although I made a reservation through open table and i received a confirmation e-mail, when called to double check the staff could not find my reservation so I had to make one over the phone. I do not know if this was a Cav issue or an opentable issue but if you are going to make a reservation on opentable i suggest you call to double check.
April 25, 2015|The restaurant is tucked back in the cor...|4|The restaurant is tucked back in the corner and we almost missed it. Once we found it, we noticed a beautiful courtyard where you could fine when the weather is nicer. Walking in and seeing the ambiance was a nice surprise. It had a very Nordic almost tribal decor but it felt like a cute antique shop. The staff was amazing and very attentive. We went for brunch and let me start off saying that I studied the menu before going and I knew I was going to order the French toast a la CAV. And it was delicious. I loved the restaurant and would like to try it for dinner. I went with my friend, but for brunch I would have no problem bringing my 4yr old daughter, seemed friendly family.
April 19, 2015|Quaint atmosphere and delicious food!|4|It's off the beaten path and not all that easy to find, but once you are seated, you don't worry about how you got there. The restaurant is quiet, filled with a beautiful decor of antiques. The food was excellent! It is rare for me to leave a restaurant without taking some of the leftovers home with me, but I ate every bite of the delicious fresh cut pasta stuffed with spinach and cheese. My husband ordered the scallops, which were perfectly seared. We enjoyed a leisurely meal and never felt rushed. It was a nice evening out for an excellent meal.
April 17, 2015|Dining Out|5|One of my favorite restaurants. Have eaten at Cav for brunch, lunch and dinner. The food, service and setting is fabulous.
April 17, 2015|Group of seven|5|my group of artists, poets, writers has been getting together once a month for over a decade. We usually meet at a member's home for dinner. One of us has too small a space for such a gathering so last year we chose to meet at the CAV for lunch. It was such a success members requested this again for this year. The best part was Sylvia's visit to our table. in fact, that was our desert!

Dined on April 15, 2015|Always a Pleasure|5|CAV offers the ambiance, food, wine list, & desserts to satisfy the most finicky eaters. Our evening began outside where we each enjoyed a glass of wine, then moved inside where we dined surrounded by unique pieces of art and antiques. Our entrees - off the menu and specials - a combination of salads, seafood and pasta - all arrived hot. The delicious meals were topped off with a creme brule, cappucino, and expresso and everyone ordered a chocolate chip cookies to take home. A great dining experience!!
April 9, 2015|The Good and Bad|3|"I always liked the Cav. Everything was great except their special dinner offering, swordfish. It looked like a petite lunch item. thin and small. On top of that it was over cooked and two people at our table who ordered it wondered why it was the Cav's ""Special"" It was also served on top of a Pea Rice, which was tasteless. Not good for this place.."
April 5, 2015|Never a disappointment!|5|It was a busy morning - Easter morning - but the food was still perfectly cook and presented and the mamosas were delicious! We are never disappointed by the CAV!
April 5, 2015|excellent brunch----great service|5|Party of 5 for Easter brunch and seated at round table in back of bar----very quiet and no people traffic. Selections were great and everyone enjoyed the experience. We have also been there for dinner and always impressed with the options and service
April 5, 2015|Great Easter Brunch|4|Loved the CAV for Easter Brunch. Diverse interesting menu and the food and service were very good.
April 4, 2015|Amazing|5|I have always had the best experience at cav! The food is always delicious and the service on point. I am always happy to recommend this place, especially for brunch on the weekends!
March 28, 2015|Always great, one of my favorites|5|Always great, one of my favorites
March 21, 2015|First of MANY visits, for sure!!!|5|My first visit to CAV was amazing! From the warm welcome to the excellent service and meal, it truly was a great dining experience. The eclectic décor with skillfully chosen pieces was mesmerizing; with something different/new noticed often during the evening. If one is fortunate enough to have Vinnie as the 'third member' of your party, be prepared for the best service ever and the feeling that you're the only table in the room! CAV could very easily be compared to better dining experiences in New York City and Boston. I eagerly look forward to my next visit.
March 21, 2015|Very Unique dining experience with excellent food.|5|I have never experienced had a dining atmosphere like this, the restaurant itself is a conversation piece. The food was excellent and the creme brulee was perfect. Very Enjoyable
March 13, 2015|Amazing dinner with perfect ambience!|5|The scallops and shrimp were the best I've ever tasted! The presentation of the food, ambience and service were also excellent. Highly recommended!!
March 13, 2015|a hidden gem|4|Cav is tucked away in a quiet area of the city, near the Brown U medical center, but not far from downtown either. It has the added benefit of plentiful street parking and a lot across the street. The ambiance is shabby chic, though a cooler version of it. We went for lunch and had delectable calamari that was only partially breaded and not at all chewy. My son had a huge turkey and brie sandwich that came with a small side salad and I had a lemon artichoke risotto. Both were incredible. Service was stressed when we went on a Friday at 1pm - the place was full and though we were seated promptly, it was quite a while before we were greeted at our table and asked for drink orders. By the time that happened, we had already finished deciding on our order, so decided to place our entire order as we were not sure our server would be back anytime soon. We did mention we had a one hour limit and to his credit, the server did get us out in under an hour. I think they were short a server or two IMO.
March 11, 2015|Unique ambiance, food was very good. But...|4|Unique ambiance, food was very good. But as we entered there was no greater.

February 20, 2015|The service was impeccable... It was the...|5|"The service was impeccable... It was the first time, I had taken my boyfriend there and his exact words were ""Why haven't you brought me here before? We definitely need to come back"". He raved about the food and the ambiance. Now my favorite spot has turned into his favorite spot."
February 20, 2015|Nice dinner|4|My wife and I met a friend for dinner and the three of us had a delicious dinner. The calamari was one of the best we have ever had. Main courses were excellent and even the desserts were tasty. With wine, an appetizer three main courses and dessert, the bill came to about 50.00 per person. The service was outstanding and it was not too noisy the night we were there
February 13, 2015|three wins in a row|5|This was our third visit and cav never disappoints. We started with the chive dumplings - fantastic! and the goat cheese croquettes. They were so good but there wasn't enough of them! It was almost a tease, but I know there could never be enough! For dinner we ordered the lamb shank which was so tender you didn't need your knife and the diver scallops which may have been the best scallops I've ever eaten! If you haven't been to CAV, what are you waiting for? Oh one more comment. It is noisy, but you can still hear the people at your table and you don't have to shout.
February 13, 2015|Parent's weekend 2015|5|We had a wonderful dinner when we came up for parent's weekend. The food was wonderful and the filet cooked perfectly. My cocktail was great and the wine was spot on.
February 13, 2015|Date night|4|Lovely meal. Dreadfully slow service. Inattentive. Would have loved a second glass of wine but server was no where to be found. After we placed order it took 50 minutes for our salads to arrive. food was prepared beautifully and tasty!
February 10, 2015|Great Space, Poor Service|1|We went there for my mothers birthday celebration. My sister, who lives in another state, had called earlier in the day to have a bottle of wine sent the table. After we had been seated for quite some time, the waiter took drink orders (including a bottle of wine) and walked away. It wasn't until I walked away from the table and up to the waiter to inform him of the previously purchased bottle of wine, to which she had no knowledge. Service was extremely slow and we were only one of about 10 tables in there. While I love this restaurant, it was a truly disappointing experience.
February 8, 2015|Fabulous brunch!|5|Our daughter is in school in Providence and thus we have sampled many restaurants in the area. This was by far one of the best experiences of all time. Brunch was phenomenal the atmosphere was amazing. I cannot wait to come back to try dinner sometime
February 7, 2015|Consistently wonderful|5|Thanks to Sylvia and everyone at CAV for a consistently wonderful dining experience that, for us, has spanned many years. I had to request some modifications for diet reasons and the wait staff/kitchen were very accommodating and did a nice job.
January 24, 2015|Delicious meal!|4|The four of us were all very happy with our dishes - they were all very well seasoned and the menu has options covering a wide array of palates, making it easy to find something everyone would like. Atmosphere is cozy and relaxed while still getting top quality, beautifully prepared food. Would absolutely recommend!
January 23, 2015|1/23/15|2|"I had the mis-fortune to have lunch at CAV during restaurant week.I should have been leery of my choice as there was a very limited menu. The three course menu consisted of a green salad (that barely fit the small plate) one of three entrees ( I chose the burger which arrived isolated on a bun with a handful of fries) and a scope of sorbet for dessert. For the price I could have done better ordering from the menu. My wife did better with the fish tacos. I will now be cautious of ""restaurant week"" specials. Instead of being a vehicle to show culinary talents it seems to be a way to package cheap,basic items. CAV is better than this."
January 17, 2015|Just|3|Disappointed by the food. Wasn't bad but rather bland (not subtle ..bland) . Scallops were flavorless and risotto side dish was mushy. The lobster bisque was interesting with a touch of vanilla. The gentlemen greeting was rather aloof ( not french aloof but disengaged). My husband was intrigued by the decor so will probably return to try brunch. The price does not suit the food so very unlikely we will return for an evening meal.
January 17, 2015|Warm and wonderful|5|Not only is the food at CAV great, but there is a warmth to the atmosphere that makes it a wonderful place to spend an evening. The staff and owners are friendly and welcoming. We had a lovely evening and will definitely come again.
January 9, 2015|Great hidden gem!|5|We've started frequenting the Cav in the past two months. We went on a whim back in December (though we had both been there before, it had been about 10 years) and was reminded what an amazing place this is! It's absolutely BEAUTIFUL and the service is SO WONDERFUL. And the food is so so so SOOOO GOOD! The ONLY reason I didn't give the food a full 5 stars is because we're vegetarians and while the 2-3 options on the menu are stellar, sometimes I wish there were a few more options for us. But we still go every few weeks, once we even went twice in one weekend. I love that it's usually pretty quiet and not overrun with people and long waits. I love the online reservations through Open Table. This is a great place!
December 29, 2014|Great new find!|4|Loved the ambiance. Drinks were top notch. Service was impeccable. Food was excellent.
December 26, 2014|The main course fell short|2|Very nice eclectic restaurant, which my wive enjoyed very much. Excellent sangria, Everything went well until I got my main course, rack of lamb. I eat a lot of lamb and found this one a little gamey and tough.,,,not enough to send back, but not enjoyable. The polenta was pretty much cold and the gravy served with the lamb was so over salted I didn't dare mix it with the polenta or lamb. My wife liked her shrimp and scallops. For one of the higher priced restaurants in the area, missing the sauce by that much ruined the whole meal. I won't give it a second chance.
December 24, 2014|Christmas eve dinner|4|Our evening was lovely, we had excellent service from our waiter Vinnie and also the support staff. The owner was a delight and when she found out we were given the wrong table (another couple had reserved) she politely asked us to move and for our 'trouble' gave us a drink on the house and an appetizer. All of the dishes that we ordered were delicious and we would heartily recommend the food and the fun atmosphere.
December 20, 2014|always a pleasure|5|We have been to come several times, and the food and service I've always been superb. Even though it's a little bit out-of-the-way, it is well worth the trip. It is and eclectic environment, comfortable, familiar. And the food is without a doubt some of the best you will find in Providence.
December 16, 2014|This is a gem|4|The whole experience was spot on. The service, the food and the reasonable prices will bring us back to cav. Very enjoyable evening.
December 15, 2014|celebrating|2|starter: calamari was a little bit overcooked. parmesan crusted chicken was good. bacon wrapped filet mignon was overcooked then what we ordered was medium got well done. the taste of layers of seasoning and flavors in the food was not up to par which my partner agrees 20th times prior was satisfyingly good. wish they change up the menu for more selection
December 13, 2014|This is an exceptional spot for special occasions!|5|The wait staff was perfect - not too solicitous but present and attentive. The food was extraordinary and the unusual decor makes this a great place to spend an evening enjoying a luxurious dinner.
December 10, 2014|Excellent food and service!|5|My husband and I celebrated 25 years and chose CAV as our place to be. We've been here several times and every time is wonderfully memorable. Fillet mignon was excellent, waitress very attentive, atmosphere relaxing and romantic. Will definitely return again soon.
November 26, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|I was in Providence for Thanksgiving with family. My wife, daughter and two young granddaughters went to CAV for lunch. It was such a great lunch we decided to come back the next evening for dinner. Again fantastic meal. The service was probably the best I have encountered.
November 24, 2014|My wife and I came here for our second w...|5|My wife and I came here for our second wedding anniversary which was also our first night out alone after our son was born. Everything was perfect, our waiter, the food, the drinks. Thank you for such a great night out!
November 18, 2014|Been awhile...|5|CAV has been around for years and the meal we had is proof of why that is. The space is beautifully decorated in such a way that it feels cozy even with the high, open ceilings. Our waiter was attentive, but in a subtle way and the food was simply outstanding. I am wondering why it has been so long since I last visited and will now make it a point to return more often.
November 14, 2014|Great little gem!|5|We came for dinner on Friday then unexpectedly were invited to return for brunch on Sunday so we experienced both dinner and brunch on the same weekend! Both were fantastic. Friday night was a very romantic and cozy dinner with excellent food and service. We are vegetarians and while there weren't a ton of vegetarian options, there were a handful of really good choices - we both loved our meals! Brunch was also delicious! The ambience is magical - cozy, warm, beautiful antiques everywhere you look! I loved it! It was a little pricey, though, so it's not a place I feel we could go very often, but it will definitely be my first choice when we can splurge a bit on a nice dinner.
November 9, 2014|Great Lil Hidden Spot|5|We almost didn't see the place but once inside you'll see the quirky decor and think hmmmmmmmmm. Lol. But the food was amazing. Absolutely loved everything that hit our table.
November 8, 2014|Awesome atmosphere!|5|We recently dined here for a romantic birthday celebration!! The food was fabulous from the appetizer to the entrees. The decor is sparkling and eclectic with crystal chandeliers and art covering the walls. This is definitely one of the most unique restaurants in Providence. The service was wonderful and we will definitely be returning! Thanks for a great night!!!
Dined on November 8, 2014|Menu Limited|4|The menu is limited and has not changed. The CAV needs to expand on its dinner selections. Service is excellent. Great Ambiance.
November 8, 2014|France in Providence!|5|Having thoroughly experienced Italian cuisine in Providence, I tried CAV for a change of pace, and was very impressed. The quality of food preparation was excellent - I was cautioned by the waiter that the lobster bisque is sweet, but I found it very tasty. The filet mignon was superb, as was the lamb. The wine list was interesting, and had many offerings at reasonable prices. A little out of the way, but a great find.
November 4, 2014|Rovingpineapple|5|One of our favorite restaurants in Providence. Always excellent. Great food. Excellent service. And eclectic atmosphere which always intrigues first time guests. Their tuna entrée is one of my favorite all-time dishes.
November 1, 2014|5 Stars - Highly Recommend!!|5|I choose CAV restaurant after searching for top restaurants in Providence for a night out and let me tell you CAV did not disappoint! This place had everything: eclectic boho ambiance, crazy good french inspired cuisine, delicious wine, and friendly down to earth service. I don't usually write reviews but this place deserves some praise. Highly recommend!!
November 1, 2014|Creative food and surroundings:A+|5|Another wonderful evening at CAV. Our server was warm, professional and sophisticated in his knowledge of the food and wines. The meals each had a unique and delicious twist that brought surprise and enjoyment. This setting with the whimsical lighting, gorgeous African art and sculpture, and rich kilims under the glass tabletops give a cozy and warm style to the atmosphere. The varied areas and levels in the dining space allow for intimate dinners for two, larger groups, and a private room for parties. I've enjoyed all of these on various occasions. Easily a favorite!
October 26, 2014|eclectic|4|I chose this restaurant based on the reviews I read on TripAdvisor. Eclectic restaurant...I like eclectic. The atmosphere of the restaurant made dining very interesting. And the food was good.
October 25, 2014|New favorite rest. in Providence RI|5|Just excellent: food service and environment. We found CAV funky, warm and fun. With many great choices in Providence...this is a winner.
October 22, 2014|Thoroughly enjoyed|5|The quality of the food and presentation were excellent.
October 19, 2014|Great brunch|5|Took the in-laws from out of state here for brunch, they were amazed by the decor and loved the food. I had been for dinner before and loved it but never brunch, brunch was just as delicious as dinner and I can't wait to go back! Great service too.
October 10, 2014|Service and food top-notch|5|My husband and I had a lovely time dining at CAV. The warm French bread with real butter made for a great start. We shared the calamari appetizer and that was so tasty. It's baked with peppers and garlic. For the entree we had the duck and the scallop. The scallops were prob the best I've ever had and I have eaten lots of scallops. Cooked to perfection with risotto and green beans. I couldn't have wished for a better plate. The hubby loved the duck as well. We finished the night with some tiramisu and it tasted very fresh and delicious. Our server was excellent and made great recommendations.
October 3, 2014|Excellent|5|Ended up neading a restaurant with later hours as a flight delay pushed off our original plans What a find! Food and service were spectacular. Definitely going back.
October 3, 2014|Overall pretty good|3|Love the way this restaurant is decorated. It's different and unique. The one complaint I would have is that my meal and two other people I was with were a little cold. I had a chef special which was okay. Next time I will choose differently.
September 22, 2014|I L O V E   CAV!!|5|If I could give an extra star I would. This restaurant is phenomenal and the ambiance is beyond compare. I always bring my out of town guests here to show off!! But I come with local friends, as well. Long live CAV :-)
September 20, 2014|Loved the CAV!|4|This restaurant is totally unique. It is both an antiques shop and a restaurant, serving a varied menu of French and American cuisine. The owner came over to our table and greeted us almost immediately upon being seated. She invited us to a 25th anniversary party of the restaurant, and then gave us an art appreciation lesson for the artworks that surrounded our table. The food was very good, but to be honest, I was so taken with the ambiance that the food took a back seat. The restaurant is tucked away and is a little hard to find. There is ample free parking and a lovely outdoor patio. I highly recommend a visit to CAV!
September 20, 2014|Great Dinner|4|All three of us in our party had a great meal. We'll definitely be back.
September 19, 2014|Friendly|5|The entire staff is friendly. The owner makes a special effort to at least acknowledge all of her guests. If you have been more than once she remembers you and always greets you with a friendly hello. Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing.
September 19, 2014|Sweet Serendipity|5|Along the road less traveled in Providence there's a treasure quietly tucked away where you will least expect it. A majestic old factory turned gallery filled with antiques, artwork and chandeliers in a romantic and magical setting. Where we enjoyed a romantic evening beginning with a delightful meal followed by waterfire and a nightcap. CAV was the perfect beginning to our evening with a great wine list, expertly crafted cocktails, wonderful food and impeccable service. We enjoyed the walnut encrusted Brie, Sophia salad, Shrimp & Sautéed White Bean Ragout and it was capped by the queen of all desserts; a Creme Brulee' made with Tahitian Vanilla. It just doesn't get any better than this!
September 17, 2014|For 25 years CAV excells|5|We just love CAV. We recently took friends who are locals and they had never been there. Shows how hidden this gem is. Our waiter was good but had too many tables, but we had come to talk it was OK. The food was the star and did not disappoint. The scallops and shrimp was one of the best scallops dishes I've EVER had ... perfectly cooked and the plate was lovely. CAV does not overcharge for a bottle of wine. A bottle of excellent malbec was less than the cost of three glasses. Entering is like walking into an ethnic antique store ... African masks on the walls, oriental carpets everywhere and exposed brick and beams. And you can buy most of the art and furnishings which are for sale. We'll be back.
September 14, 2014|Not what I expected.|2|I made a reservation for brunch because the reviews were good. We were disappointed. My poached eggs were hard and, with the scant amount of hollandaise sauce, my breakfast was very dry. The bacon was like leather. The potatoes were good. French toast looked nice until we saw that the slices of bread included the end of the loaf. I would never serve that to a guest. The atmosphere, outdoor patio and service were all very good, but food is what would bring us back and I don't think that we will be.
September 14, 2014|Great food, terrible service|3|I am glad that I had read the reviews on this place about how good the food was. The service was terrible! However, I had one of the best brunch meals.
September 13, 2014|Wonderful Birthday Celebration|5|We had a group of 9 and it was wonderful. There were 4 vegetarians in our group and there were excellent choices for them. I had the scallops and shrimp with snow peas and lemon risotto which was fabulous. The baked brie is always a favorite and the chiogga beets were heavenly. Love this place.
September 10, 2014|Wonderful evening|5|On our second visit to the CAV, we took a couple of foodies from North Carolina. They loved it! We did, too. We enjoyed a late reservation (8pm) which meant it was fairly quiet (only a few other parties). All of our meals were delicious and beautifully presented. We will visit with yet another couple within the next couple months. Looking forward to it.
September 6, 2014|Fantastic all around.|5|I had the caramelized sea scallops with shrimp and my girlfriend had the North Atlantic salmon, both melt in your mouth delicious. Service was top notch and it's a great atmosphere. First there and will definitely return.
September 6, 2014|Great food, great service|4|My husband and I have been to CAV a few times, but not in a while. It's always been very good and this visit did not disappoint. Not only was the food delicious, but our waiter Gary was gracious, fun and had expert timing. It's nice when the wait staff doesn't hurry you along or make you wonder where your food is. He made our night enjoyable and relaxing.
September 5, 2014|Eclectic with Great Food|4|Very eclectic decor with great food. Good service, helpful and friendly staff. Really enjoyed our dinner.
September 5, 2014|Fantastic night out.|5|Arrived on a Friday at 7:00 pm. Place was a little difficult to find and parking isn't very clear. Walked in and there was one other couple in the entire restaurant, which was surprising considering the day and time. My date had a Bloody Mary (for dinner??) and said it was fantastic. I ordered a dry Manhattan with a twist, received one with a cherry (Manhattan enthusiasts will feel my pain). Food was excellent! Had calamari, which was unique and delicious. For entrees, we both had clams and pasta in red sauce. One of the best plates of pasta I've had in a while. Pasta and clams were prepared properly, and the sauce was quite tasty and ever-so-slightly spicy! My date and I both finished our entire plates. Left at 9pm, and CAV was packed.
August 28, 2014|Perfect !|5|Execptional food, excelent service , romantic and out standing ambience ! Worth every penny ! Never been in a better place !
August 24, 2014|Hidden gem|5|Great service and food. The decor is eclectic and I believe some items are for sale. Attentive waiter and overall staff. Restroom was clean. We went for brunch and loved it! All items were reasonable priced and appropriate portions.
August 23, 2014|Top Notch!|5|I came here with some colleagues and the appetizers (baked brie, crab cakes, mushroom bruschetta) were amazing! We ordered two bottles of wine, which were also very good. Moving on to dinner, two of us ordered the scallops and shrimp, which was by far the BEST scallops I've EVER had!! Melted in your mouth with perfection! Another individual ordered the crusted tuna and he said it was wonderful. The other three individuals ordered the Hake special and were beyond disappointed. They said it was bland with no flavor. When the owner found this out, she comp'd the meals and brought out two scallops for each of them. We were beyond pleased with this kind of service! Dessert was also very delicious. Great little hidden gem in Providence!
August 21, 2014|nice night out|4|We went with 5 people. Greeter was gracious, welcoming. Menu interesting -we ordered the Malbec special. Waiter had almost no idea of the food ingredients for any item of which we inquired. Thought the mascarpone cheese with port wine fumet was the crab/corn mousseline served with the Hake. timing of service was fine. The bacon/sweet topping on the Hake was great. My crusted tuna on greens was great. others didn't rave about theirs - the wild mushrooms with risotto were really tasty but the risotto itself was bland and needed some great asiago or romano or something! the Pasta Florentine looked fine - but I didn't taste it. Calamari app was nicely spiced and little breading. Creme Brulee was way too runny, though top was crunchy.
August 20, 2014|Yummy|5|This was our second visit and once again the food was wonderful. We highly recommend the bruschetta, the calamari and the Caesar salad-all were delicious. The scallops and the filet were perfectly prepared. We all belonged to the clean plate club. The only disappointment was the chocolate chip cookie we ordered for dessert.
August 18, 2014|CAV! Uber Provy!|5|We visited CAV for dinner to celebrate our family who we don't see often enough. We drove down from Boston to meet up and we were absolutely delighted to have a wonderful meal. CAV is not only delicious tasting but a wonderful visual feast as well. The location and decor was outstanding; romantic, tasteful antiquities abound. Our food was superb! The folks working there took great care of us, so nice and fun with a sense of style and humour. They seated us in a great 'staged' spot and provided complimentary champagne for us and our special guest. I enjoyed the chicken and pears dish. Sublime! Also we feasted on amazing scallops and crab cakes plus fantastic pan seared smoky calamari. Go to CAV when in Providence! Cheers!
August 17, 2014|Perfectly Amazing|5|Second time coming to this restaurant. Food was impeccable. Started with the walnut encrusted brie and wild mushroom crostini. Simply superb. The flavors from the mushrooms were out of this world. I followed with the scallops which were literally the best I've ever had. Another diner had the mushroom risotto and another a homemade pasta. Truly remarkable. Sadly, we were too full for dessert, but we're already planning our next trip to Providence to take part in this amazing culinary treat!
August 15, 2014| The dining experience was awesome. They...|5|The dining experience was awesome. They catered to my needs for space as a tall individual and the need for a high with a 7 month old. We were never forgotten about and the kitchen when above and beyond when they prepared and off menu item for my son to eat during our entree course. I was very pleased and surprised at the catering they provided.
August 15, 2014|Reacquainted|4|It's been a while since we've been to CAV but a recent visit brought to mind all the things we like about this establishment. We arrived early for our reservation but our host got a table for us right away. We were no sooner seated when our server was there to take our beverage order. The menu is sophisticated and the food is prepared expertly. The only negative thing I could comment on was the noise level, but that's indicative of the popularity of the place. If you've never been you should try it.
August 11, 2014|Excellent dinner|5|Still one of our favorite restaurants in providence. Excellent atmosphere and great food as always. One of the best chowders around for the appetizer.
August 9, 2014|CAV doesn't disappoint|4|Our 3rd or 4th time at CAV in the past 10 years or so. We love the ambience--antiques and cultural artifacts gathered by the owner from around the world, unique fabrics on each table, interesting lighting fixtures, etc. Appetizers varied a good deal in size so it was difficult to tell how well they could be divided but each was unique and tasty. Entrees were a little uneven. I loved my seared tuna entree. My wife's pasta entree was very pedestrian, heavy on the cheese, and light on any particularly unique flavor. Enjoyed the wine. Overall a beautiful night and I imagine we will return again.
August 9, 2014|Special food and special atmosphere|4|Eating a delicious meal around beautiful antiques is not something I've had the chance to do and not something I'm sure I'll ever do again! The menu was exciting, the waiter was helpful in guiding our choices, and the food was beautifully presented and very flavorful. A few of the items on the menu were a bit pedestrian (brie with apricots and some supermarket crackers) but if you are willing to pick the adventurous items, you will be rewarded.
August 2, 2014|Fantastic place!|5|We found this gem of a restaurant on Frommers website. The food, service, and ambiance was phenomenal. Appetizers, entree, alcohol, and tip included brought us to about $75 per person. It was well worth it!
August 2, 2014|Great Providence hidden Jewel|5|We were 2 couples enjoying dinner out on a Saturday evening. The food, atmosphere and service were all Excellent!! We will be back again for sure!
Dined on July 27, 2014|A Jewel in the City|5|A favorite for years. Love having a place that you can bring locals and visitors to that ALWAYS pleases. Have yet to introduce anyone to this great setting with food to match and have them be less than delighted. Brunch great and the back room for a private party a real treasure. Ask for Vincent as a waiter. A gifted artist who has a Harry Firestone Vibe.
July 24, 2014|Birthday dinner|5|My husband and I took my parents out to CAV to celebrate my mother's birthday. They said it was perhaps the best meal they've had at a restaurant in years. It also happened to be the restaurant week so they had specials for a 3-course option. The service was wonderful, very thoughtful and pleasant. It was also where we had our rehearsal dinner so it holds a special spot for us. The food was absolutely delicious, blowing us away. They were also able to accomodate my food allergies including gluten, dairy and cane sugar.
July 19, 2014|Great food!|5|The food, the service, everything was amazing! I would recommend with eyes closed.
July 19, 2014|Elegantly funky|5|The decor of CAV is definitely unique - we love it and the atmosphere it creates. The food was wonderful as well - the steak cooked rare to order and the duck confit (with blood orange brandy demi glaze) melted in my mouth. Our appetizer, a minted white bean bruschetta and the Blackberry Merlot Sorbet for dessert were also excellent choices. The service was attentive without hovering.
July 19, 2014|Excellent Cullinary Experience|4|This was our first experience at CAV. There were four of us, and the food throughout the meal, from appetizers, mains and desserts were all outstanding - presentation, flavor and serving size were all first rate. The décor is eclectic, but don't let that throw you off from an outstanding culinary experience. Our server seemed a little distant at first, and did not explain the restaurant week menu despite our request. However, he became more engaged as the meal progressed, and the service overall was attentive and very good.
July 19, 2014|Very interesting restaurant in concept, ...|5|Very interesting restaurant in concept, decor, location, etc. My wife and I thouroughly enjoyed the food and thought that the service was excellent. We definitely expect to return.
July 19, 2014|fabulous night with dear friends|5|Outstanding service and attention. Food beyond great. Would recommend to anyone interested in an memorable experience.
July 18, 2014|Hidden away|4|On a Friday night, I got the Restaurant Week fixed price menu with the appetizer add on. All the food was well prepared. The only thing I would say is that the Minted White Bean Bruschetta, while delicious, wasn't Bruschetta. The long skinny toast points that came with the dish were not large enough or substantial enough to put the beans on. I ended up eating the beans with the spoon provided for serving and the toast separately. Also, as a hint, don't sit facing the windows if the sun is setting - the light will shine directly into your eyes blinding you. The staff was very attentive. The wait between courses was a little longer than I am used to, but that is not necessarily a criticism. I didn't feel rushed to finish up.
July 18, 2014|ALWAYS wonderful- we took visitors|5|On this episode of dinner at Cav- we brought our family, visiting from DSM, IA. They found the scallops to be delectable. I had the Cavatelli made Vegetarian style and it was scrumptious. The surroundings provide ample opportunity for world travel and spiritual discussion. If you haven't yet dined at Cav, what are you waiting for? :) GO
July 18, 2014|First visit|4|Went to CAV on recommendation of a friend and enjoyed everything about it. Lovely room, good service and food. Will definitely be back
July 17, 2014|Excellence|5|CAV remains a superb choice for an eclectic evening
July 16, 2014|A delightful experience|5|Went during restaurant week. Both my companion and I got the price fixe menu. It was fabulous. Waitstaff was attentive and friendly; not intrusive. Happy to engage in conversation when we initiated. Pacing was relaxed, which was good. Food was prepared to perfection and looked beautiful on the plate. House chardonnay was fabulous. We walked from a hotel on Matthewson St. and the neighborhood on the way there looked creepy and sketchy. But once we rounded the corner to the charming little courtyard and entered the place, it was like leaving Kansas and entering Oz. A completely delightful and satisfying experience.
July 15, 2014|Great food, just ok service.|4|It was busy and our waiter was nice, but the service was a little slow. Only 3 of 4 dishes came out at first and the woman assisting the waiter forgot to bring out the 4th. She started doing other things instead. After 5-7 minutes I had to remind her. The food was amazing as always and I will still be back.
July 13, 2014|We decided to try it out because it was ...|5|We decided to try it out because it was on the restaurant week list. We were very impressed by the menu and how delicious the food is. I will definitely be back.
July 12, 2014|CAV is a great restaurant with an amazin...|4|CAV is a great restaurant with an amazing decor and a lovely courtyard to sit outside in the warm weather. I love this place.
July 5, 2014|Interesting Location|4|My wife and I walked to have dinner here after seeing a show at the Dunkin Donuts Center. I guess this is a new section of town, because as we got closer, there were a lot of empty buildings, vacant lots and new roads. Nothing bad, just a little odd. Once we got to the restaurant, it was all good. Interesting decor, great wine, good variety of menu options. Everything we had was delicious.
July 4, 2014|very cool unique spot. We love the food ...|5|very cool unique spot. We love the food here. Never had a bad meal
July 4, 2014|6 people in a tropical storm|5|In lieu of postponed fireworks due to inclement weather- we impromptu made a reservation for 6 at CAV using Open Table and as we walked in the door, they were setting up our table. Food and service were impeccable as always. I do wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu. I highly recommend CAV for lunch, brunch, dinner etc...
July 3, 2014|Romantic spot|5|The cav is beautiful operating resturant in the old jewelry district in prov ri it's run so nicely hope it stays for many a more years.
July 2, 2014|The dining room is very interesting with...|5|The dining room is very interesting with the various displays of antiques and art a very comfortable setting. Service was prompt and attentive. The calamari as an appertizer was very good, and very tender. The duck entree was excellent with the confit and breast. The shrimp entree was also very well prepared. They have a very good wine selection. Definitely a good choice for a nice dinner.
June 28, 2014|Overpriced, mediocre food|2|One small piece of lobster in pasta for $29. Rip off. Mediocre steak for $33.
June 28, 2014|Amazing find in a strange location|5|"This isn't in Federal Hill where most Providence restaurants are located but this was an unexpected great find! The interior decor is snazzy and fun. Service was excellent, and menu offerings were eclectic and ""oh so delicious"". We'd definitely return!"
June 21, 2014|A Gem!|5|We went to this wonderful restaurant while in Providence ri on a visit last weekend. The food was fantastic...the place is alive with interesting African art and the service was wonderful. I would definitely return. The seared tuna was delightful and I loved the salted carmel gelato. A wonderful treat...
June 20, 2014|Excellent restaurant|4|Four of us went to dinner at CAV. Each had something different from appetizer to dessert and everything was very good - fresh and uniquely prepared. Service was very good and the atmosphere was interesting and not fairly quiet. The prices are above average but normal for a restaurant of this level. We particularly liked the striped bass with risotto but the salmon and lobster pasta were also good. The fruit tart for dessert is also recommended.
June 19, 2014|Best place in Providence|5|We just loved dining at the CAV Restaurant. It was our favorite night out while staying in Providence. The food was superb and the atmosphere was like we were dining right in the middle of an antique shop. Love, Love, Loved this place.
June 15, 2014|A great find|5|My wife and I were introduced to this unique restaurant at a wedding reception and loved it. We have come back here for special occasions, or just on a whim, and love introducing others to the place. I would highly recommend it.
June 15, 2014|Went to CAV for Father's Day and we had ...|5|Went to CAV for Father's Day and we had a great meal! We got there early but they sat us even though it was 30 mins before they officially opened! They were so gracious about our screw up and served us right away. The food was delicious although our teeanage son thought there should have been more food to an order. We will definately go again if we are near Providence.
June 7, 2014|Magical|5|The restaurant is gorgeous--- from the moment you walk up. The food is incredible- easily the best meal I've had in a long time. The service is wonderful- every single person is friendly and helpful. It's clear they love the place as well. The only thing we didn't love was the parking situation... it's just a desolate parking lot- nice to have free parking, but I wouldn't want to park there late into the night.
June 7, 2014|blingbaby52|5|We picked Cav for my husband's birthday dinner. We loved the bruschetta appetizer. For dinner I ordered the encrusted seared sesame tuna. I like mine barely seared and it came out perfect. My husband ordered the hangar steak with pepper sauce, which was almost too peppery, but he was enjoying it. Our waitress offered to replace it, but he said it wasn't necessary. For dessert they brought him a flourless chocolate cake that was filled with a rich chocolate mousse. The presentation was gorgeous and the cake was delicious! When we left our server brought us a new hangar steak and the leftover dessert. She made sure nothing spoiled his birthday! We had a spectacular meal with superb service. We'll be back!
May 31, 2014|Bad first and last impression |2|Heard it was the Chef's last night cooking at CAV and was disappointed by not only the food but our horrible service!!! $262 total bill for four and gave a portion of our waiters tip to another waitress who repeatedly kept covering for his horrible service. Truffle ravioli lacked flavor and was 90% all oil in the dish. The staff was standing aside eating a laid out spread of desserts while we sat there and waited for our own dessert menus. We almost asked to join their party since they apparently didnt care about ours. Not the way I'd like to be remembered on my last night cooking.
May 30, 2014|Birthday Dinner|5|I had a great birthday dinner at CAV. I enjoyed the duck entree and my wife had the fresh pasta. We shared a great plate of bruschetta too! I'll be coming back!
May 22, 2014|Marcia Parks|5|Delightful dining experience: the food was delicious, presentation was attractive, service was prompt and polite without being intrusive.

May 18, 2014|Enjoyed the wonderful brunch|5|We've been there twice for brunch and found the food, ambience and service to be top notch. Very reasonably priced with a nice specialty drink menu as well.
May 16, 2014|Hidden Jewel|5|Cav is one of those places that you walk in and your blown away. Everytime I go there I notice something new. The decor is great with beautiful chandeliers and jewels hanging everywhere. The service is impeccable each and every time. My friends and I always enjoy the banter we have with our server and how on point they are every time. Some of my friends are rather particular when it comes to places we eat and this has turned into one of our favorites. I would recommend the parmesan encrusted chicken, yummilicous...
May 10, 2014|Pleasant and Tasty!|5|Although it was tricky driving through the dug up streets of Providence, dinner was very enjoyable. The service was excellent at the beginning, but it did slow down a bit once we got our food. The ambience is special, and clearly sets CAV apart from most of the typical restaurants.
May 10, 2014|Lovely|4|We chose Cav for a pre-show dinner and could not have been more thrilled. The food was delicious and our waiter incredible in tune with our needs.
May 10, 2014|Slipped|2|Have dined here before, always good. Quite a bit off this time. My favorite appertizer of Butter Poached Lobster was sold out at an early dinner time of 5:30. My guest,s Entree of Diver Scallops was very good. My Appertizer of Duck Confit Stuffed Zucchini Blossoms was terrible. Way too much Tempura Batter, looked like a plate of Corndogs. Not a good match. My Entree of Grilled Amberjack Fish with Dill, a dinner special, was very bland and underseasoned.except for Dill, which is all I tasted. Hope it was just a bad night, as I have always liked this restaurant
May 8, 2014|Fabulous!|5|We had a birthday in our family group of 6. We arrived on time and were seated immediately. It was a slow night, which is nice because we were able to take in the full ambiance without rushing,.The service was spectacular, the food was Fabulous. My 14 year old is a picky eater and was able to find the chicken dish extremely enjoyable. He is a slow eater and the server never rushed him. Kudos to the server for that. we highly recommend CAV...
May 4, 2014|Mostly good|4|Our meal was very good overall. The bruschetta was superb. The caeser salad was slightly underdressed and a bit bland. We each ordered a pasta dish, one of which was very good and the other a bit too rich--more focused on the butter and cream rather than the pasta and lobster meat. One of our drinks was excellent (St. Germain margarita), the other watery and disappointing (cosmo). The bottom line: this was a very good meal, but incredibly pricy. When I spend close to $100 per person, I expect to see stars!
Dined on May 3, 2014|It Was Ok|3|I had been wanting to go here many times. The first time we tried, we got bumped by a private Christmas party which really stunk. We finally made it! The food was good and our server was nice. The first impression what bad though because they had someone greet us at the door that spoke no English. I tried speaking Spanish hoping that he was either a Spanish speaker or spoke Portuguese, but no luck. He couldn't even direct me to the bathroom. It surmised my initial opinion of the place after we were booted due to the party on 12/15/13, then the owner promised to get us something to make it right but never did and then we got there and voila, another miscommunication snafu. Frustrating. We will not go here again.
April 27, 2014|Great brunch|5|Enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch. Had a reservation and seated right away. Large number of choices on the menu. Good service and great food. Ample size portions.
April 27, 2014|Wonderful find in Providence|5|As out-of-towners, we were looking for a place to meet up with family from NH for brunch on a Sunday in Providence. What a find CAV was. It exceeded our expectations. The food was fabulous. Two of us had the crab cake with poached egg on sweet bread. Another had the feta and spinach omelet, and two others had the wonderfully looking French toast with apples. The service was impeccable with just enough attention without being intrusive. And the Bloody Marys were very fine! The décor also adds to the experience. It is eclectic and interesting. Although I don't know that we have an occasion to be back in Providence anytime soon, it will definitely be on our list to return to for another wonderful adventure. You will not be disappointed.
April 26, 2014|Love this place!|5|My daughter goes to college in Providence and I get to CAV as often as I can. The service is friendly and efficient and the food has never disappointed. The food is fresh and the flavor combinations are always such a pleasure. One of the guests in my party last Saturday night had the salmon with lichee, I had blackened grouper with pineapple salsa and two others had the mushroom risotto. Everyone loved their food and we had every sorbet for dessert. I highly recommend CAV.
April 26, 2014|Hopeless Romantic Hit|5|The place was absolutely beautiful and the food was wonderful! If you are looking for a great date night or just a place to enjoy a special meal at the CAV is the place to go. Food was great and the presentation perfect!
April 15, 2014|Eclectic|5|It was very different than any other restaurant in Providence. A unique atmosphere but very warm and comfortable, I would go back again for sure.
April 10, 2014|Birthday lunch|5|Took my best friend to the CAV for her birthday and it was a hit! We both love the ambience, staff is very pleasant attentive good selection of Entrees salads yummy desserts. Lots of time to chat we were not rushed. Will be back!
March 30, 2014|Great brunch|5|The brunch has a well-executed, imaginative menu and very good service.
March 29, 2014|Remains a standout|5|I agree with NYT that lists CAV as one of the top five restaurants in Providence. Many visits and always a good experience.
March 29, 2014|Always a dining pleasure|5|Although I don't live in Rhode Island, I have been dining at CAV for over 20 years...my go to restaurant in Providence. I have never been disappointed...this time was no exception. I have introduced many people to CAV and they have all loved the food, the ambience and the service. Can't wait til my next visit!
March 27, 2014|Great spot|5|I was there for lunch, but I wish I could go back for dinner soon! The menu looked great and our lunch sandwiches and salads were fresh and super tasty. Service was attentive, but not pushy. The atmosphere was great, even during the day. I can imagine that it's a pretty romantic spot at night.
March 23, 2014|Very good food|5|My wife and I have been here twice for Sunday brunch and have not been disappointed. We are considering dinner here in the future. Very romantic setting.
March 22, 2014|Ambiance, Food, Equally Wonderful|5|The Cav provides a uniquely beautiful and comfortable setting for elegant dining, matched by innovative dishes perfectly prepared and presented. The service is top notch. Altogether, it makes for a memorable evening.
March 22, 2014|Consistantly Fantastic|5|My wife and I have now been to CAV on multiple occasions and each time the food, service, and ambiance has been outstanding! The restaurant is very eclectic and the menu offers something for everyone. The Point Judith Calamari appetizer is awesome and tuna entree is AMAZING. I had the Spanish clam special appetizer and the seafood around the world special entree and both were dynamite. CAV has quickly become our FAVORITE.
March 15, 2014|most try|3|my 1st time here with my boyfriend celebrating our 3 month anniversary - pei mussel as appetizer was awesome where we wish we had more bread to dip into the broth but our server was too busy waiting on other tables. i had the Pan Seared Diver Sea Scallops and Shrimp, finished with lobster butter where i could not taste the lobster butter and the riosotto was not what i excepted to be alittle more season or cheesy. my bf had NY strip from the special menu and it was cooked to his liking but there were parts of the wine reduction that was very pungent and needed to cook down a little more. overall, lovely and romantic night-lighting and glass/crystal decor hanging from the ceiling. the service is good just little more attentive.
March 13, 2014|Eclectic dining|5|CAV is a unique gem hidden in the heart of the Jewelry District of Providence…a haven of exotic global decor...
March 9, 2014|A hidden gem|4|This has become one of my favorite restaurants. The food was delicious and the prices are reasonable. The atmosphere and decor make this spot a hidden gem.
March 8, 2014|disappointed|1|Although we have dined numerous times in the past, we were disappointed in this visit and honestly probably not come back. The food was excellent as usual, but service was very slow and scattered. Our waiter seemed very distracted and it felt like he would have preferred not to wait on our table. We were there for our sister-in-laws birthday. She asked me to pick the restaurant because she likes my taste, but I felt bad that experience did not live up to our expectations. We spent nearly $400 here, won't do it again.
March 8, 2014|Excellent night out|5|Went there last minute, got right in. Food, service and atmosphere were superb.
March 4, 2014|Outstanding service|4|Another notable Providence restaurant that satisfied all diners in our party. Ambience was artful and warm, and the service was outstanding.
March 3, 2014|Nice venue, food was good,|3|Nice venue, food was good, but nothing special. Overall it was overpriced as well.
March 2, 2014|fun environment/excellent service|4|Thoroughly enjoyable, somewhat eclectic environment; prompt and attentive service; excellent menu for brunch
March 1, 2014|Solid restaurant, but underwhelmed|3|Had dinner here before a show in Providence. Very weird decor, as it is basically an old antique / curios shop, but that had a sort of charm to it. The service / staff were excellent, perfectly attentive without being overbearing. Had the crab-cake appetizer.. tasty and nice/large chunks of crab, but a tad dry. Nice sauce to spice it up though. For dinner, I had the duo of duck. it was a solid dish, but the breast was more medium and the skin wasn't crispy and the confit was over-sauced. My wife's seafood / risotto dish was also solid, but not spectacular. I have no real complaints, but for the price of the place, i had higher expectations
February 22, 2014|Never disappointed!|5|Have been to CAV on many occassions..... Took friends who had never been..... As expected, they enjoyed their experience at CAV.... A bit pricey but the food is always exceptional.... Friendly and attentive wait staff..... Will be back soon.....
February 14, 2014|valentine night disaster|2|i had heard good things about CAV from friends and from reviews on yelp. we have been to many higher end restaurants in the providence area. as we walked into the restaurant we were overwhelmed by the amount of extra tables CAV had squeezed in to accomodate extra reservations. the tables were literally a foot apart in some areas. as we sat down our waiter was clearly frazzled by the amount of tables he had. the bottle of wine took approx 30 mins to get to the table. we had to ask for bread 3 times before we received it.we ordered goat cheese croquettes for an app and were dissapointed after waiting 1 1/2 hrs for it!!!. both our entrees were ok but for $30 i expect excellent. i expect great service and great food and got neither.
February 14, 2014|Great Food!|4|I went to CAV with my wife for Valentines Day dinner for our second year in a row. The place was a lot more crowded than normal. They definitely crammed in extra tables because it was valentines day which made us feel a little less comfortable than normal and likely contributed to the mediocre service we received that night. The service was much better on previous trips to CAV. However , one thing that didn't change was the quality of the food. I had the filet and my wife had a lobster pasta dish. Both were extremely tasty. I would recommend this place if your looking for something unique and new.
February 8, 2014|Recommend|4|Found CAV on OpenTable with no prior knowledge of this restaurant. Nice atmosphere, broad selection of menu choices, attentive service and good food. Definitely recommend.
February 4, 2014|Satisfying but not special|4|I hadn't been to CAV in five years and returned for a small birthday dinner. The restaurant is lovely - the warm colors and decor made it a cozy spot for a cold winter night. The food is good but not outstanding. The menu seems safe and without much surprise. It is a good safe choice but not special enough to make me rush back for more.
January 27, 2014|Dissapointing experience|2|The place looked uniques and I took 2 colleagues there for lunch. We were not asked if we wanted anything to g to drink. No bread basket for our table. Everyone else around us got one. There were 2 waiters for the whole restaurant who were not very friendly at all and pretty curt. When we walked in place smelled funny and looked dirty as well. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was toasted bread with ice cold toppings in the middle of the plate to make your own. The tomatoes were so cold you could not bite into them. The rest of the food was mediocre as well. The Italian tuna wrap was really salty and garlicky. Very dissapointing and I will not go there again. dirty.
January 25, 2014|A little disappointing...|3|We've been here before and it had been a great experience. This time seemed more busy than usual. Maybe that made a difference. This time around the service was very slow. The kitchen was backed up because of a large party. They brought out some wine while we waited. It happens. Calamari, tuna, hanger steak. The calamari was good, but not amazing. The tuna was very good. I recommend it. My wife's steak was ok. She said she's had better. It was undercooked and had to be sent back, but that happens too. The desert was great (salted caramel ice cream) as was the espresso. I hope it was the backup... We'll probably try again.
January 25, 2014|Bustling Antique Shop/Bar|4|The restaurant and bar are fairly small, you have to walk down a small path to find the nearly hidden entrance. Once inside it's warm and inviting with lots of unusual antiques and nick-nacks to give visual interest. The lighting is low to give it an intimate feel. For me, the prices were a bit on the high side, but the food turned out quite good. If you're looking for a cute date night or someplace different to go to, I would recommend Cav. Also, I looked over the lunch menu and those prices seemed much more on point with my typical dining budget, so you might want to start there!
January 23, 2014|We went during Restaurant|4|We went during Restaurant week which was great for us because we leave in the building adjacent to CAV and we were always skeptical about price but not anymore. We were amazed as to how delicious the food was, the best Duck Confit I've ever had; steak cooked perfectly. We definitely will frequent CAV much more often now that we have a memorable experience to live off of. Tasting is Believing!
January 20, 2014|Perfect 25th anniversary Dinner|5|My husband and I were looking for an interesting but special place to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, and found CaV at this site. It was delightful. the restaurant was hidden away from the street, and appeared like an oasis out of the old factory buildings. Our service was impeccable, with cheerful, helpful and professional attentivenes. And then, there was the food! It was varied and delicious. Crab cake appetizer was crab meat with a bit of a bite from the aioli. Port wine pears with the chicken were unique and well-deserving of the awards it has won. Jim's filet was the best medium rare one he can remember being served, and there wasn't even a smidgen of bordelaise sauce on his plate when he finished.
January 18, 2014|Magical, spiritual, a lot|4|Magical, spiritual, a lot of soul and feelings. A very special place with character. The good is really good . My favorite in town.
January 18, 2014|Consistent pleasure|5|The atmosphere and decor are comfortable, filled with African art, and interesting lighting. It's cozy, comfortable, and always a great meal.
January 18, 2014|Great Evening|5|Food was delicious and service was perfection. We had an amazing time and will be back! highly recommend for fine dinning. Attire for dinner business casual or elegant and you would fit right in!
January 18, 2014|Beautiful Decor, Horrible Service|2|Walking in, we were immediately impressed by the beautiful decor of the place. It seemed really cozy and charming. However, the food wasn't very good at all (risotto was mushy and ravioli was overly salty). The service was also very poor. It was busy, but they largely ignored our table and were not friendly at all.
January 17, 2014|Perfect night out!|5|My husband and I decided to try CAV during restaurant week. We are so glad we did! Not only was the food delicious but the building is full of character! Our waiter was great too! Can't wait to go back....we will be bringing friends too!
January 17, 2014|Must try|5|Took too long for me to try this neighborhood gem. My loss. Thoroughly enjoyed the decor, the food was great.
January 17, 2014|Great dinner outing|4|This is the first time back to CAV in a few years. They were extremely service oriented, with the host giving us a little silver angel made by a local artist. The restaurant is a little off the beaten path but well worth the trip. The goat cheese croquettes and Lobster Bisque with Tahitian Vanilla were excellent.
Dined on January 17, 2014|OMG...the shrimp risotto with|5|OMG...the shrimp risotto with Gorgonzola cheese and brussel sprouts was absolutely heaven in a plate....I would have never thought it to be so yummy but thankfully the waiter made the suggestion and I went with it...SO happy I did! We were there during Restaurant Week and I would definitely recommend it and go back again! Thanks for the experience!
January 13, 2014|A Great Find|4|While traveling on business we went with OpenTable's suggestion on CAV Restaurant. The food was well prepared and had amazing flavor. The main course and sides were well matched and the portions were perfect. The inside of the restaurant is worth the visit itself. The dining and bar area is filled with many crystal chandeliers and decorative glass hangings. The ambiance is not formal, but more eclectic for the lack of a better term. The service is average. I believe the restaurant needs to polish up their waiters presentation and service. Drink glasses were going empty for too long and the staff seemed very occupied with socializing with each other. Still a very good experience.
January 12, 2014|Old favorite|4|Haven't been here in years and were drawn to the Providence Restaurant week event. Great variety of selections to chose from on both menus. Ambiance was interesting and fun. Service was well done. Will have to go back to try their brunch menu.
January 10, 2014|Always a pleasure|5|I have never been disappointed in my dining experience at CAV. It has a funky yet elegant atmosphere. The food is always superb, as is the presentation. The wait staff couldn't be more accommodating. And free parking!!! I never hesitate to recommend CAV to a friend. We dined before attending a show at the PPAC. A great beginning to a great night!
January 9, 2014|Food is ok, although somewhat|3|Food is ok, although somewhat lacks creativity. The soups I have tried have ranged from a watery lentil soup (Progresso makes a much better lentil) to a very subpar almost tasteless clam chowder.
January 1, 2014|Again met my (high) expectations|4|Late-ish (1:30P) lunch on NY Day. Between mid-week holiday / cold temps, was understandably only modestly busy. As a result, food came out quickly. That said, we were never rushed. In fact, server (doubling as host) picked up on fact this was a first date for us and, instead of seating us next to another table as he initially intended, offered us a quieter, more remote table. Having not been to CAV in 6+ months, wasn't sure if it would live up to my expectations and prior experiences (2-3 times; always great). It did. Menu has much to offer regardless of diet (my date is vegetarian; I don't eat red meat). If I have one very slight criticism it's the relatively limited 'by the glass' wine selection. This is a 'can't miss' option.
December 30, 2013|Worldly spot|4|The ambience of CAV is so eclectic and magical making it a wonderful venue!
December 28, 2013|Seriously a hidden gem!|5|The inside is so unique and so cozy and comfortably warm. The concierge and every single waiter was friendly and attentive. The bar and the selection of drinks was great. The food was ridiculous. It was so good that if we could have licked our plates we would have. My fiancé had the lamb and it was amazing. I had the scallops and they were cooked so perfectly. We both didn't know where to go that night so thanks to OpenTable we found this place and made our reservations. We were really happy we did. In fact we're going again this weekend with a couple of our friends. And when you see the location of it you understand why it is a little hidden gem of a restaurant. It's one of our new favorite places!
December 28, 2013|unique dinning|5|loved it good food ,atmosphere is amazing...must go
December 27, 2013|Excellent Meal!|5|Excellent meal - compliments to the chef! Great place to hit before PPAC!
December 24, 2013|Solid choice for many occasions|4|Nice variety of foods for people with varying tastes. Relaxed atmosphere but still elegant. Friendly and attentive staff without being obsequious
December 24, 2013|We had a delicious meal for|5|We had a delicious meal for xmas eve. Everyone loved their choices - from the duck/gorgonzola cheese pizza and the wild mushroom crostini and house salad with champagne vinaigrette dressing, to the sesame encrusted tune, monk fish, pasta florentine, and filet mignon and then yummy desserts, The waiter paired the wine perfectly as well. We would definitely return. Atmosphere was festive.
December 14, 2013|No other place like it|4|I'm so glad to have found this place. The food is always great, the wine is good Added to this, the building it's located in and the decor are what makes this place stand out. The owner has collected art from all over Africa and Asia and it lines the walls and ceilings, giving it an unusual and exotic atmosphere. The overall effect is second to none. Try it for a special occasion and you won't regret it.
December 7, 2013|CAV Experience|5|We are not from Providence and CAV was not easy to find, especially with some road closures and construction, but I was glad we persevered because it was a great restaurant. Excellent service, cocktails and food all made for a delightful experience. I would definitely return.
December 6, 2013|A little mix up...|5|When we first arrived there was a little mix up with our reservation - they had us down for 7:30, instead of 6:30. However, the owner apologized profusely and personally sat us at the bar, and ordered us a couple drinks and an appetizer to make up for the error. She also continued to stop by on occasion to check up on us. When there still wasn't an open table at 7:30, because of the large parties that still hadn't left, she insisted on comp'ing the whole meal for us. We did get a table around 8:00, but it almost didn't matter at that point. The owner and her staff had been so gracious, and the food was so good, that it didn't matter that we sat at the bar. Because of the great hospitality and delicious food we will be returning!
December 5, 2013|Delicious!|5|I've eaten here many times and always love it! I had my usual entrée of Diver Scallops & Shrimp with lemon risotto and it was as good as ever! Others at the table enjoyed a duck dish, chicken and pears poached in red wine and cavatelli pasta with white beans and shrimp. All the plates were empty at the end of the meal. Yummy!
December 1, 2013|Unique Atmosphere if not Food|4|The room outshines the menu at CAV. The room is a trip in-a-half: part curio, part antique shop, part world wide flea market, the owner is either well traveled or a hoarder. Knickknack's galore; priced not to sell! Dinner was a pleasant surprise on the Sunday night we visited. The large dining room was very empty at 6:00 (always a cause for concern). Apps were not exciting but frankly, tasty. The French inspired meals for our table of four were made well and enjoyed by all. If not memorable it also was not disappointing! The red wine was too warm when served, taken care of by my asking for it to be slightly brought down in temp by resting in the fridge. It is in an out-of-the-way industrial part of Providence, but, all in all worth the trip
November 29, 2013|Enjoyable!|5|Spur of the moment get together with friends. The food was superb and atmosphere was enjoyable because the noise level was low.
November 23, 2013|CAV is fantastic!|5|The service was fantastic! We had a minor problem with one of the dishes. The owner not only addressed the situation but brought out an additional entree AND made the initial entree over so that we could enjoy it at home the next day! IN addition she did not charge us for the first entree. All in all one of the best experiences at a restaurant EVER!
November 16, 2013|Great food with vibrant surrounding|4|Cav was hopping when we arrived. The host greeted us and led us to a cozy table in the mid section of the restaurant. Beautiful fabrics drape the area along with lovely chandelier lighting. The wait staff were very attentive, drinks were fantastic and the food was beautifully presented and delicious! We will be returning to CAV!
November 7, 2013|Mediterranean Delight|5|Awesome decor, ambience, food and service. Wonderful experience. Can't wait to go back.
November 5, 2013|My Duck Breast and crispy|3|My Duck Breast and crispy leg confit were reasonably Tasty. The presentation was nice but the leg was not crispy. The sauce was flavorful but too syrupy. My wife's chicken special with poached pears looked and sounded much better than it tasted. The chicken was not particularly flavorful and the poached pears were hard and too spiced. We went there at the last minute, the ambience was nice enough, and other people seemed to be enjoying their meals. All in all, it was an OK meal but nothing great.
November 4, 2013|Great food & atmosphere|4|I took a small group here for a business dinner, and we had a great night--the restaurant is quiet enough to allow for table-wide conversation, the service was simple but good, and the food was fantastic,. It would be a hard call between CAV and Pane e Vino, where we were the night before--both were excellent. In nicer weather, the courtyard would be great, too. The decor is a little overwhelming at first, but it works for the place--we will definitely be back!
November 3, 2013|Brunch|4|We had a lovely brunch here. The menu is varied but short. We had variations of eggs and each was delicious. The service was very good. Would go again.
November 3, 2013|Quirky and good|4|The place is a strange amalgam of a restaurant and an antique store. As the menu says, everything is for sale. We went for Sunday Brunch. While there was not a wide variety of brunch options (you cannot order from the lunch menu despite what the web site may imply), the food was DELICIOUS. This was one of those occasions where everyone in the party ordered something different and everyone consumed every morsel of food delivered. The egg dishes were exceptional.
October 26, 2013|One of the best in Providence.|5|We've dined here a few times and it's always excellent. Decorated funky cool. Everything was very good, service, food, wine list etc. Reasonable prices. You are not rushed, not a lot of tables stuffed next to eachother. I find myself saving this place for special occasions because it is so special but I think I should come here more often. One of the best in Providence.
October 19, 2013|Delicious Food & Excellent Service|5|Our waiter was excellent. Very attentive, but not overbearing and could speak about the menu items with knowledge. Our food came and we were blown away. It was all incredibly delicious and each of us cleared our plates.
October 19, 2013|Fantastic place. Haven't been|5|Fantastic place. Haven't been there for years and went this past Saturday night for my anniversary. They gave us a special table and treated us like royalty. The prices were very fair.
October 19, 2013|Warm friendly spacious|5|We go for the ambiance, the warm welcome and friendliness, the inventive modern menu. The food has always been fine, and now is better... New chef they say. With advance notice, they are wonderful about accomodating large tables and private parties. Beautifully eccentric and heartfelt decor
October 19, 2013|Great Ambience; Food uneven|3|Four of the 5 entrees were very good. The fifth, the veal chop special, was under-cooked for medium. Even after it was sent back for further cooking, it still came back undercooked. Great atmosphere. Very good service.
October 19, 2013|Eclectic food and decor|4|We had a delicious brunch. The bruschetta was some of the best I've ever had. The pizza and omelette were very good. The coconut shrimp was okay. The decor is a feast for the eyes. I would definitely go there again.
October 18, 2013|Eclectic decor and food & all good!|5|First time here and really enjoyed both the menu and the setting. Outdoor seating in the courtyard would also be lovely during warmer times. Located in a non descript neighborhood but certainly not the case inside where find a wide range of items on the walls and hanging from the ceiling. Went for dinner during Brown Family Weekend and will certainly return to try more dishes and drinks!
October 18, 2013|old and new|4|in the back streets of the city, factory district turned into fine dining also keeping the sense of history (antiques and wood beamed ceilings). Not so easy to find but part of the fun to go dine there. Eating where a city had grown up, factory buildings of red brick with granite stones, old style with ambience and well thought out food. Unusual and exciting.
October 12, 2013|Really enjoyed it!|5|Great food, great service. Will definitely be back!
October 6, 2013|nice, but not amazing|3|I found the food to be a B and not higher. with so many fine choices in RI, I will look elsewhere on my next visit. ambiance is very cool.
October 5, 2013|Excellent|5|This restaurant exceeding my expectations. My friend and I were seeing a show at PPAC and wanted to have a nice dinner beforehand. The food was beyond delicious (probably the best crab cake I've ever had) and our waitress was lovely. Within walking distance to the theater. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Providence!
September 29, 2013|Secret. Spot|5|A hidden place A surprise for sunday night! We had a birthday romantic celebration Food was wonderful
September 29, 2013|Awesome Brunch|5|We went for brunch, it was great. Very interesting decor, helpful staff and delicious food. Definite keeper.
September 27, 2013|Great time with my wife|5|Took my wide for her birthday. This is the second time we have been to CAV and love the place, the people, the atmosphere. The wait staff is VERY pleasant and took care in making sure we felt special. There are a few restaurants in Providence that tend to be stuffy. Almost like you should be honored to eat here. Not CAV. The food is first rate. CAV is up there in innovative and well thought out dishes. Everything is appropriately priced as well. Not over-priced. Wine list is excellent and again reasonably priced. highly recommend this restaurant. We will go back... I rate this very high because they truly deserve this.
September 21, 2013|Off the beaten path gem|5|While the walk to CAV from downtown Providence made all my friends doubt my choice for a dinner spot, their fears were allayed once we got to CAV and saw the great ambiance and decor. Food, drinks and desserts were great and our server was really nice. Will def come back when i'm in Providence
Dined on September 20, 2013|I consider myself a world-class|4|I consider myself a world-class expert on calamari, and these were by far the best I have ever had. I have had them twice. Tender, fresh, and flavorful.
September 17, 2013|The best meal in Providence|5|Believe me, this is the best meal in Providence. The eclectic interior of the restaurant is worth the trip. The wine list is exceptional, (the first time in any restaurant with a Rhone Valley selection that includes an affordable Gigondas). My wife and I ordered several appetizers so we could get a taste for the chef's ability. Crab cakes, Lobster, and cocoanut shrimp were nothing short of culinary art and exceptional. We opted to pair the Gateau Concorde and the Coconut Sorbet for dessert. Both were exceptional.
September 13, 2013|Nothing exciting here.|2|Boring menu, drab restaurant. My friend and I had chicken and both were dry.
September 1, 2013|Fantastic Gem!|5|We went to CAV for our first time on 9/1/13 with friends after a friend highly recommended it. She insisted we go there when I said we would be in Providence for the night. Well she did not steer us wrong. The food was creative and delicious. I had a mushroom risotto that was quite good. All 4 if us really liked the food. Service was great & did not rush us. The ambiance is quite interesting & eclectic because they sell the antiques on display, as well as the chairs we sat on & the tablecloths! I highly recommend CAV (stands for Cocktails, Antiques, Victuals)!
August 23, 2013|Very good service and a good meal|4|I ordered the shrimp and tomatoes and garlic and asked that it be served over polenta instead of pasta and they accommodated my request. Thanks
August 19, 2013|Outstanding!|5|This restaurant was AMAZING in every way. Creative menu, delectably excellent food, beautiful location. Can't recommend it enough! We will be back!
August 10, 2013|Lovely meal on 8-10-13|4|Staff here in this eccentric yet cozy restaurant are a key to this restaurant's success I'm sure. (The host even walked with us out to the sidewalk to explain walking directions back to our hotel after our lovely meal.) Add to that a tender calamari appetizer with peppers and a wonderfully made martini and your evening can't go wrong. First impressions are so important. CAV you had us at hello.
August 10, 2013|not the usual performance|3|Have dined at Cav several times and always thought food and service excellent (although menu does not change much) Took my brother 8/10/13 there when he was visiting from out of town; not crowded but our waiter had trouble with drink orders (only a table of three) and then forgot about the bottle of wine we ordered; when we reminded him he still didn't bring wine until we had finished entrée (we declined the wine at that point) Brother and wife had tuna which wasn't very good; Caesar salad wasn't made with romaine (?) Disappointing
August 2, 2013|What a wonderful night out!|5|Overall we had a great dinner at CAV. The food, service and surrounding were great, except I prefer it to be a little bit quitter. When we arrived, the restaurant was half full with just the right ambient (less noise). However, when the restaurant fill-up with people, the noise level had become a bit unbearable.
July 26, 2013|Dinner|5|Dinner was excellent from the appetizer to the entrees. Great wine selections also. Service was a 10, very accomodating
July 25, 2013|Eclectic menu and atmosphere !|5|We took some friends from the San Francisco area here for dinner. They were very pleased and one person said the scallops were the best he's ever had. Food is always delicious here and the menu changes often enough to keep it from getting stale. the atmospher is very eclectic as well with crystal chandeliers coupled with African art. I highly recommend Cav if you are in the area and do try the calamari. It is the best anywhere !
July 19, 2013|Restaurant Week|2|My dining guest & I were both disappointed in the portion size of the meals. I do understand that the menu is modified for Restaurant Week, but 4 thin slices of watermelon is ridiculous for a salad...especially when watermelon is such a cheap ingredient! The flavor profile was great, but only two bites worth! And one tiny scoop of a store bought sorbet was a letdown. Even a garnish of a few berries or mint leaf would have elevated the dessert and made it seem a bit more special. Restaurant Week is time for your establishment to shine, so diners will want to come back for more. This visit just left me hungry.
July 17, 2013|Pretty darn good|4|Finding or getting to the door was a little tough, but once inside my experience improved. The decor is fascinating and eclectic- I appreciated the combination of the antiques and the food. The wait staff was very attentive and the food was pretty good (I went for restaurant week). I really enjoyed my meal of the black truffle ravioli. My boyfriend got salmon, which he liked but felt the presentation was a little sloppy and the proportions of the food were a little off. There was no starch served with his meal and a heck of a lot of salad on the plate with little in it besides the arugula. However, the salmon was cooked very well. So, the food was delicious even if the proportions were a little off.
July 16, 2013|Lovely dinner|4|We had a lovely dinner during restaurant week. The food was prepared excellently and tasted delicious. The servers are very attentive. The ambiance is great, and we loved the decorations. I had the black truffle ravioli and my husband had the duck confit, and they were both wonderful.
July 13, 2013|It had been a number of years|5|It had been a number of years since we dined at CAV and were happy to go back. Very nice atmosphere with a lot of antiques and a very, very nice staff. The menu is quite extensive plus they had a restaurant week menu with 3 courses. My wife opted for the restaurant week menu and I ordered off of the regular menu. I had scallion dumplings for the appetizer and duck (a combo of duck breast and confit) for the main course. The waiter gave me a complimentary sorbet for dessert! All in all it was a great dining experience and we need to go back more often. I highly recommend CAV.
July 12, 2013|Restaurant week failure|3|Usually a great place but I will never go back when Restaurant Week. Poor dishes... Very small... Bad quality meat. Go to Mc Donald's first.
July 12, 2013|Dinner for two|4|Excellent service. Filet was perfectly cooked and dressed. Apps were outstanding.
July 12, 2013|Cozy and eclectic|5|I love the shabby chic/ ethnic decor. I have only attended for lunch, but the food is amazing and well priced. Staff is excellent.
July 10, 2013|Variable Depending on Order|3|Some of the dishes we had were delicious and some were just OK. The service was good, the server very nice and knowledgeable about the food and the history of the restaurant. Love the 'art gallery' style of decorating the space and shopping opportunity for unique items.
July 10, 2013|Wonderful place|4|I cannot believe I haven't been here before . It was so so good !! We had great service by Jennifer so much so we came twice in one week. The duck was amazing as was the pork chop. So worth it and now that I know they have brunch I will be back!
June 20, 2013|First time at CAV. We will|5|First time at CAV. We will definitly go back. Our waiter took the time to explain the history of the restaurant, the building. The menu hwa s a good variety of of options, but is not so large that it becomes to big for the diners or the kitchen. We are planning to taking a group of friends to dinner to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary, and CAV will be the place.
June 16, 2013|Father's day|5|I have loved CAV since it opened 20- something years ago! brought my husband and 16 year old twins for father's day and at first they didn't get the vibe, but now they talk about it, and want to go back! Cav is cool....
May 28, 2013|Great with friends|5|It's a wonderful place to go with friends. Servers never rush you, and the food is very good.
May 21, 2013|Not bad|3|The food is far from bad, but not terribly interesting and not prepared with extreme attention or refinement. The ambiance is pleasant but chintzy, and I found the service to be warm but remarkably inattentive.
May 17, 2013|We love CAV|5|We love CAV. Great food. Thoughtful and attentive service. Beautiful ambiance. Enjoy...be kind. There's lots of love in this place.
May 10, 2013|A hidden gem|5|Cav is a wonderful restaurant that is hidden in an alley. It provides a wonderful ambience with much to look at in terms of unusual art and sculpture. The food is excellent and the service was very good. I would highly recommend for romantic dining or going out with a large group.
May 9, 2013|Repeat Customer|4|CAV was recommended by the customer I was in town working with. I am glad I listened to them ! The restaurant itself is an eclectic mix of decor. What made me go back twice in one week was the food. The kitchen staff is getting the job done right. I wish I had a huge plate of that mushroom crostini appetizer right now ! Both the White Bean Shrimp Pasta and the Spinach Manicotti were very good. I will definitely go back to CAV if I'm in the area again.
May 4, 2013|Another great meal|5|My husband and I went to Cav for our 25th anniversary dinner. Having been there previously we were very pleased at the presentation of our meals as well as the flavor from appetizer to dessert. my husband says he thought it was the best meal he had ever had there. WE definitely will return and highly recommend it to anyone.
April 19, 2013|Neiborhood Gem|4|The food was great. The bartender fantastic, really new his drinks and service at the bar was exceptional. The service at the table for dinner could have been better, waiter did not know the menu very well and his wine knowledge was poor. The man who greeted us at the door is a gem. He made us feel welcome and was eager to make our night special. He is one the reasons we will return.

April 6, 2013|This restaurant is a gem!|5|This restaurant is a gem! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The decor is ecclectic with lots of chandeliers and Aisan collectables, comfy sofas and chairs, brick walls & wood floors. Feels like your dining in someone's home and not a restaurant. Wait staff is incredible! Attentive, knowledgeable, and great personalities. Then, there is the owner, Silvia. She came to our table to introduce herself and ask about our experience. Lovely and sweet woman. No wonder she has a successful busines, great food, great staff, gorgeous decor and impeccable service. My new favorite place in Providence.
April 5, 2013|The CAV resturant experience|4|The CAV resturant experience was wonderful. However the Open Table reservation experience was not so wonderful. A friend arrived before me and was told there was no reservarion under my name. When I asked the wait staff about this the reply was that the open table computer generated reservation was not reliable . They suggested calling the resturant to make reservations.

March 30, 2013|Creative entrees and wonderful art.|4|What an interesting restaurant! Dinner and art lecture in one. Wonderful primitive art adorns the walls and the owner was happy to discuss her collection at some length. The appetizers that we had were okay (bruschetta was very chunky and Caesar salad was a little dry). The pasta with lobster was also just ok, but two of our entrees (pumpkin ravioli, chicken w/pears) were outstanding. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was balanced with sweet, cooked pears and chive dumplings. The pumpkin ravioli included the flavor of pistachios and went nicely with the chicken as well. We were really impressed with the creativity of the chef's dishes.
March 16, 2013|We had a really nice brunch|5|We had a really nice brunch at CAV - very quiet even though there was a baby shower not far away, and our omelette and crab cake entrées were very good. The service was attentive but not intrusive, and the high ceilings, big windows, and interesting items peppered all over the dining room made for a really pleasant ambience.

Dined on March 10, 2013|My friends and I stumbled|4|My friends and I stumbled upon CAV during a trip to Providence. It was the greatest find! Tucked away in an unassuming but picturesque courtyard was this magical place. Filled with stunning chandeliers and eclectic bits and pieces, we were mesmerized the minute we walked in. It didn't stop there. The service was spot on, the menu was expansive and divine and every bite was a bit of heaven. I'd recommend the French toast and the pistachio crusted crabcake with poached eggs.
March 9, 2013|We love CAV. My boyfriend|5|We love CAV. My boyfriend and I had our first date at CAV, and we return every year to celebrate. The food is always outstanding as is the service. We were there on a Saturday night, which was very busy! Despite the restaurant being full, we received our food very quickly, and our server was outstanding. I'm thinking we should go more than once a year!
March 3, 2013|Appetizer pizza, calamari|4|Appetizer pizza, calamari and crab cake were all excellent. Lamb shank special was very tender and tasted great. Lobster special, lobster over pappardelle, and mussels arrabiata got good reviews from our dining companions. On scallop and shrimp entree, scallops were cooked perfectly, but shrimp was overdone. Creme brule had good carmelization, but custard was very watery.

February 14, 2013|Fantastic Food, Great Atmosphere|5|The rare tuna was fantastic, literally melting in my mouth. Coupled with the bit of wasabi paste and the wasabi aioli, it was like having the best of seared, crusted tuna with sushi at the same time. The fresh pickled cucumbers and carrots were also quite refreshing. For desert, with Creme Brulee out, the chocolate Gateau was a superb standin. As for atmosphere and service, impeccable. All of the staff was attentive and polite, even when just walking by the table. On the downside, the particular table we had was next to a raised platform by the entrance with another table just about directly over us. Not so close as to feel like we were part of the same table, but close enough to feel crowded and overhear each other unintentiona

January 11, 2013|A great restaurant in Providence|5|CAV's moderately priced menu is extensive and unusual. In fact, it was really hard to choose--and the food was generally as good as the menu made it sound--or even better. (The lobster appetizer is great, and reasonably priced, too.) And the wine list, while not so extensive, provides an excellent complementary selection. My husband and I are not normally dessert people, but we found the dessert menu as intriguing as the main menu, and the two desserts we ordered did not disappoint. (Try the creme brulee; it's wonderful.) Finally, our server, Mike, provided helpful and attentive service without being overbearing; and the ambience is delightful. This is a great restaurant!

Our waiter was great, the noise level...even at full capacity, was perfect and the food was absolutely delicious!

To top of the dinner, the tiramisu and coconut sorbet were just wonderful. We look forward to maybe trying their brunch next time!

December 2, 2012|A fun spot for brunch|4|"My daughter and I had brunch at CAV on a Sunday morning. She had the french toast - nice thick slices, very satisfying. I had the pasta florentine, which was very good (though not outstanding) - just wish there were a bit more. The salad we shared had a wonderful roasted onion dressing, which the server kindly provided a side of, so that we could dunk our bread and finish it up. The server was very attentive, and the room is a delightful mix of ""antiques"" from ""exotic"" ports of call. It's not up there with the best food available in Providence, but it is many slices above the standard corporate fare, and it's a fun place. There is also plenty of parking. We'll return."

I thought the atmosphere was great, very ecclectic. I considered having my birthday dinner here, but i think i will go with another restaurent.
October 24, 2012|Always exceptional|4|We love the CAV. On this occasion we had family from California visiting Providence for their first time. My brother-in-law is an exceptional cook and a real foodie. When we arrived at the front door, we were told to go around to the side door, as the main section of the restaurant had been reserved for a private party. We entered a small room with only a few tables. My immediate thought was that this is not a good sign. But, to my amazement, the room turned out to be just what our visitors were looking for. It was quiet, even though there was a part of about 12 in the room also. The food was exceptional. My brother-in-law stated that his scallops were the best he has ever tasted. The service was beyond exceptional.
October 21, 2012|Quite impressed!|5|Outstanding food preparation, attention to detail, flavor. Really nice pairing on the sea scallop plate with subtle sesame, julienned snow peas, lobster butter and some of the best risotto i have ever had. Pasta Florentine, very nice, fresh, individually toasted. The filling is really nice. Wine list is not long, but great picks. We had a choice off the list and it was excellent! The only negative is the calamari was slightly undercooked; the small pieces were perfect, but the larger ones left breading in the center undercooked. The scallops were slightly undercooked as well, but I let that slide. The bill was completely reasonable for the meal and my first year anniversary date and I left very happy.
Dined on October 19, 2012|Always a treat|4|CAV is always a treat, especially the decor and the food. Our meals were very good as were the Martini's The night we were there the restaurant was packed. Even on such a busy evening, our server was excellent in trying to keep up with all the tables in his section that included some large parties. During it all, he remained very pleasant and professional. We are returning to the CAV tomorrow evening with a party of six, four of whom are visiting for the first time from California.

October 14, 2012|What a great place! I was|5|What a great place! I was in Providence for business and was dining alone. Sometimes that can mean that the service is poor and the table is bad. While the restaurant had plenty of open tables, I appreciated that none of them would have been a bad choice. The decor is funky but warm (tapestries, African art, chandeliers, exposed brick). The waiters were great - down to earth and knowledgeable about their menu. The food was excellent. Prices were reasonable. If I lived in Providence I would go back often.
October 6, 2012|Unique! Wonderful rich ambiance|5|Unique! Wonderful rich ambiance with low lighting, much of it provided by antique chandeliers, rugs draped all over the place, huge antique-y mirrors hanging on walls and ceilings (!), and fabulous art pieces and lamps from Asia and Africa and America. Good Italian food as well. Hard to beat that!

September 21, 2012|A Perfect Meal|5|This is the second time we have been to the Cav. The first time was perhaps eight years ago. It was as delicious as we remembered...perhaps even better. The service was outstanding and the food was perfect. My husband had the scallops and gave me a taste and we both agreed that they were by far the best we have ever had. They know how to cook seafood!!! I had the seared sushi-grade tuna. Superb! My college-aged daughter loved her goat cheese risotto. It was a perfect evening!
September 11, 2012|Great Value off the Beaten Path|5|Wonderfully eclectic atmosphere sprinkled with African and Asian artifacts. Food was superb and reasonably priced given the quality. Good beer selection on tap. Wine selection was a bit limited but we found what we wanted and those prices were reasonable too. This was a business dinner and everyone was very pleased with the selection, atmosphere and service.
August 24, 2012|Overall it was good...try it out|3|The service was questionable at first but Jen made it up to us with a round of drinks. After that eveything went else went rather smoothly and my party and I enjoyed ourselves for our first time. The food was good and the menu was very intriguing and well balanced. Although the food was good, there were some flaws. My mom's duck was a little dry and I felt as though the risotto could've been a tad creamier. The other folks in my party enjoyed their dishes as well. I would be back to give it another go and I would recommend it to others. We also had the chance to eat in the small courtyard and that was great but it could use another light or two.

August 3, 2012|CAV is just ok|3|CAV is located in a deserted area near the highway. The entrance is set off down a little hill. The decor is unique reminescent of the 19th century. It did look a little dusty and damp to me. However, it is repleted with art objects and sculptures. There are a few african sculptures and I thought I saw a christmas chariot up in the ceiling. There were some other arts in display. The ambiance was more like romantic. They even dimmed the light after 6 PM. There were a lot of couples in there. I picked the catch of the day which happened to be trout. The food was delicious and served with vegetables. I thought the portion was reasonable. The service was slow, unattentive and our waitress was condescending. In resume, I thought it was ok.

They decorate it with Asian and African Artifacts which you can purchase and each table has a different beautiful table cloth on it. The food is always cooked to perfection and the service is perfect not to hovering just enough attention. We brought some friends visiting from out of town they loved it! You have to go just to see how artistically it is decorated. I haven't been to the brunch yet.

The waitstaff didn't come to our table until after 10 minutes when we went to the host and inquired. The food okay. I ordered the scallops which were extremely salty. We also ordered dessert which was average. I don't think that we will return.
June 8, 2012|We're regulars...Bravo CAV|5|The food at CAV is always creative and outstanding. The attention to detail is exceptional. The owner is a gracious and lovely person- and she has invested in making sure her people are the right people and that their service values mirror hers.

May 12, 2012|Great outdoor dining with|4|Great outdoor dining with an urban feel. Beautifully decorated and lighted. Just watch hot for the noisy 'regulars'. We had a nice dinner with a great wine from the relatively short wine list. A large group showed up and dragged tables and chairs around, extremely noisily, pretty much ruining the mood. No Ione on staff attempted to stop or quiet the group
May 11, 2012|Lovely to look at, lovely to savor|5|Excellent from start to finish. Such an exotic environment that, even if you were to run out of conversational topics with your dining partner, you wouldn't be bored: so much to look at! The best bruschetta in my vast bruschetta experience, and every other morsel was delicious as well.

Unfortunately, this time we were sat in a far corner this time, and our server did not find his way over to us as often as we would have liked. The food was also less amazing than I remembered-- the brie and the asparagus with a poached egg were lacking in flavor. Still, I would go again, as the menu has great potential and the restaurant itself is a quirky experience.

March 10, 2012|We love CAV. The ambiance|4|We love CAV. The ambiance alone is worth a visit. The food is excellent. The shrimp scampi is incredible. I could live on the sauteed mushrooms. Only two criticisms. One is that there is some variability in the food quality. We went on consecutive Saturday nights and there was a notable difference. Calamari was perfect the first night (best we've ever had, and we order it at every restaurant!) but the second night it was a bit overdone. The portion size on the mushrooms varied a lot between nights. The other thing is the lobster bisque. We were warned that it is sweet but we weren't prepared for HOW sweet it is. It's dessert sweet. Sweeter than many pies I've had. None of us were able to eat it. Terrible.
March 6, 2012|I love CAV. My boyfriend and|5|I love CAV. My boyfriend and I met there, and we went back for our 1st anniversary. It's very romantic, and the food is fantastic. I don't think we'll be able wait until our next anniversary to go back!

It was only at the urging of one of our party that we prevailed upon the greeter ( To call him a maitre d would be too complementary) that they were persuaded to put two small tables together and were finally seated nearly 30 minutes after arriving. The poached eggs in their variation on a holland arise theme were hard boiled and therefore indelible. It is a lovely space, if a bit overdone, but the waitstaff does not live up to its pretensions. There are better places to eat in Providence, despite the self-promotion that the owne
February 11, 2012|Outstanding!!!|5|Fantastic place. All the art hanging on the walls is really cool. The meal was above and beyond great. This is a great spot for a date night or group dinner. I would recommend this place in a heart beat.
February 11, 2012|CAV- be my valentine|4|We regularly dine at CAV and decided to go the Saturday night before Valentine's Day- I was a little worried as EVERYONE seemed to be out on the town that evening. The place was packed- but the service was exceptional as always, our food was great and we really enjoyed it. I was impressed that they handled the booked to capacity crowd so well.

February 10, 2012|Win some, lose some.|4|first time i ever went here was stupendous. everything was perfect. That visit i had the seared tuna. It was heavenly, and the goat cheese croquettes were amazing. this visit i got the seared tuna salad. the tuna was good, not fabulous. the salad was WAY over-dressed. My daughter got the seared tuna and it was nowhere near as nice a piece of fish as i had had last visit... not bad, just not fabulous. The lobster appetizer WAS fabulous, however, and overall it was a good meal.

February 4, 2012|Appetizers, dinner and dessert|4|Appetizers, dinner and dessert were all delicious! Very nice, romantic atmosphere. Very much enjoyed our dining experience.
February 4, 2012|Memorable birthday|4|Our party of nine was given a table at back where we could socialize with each other without feeling we were overwhelming neighboring diners. Those among us who had never been to CAV were wowed by the interior decorating. We all enjoyed our food. Those who'd driven 2-3 hours for the occasion, were not disappointed. All in all, CAV helped us provide a delightful, memorable birthday dinner for my 83 year old mom.
January 31, 2012|just whatever|2|OK ... heard a lot about Cav and took my mother there for her birthday. Made a reservation on Open Table and referenced this when we arrived on time. A day later and we're still pending. Plus, in the reservations I said it was a birthday dinner ... I don't even think it was read. So ... the coconut shrimp was frozen from a bag and served in an old and nasty coconut shell. I swear my mashed potato was instant ... couldn't be, but it sure looked and tasted. The brie cheese starter was served with Pepperidge Farms crackers, no imagination, so many places do nice toast points or something. The food was not that good and they were even still pushing the Dinner Week menu even though the week was over. Not going back. But, the service is polite.

January 27, 2012|Definitely not vegan friendly|2|Our first impression was pleasant when we saw the nice decor/atmosphere, however that was the highlight of our dining experience that went down from there. After we got our menus, we realized that the menu we saw online, and had used in choosing which restaurant to pick for our night out, was not the current menu. When we asked our waitress if we could have the bruschetta without feta cheese, she said it wasn't possible and didn't offer to check with the kitchen to see what they could do despite the fact that it was around 6:30pm and not yet busy. Despite knowing that we were hoping to pair the bruschetta with a salad as a dinner for one of us, instead of offering to serve a larger salad, we got a large plate and a side salad.
January 26, 2012|CAV is a safe, not spectacular, bet|3|CAV is dependable - food was good, and service was friendly - though never impressive. In our recent visit during Restaurant Week, I was surprised and less than thrilled that the entree was served before we were done with our salads. Service here has always been ok, but nothing to write home about.
January 25, 2012|We've been wanting to go to|2|We've been wanting to go to CAV for a really long time and Restaurant Week seemed like the perfect excuse. When we arrived the place was fairly empty so we were seated quickly. The rest of the service was painfully slow. The place was not packed, yet it literally took almost an hour to get our entrees. That kind of pace is unreasonable for lunch in the middle of the week. We also never got any kind of explanation. The food was okay, but certainly not worth waiting for. We took our desserts to go since we were cutting it close to 1.5 hours and we had to go back to work. Overall, hugely disappointed since it looked promising.
January 25, 2012|I love CAV. I took my friends|4|I love CAV. I took my friends during restaurant week.The frittita was overcooked and the taco had fried fish instead broiled. My pumpkin ravioli was outstanding. THE service was slow for lunch time.The atmosphere was warm welcoming and eclectic. I would finally go back again.
January 20, 2012|CAV is a very nice restaurant|4|CAV is a very nice restaurant with excellent service. We went on a Friday night during restaurant week and it was busy but the service was GREAT! The waitree was very friendly, the food was yummy, and the wine selections are great. They don't have a lot to choose for cocktails, but they make it up in wine. It's a bit pricey so I wouldn't recommend it to those that are budgeting. Great for birthdays, anniversaries, or a girls night out.

We were there for a surprise graduation/birthday dinner and took advantage of Providence restaurant week (we live in CT). The food was delicious, the service gracious, the setting unique, romantic and cozy all at the same time, and two visits from the owner were very enjoyable. We have already recommended it to friends and feel like we found a real gem! Would definitely go back even just for a drink/food at the bar. We loved it on all counts!
January 15, 2012|Beautiful, warm and charming|5|We went for our anniversary dinner - not only was the food delicious, and the service excellent, but they also gave us a complimentary round of champagne. This was a delightful place, and I look forward to going again!

January 8, 2012|This was only my third visit|5|This was only my third visit to CAV and my second visit for brunch. We arrived a few minutes before our 1 p.m. reservation and the place was packed. It’s nice to see a restaurant busy. We waited just a few moments as a party left and a table was cleared and set for us. I had the Maryland crab cake and it was outstanding. It was quite a rich dish and even though I came to CAV starving I had trouble finishing it all. The crowd is a great mix of couples, families and large parties of friends. I can certainly see why this is such a popular brunch spot. Don’t forget to order a mimosa!
January 4, 2012|CAV - A Must Try!|4|Though the portions are small, the food at CAV is always fresh, creative, and most importantly, delicious. The eclectic design, tapestries, art, and chandeliers (basically a museum inside) creates a unique and very interesting atmosphere
December 31, 2011|Fantastic restaurant off the|5|Fantastic restaurant off the beaten path in Providence. A great attitude from all the staff, from the host, to the waitstaff and bartenders, combined with innovative and perfectly-executed food, set amongst an eclectic selection of antiques, leads to a wonderful dining experience. Highly recommended.
December 31, 2011|I have been to Cav several|2|I have been to Cav several times, and this is the first time that I have been disappointed. We had the baked brie for an appetizer and it came with what were obviously Pepperidge Farm crackers. The lobster bisque was so dominated by the vanilla that it tasted more like melted ice cream than soup. Lastly, the sauce for my ravioli entree was congealing by the time it was served to me.
December 31, 2011|Excellent!|5|We went to Cav on New Years Eve. I usually try to avoid restaurants on this night because there's usually a set menu and even a great place will turn lousy because of the rush. Not the case here. If you've never been, Cav is one of the prettiest places to dine in Providence. We were a party of 8 and were sat right on time for our reservation (I was expecting to have to wait because of the holiday). The service was good and the food superb. My husband and I split the massive crab cake. Others in our group raved about their apps as well. I had the seared scallops and my husband had the chicken. A friend had the shrimp scampi. There wasn't a complaint to be had. Cav is a bit pricey, but I'll be back for sure!

December 10, 2011|A HIdden Gem (but not for long)|5|Some friends and I stumbled upon this place and hadn't heard anything about it... I am sad that more providence foodies aren't raving about this place though. If you want a great brunch and do not want to wait for Nick's on Broadway...I have the perfect solution. CAV!!!!! Incredible service and exceptional food quality...for brunch it is a must! Portions are sizable so don't think ordering one thing is not enough food. I must recommend the french toast a la cav (siggy dish, phenomenal taste)
November 22, 2011|Great atmosphere, and fun|5|Great atmosphere, and fun environment with all the decorations. Lunch options were great. Had the daily special - Salmon on a Bulkie Roll, French Fries. It was great, very tasty. Quiet atmosphere, and great for continuation of your morning business meeting over lunch.

November 12, 2011|Probably about the worst service|3|"Probably about the worst service we have had in an ""upscale"" restaurant in years. Scallops and steak, excellent. The rest so,so. Dried up and small coconut shrimp. Two small shrimp for $5. Waiter recommended calamari! But never brought it. Never asked about wine, when I finally tracked him down, We were halfway through the entre before it came?? Should have known. Two reviews said the service was slow. I didn't know how sloooooooooow. If Gordon Ramsey comes here when in Providence. He should come back again, and do a waiter seminar."
November 11, 2011|It's been a while since I've|3|It's been a while since I've dined at CAV and perhaps my memory was better than reality. CAV is a pretty interesting place with an eclectic display of antiques. It's a tight spot and the trek to our table had us bumping into chairs everywhere. Service was attentive at first but, as the night got busier, it was more difficult to get our server's attention. The food was good. The menu sounded amazing and the dishes we ordered were very good but they weren't amazing, if that makes sense. Would we go back? Probably, but not as a first choice.
October 31, 2011|Have eaten there many times|4|Have eaten there many times - consistently excellent food. Service can be slow. Atmosphere is terrific. The owner is always present which is nice.

This time around the shrimp scampi was a bit overcooked and the mushroom risotto had a bit too much garlic or onions but the atmosphere is great, menu is interesting, and service is knowledgeable and attentive.

Dined on October 24, 2011|Let's begin by saying that|4|Let's begin by saying that we went on a Monday night so the restaurant was very quiet. Fortunately/unfortunately the restaurant is located in an area where you would not expect to find a restaurant, which I believe adds to the restaurants allure, but will certainly limit patrons to those that know that they want to go there. Appetizers were fantastic. Mussels were extremely flavorful and well prepared. The dumpling was tasty, but a bit doughy. Our entrees were terrific (sea scallops/shrimp and filet mignon)as they were both quite tasty and the presentations were great. The ambiance is the real reason why you would want to eat here. The setting is that of an old antique store and much of the decor, by the way, is for sale. A must try.
October 22, 2011|AMAZING FOOD & WONDERFUL SETTING|5|We took our daughter and several friends for dinner last Saturday to celebrate her birthday and it was great! Everyone raved about their meals, from the appetizers through to the desserts. The scallops were incredible. The server was friendly and efficient (especially given that there were eleven of us) and very accomomdating. Great wine list too! We will definitely make a return trip to CAV the next time we're in Providence.

We were seated and the service (our server Jennifer was outstanding) was exceptional. As we were celebrating my wife's birthday CAV did not recognize in any way our celebration. I attribute that to the crowd as mentioned above. Thank you.

The restaurant was not busy, as we were in on the later side with a party of 11. Our server was knowledgable and pleasant, but inattentive. Our first round of drinks took at least 20 minutes. Then we could see her talking at the bar while our second round sat there waiting for her to finish her conversation. We had no intention of being there for 3 1/2 hours as we waited for courses. Pick up the pace CAV!
September 16, 2011|We love CAV|5|"CAV is our ""go to"" choice whenever it's just the two of us or we are entertaining. The food is creative and always exceptional.
