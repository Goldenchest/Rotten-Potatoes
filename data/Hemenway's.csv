ays ago|Special Night|5|We celebrated our 40th anniversary last week at Hemenway's. We were escorted to a nice table with scattered rose petals and treated to champagne. Several staff members congratulated us including the manager. Our server Diane was personable and attentive. The lobster bisque was delicious and the calamari was done to perfection. My swordfish was moist and my husband's seafood pasta was tasty and full of treasures from the sea. I am glad I had room for the Blondie dessert as it was a great ending along with good coffee. We truly had a great night.

I had a swordfish sandwich, which was an open-faced sandwich with perfectly grilled swordfish, arugula and tomato. The staff at Hemenways is always helpful and although our waitress brought me the wrong vegetable, the one I got was delicious, so I didn't mind.

The food was amazing! And Trevor our waiter was amazing! I have a scallop allergy and multiple staff members came up to me double checking everything I was having was ok. They went above and beyond the call of duty. The meal was out of this world and my friend can't wait to come back to Rhode Island to come back here!
February 20, 2016|Birthday dinner, Sat. 2/20/16|5|Went for my sister's birthday, four sisters together. The food was very good, the drinks were very good, no complaints at all by any of us. Oysters and Littlenecks were so fresh, we would definitely go back. It was loud, but we were lucky we got a window seat at the end of a row so no noise on one side of us. It was a Saturday evening so the noise was expected. The service was excellent, so sad I can't mention the woman's name, I forgot but she was great even though she was so busy. Would highly recommend. And will return.
February 20, 2016|The epitome of excellence in a dining experience!|5|My boyfriend and I went for dinner on 2/20/16 and although we could only get a reservation at 4:15 p.m. we decided it was okay to have an early dinner. Our waiter was Ian and he was very professional, attentive to our needs without being intrusive, and at the end of the meal brought my boyfriend a complimentary dessert as I had told him the dinner was for his birthday in the following week. The ambiance of the restaurant is upscale dining with a twist of professionalism while coupled with a flair for courteous service making the customer feel as though they are there to be served! The food is beyond comparison. We ordered different items to sample the flair of the chef's ability to provide the palate with different tastes and everything surpassed our greatest expectation. Some may think the prices are high but if you think about the price in comparison to the service and the quality of the food you receive, the prices are modest in comparison to some eating establishments. I know we will go back but when depends on where we are at any given time. I just want to give a special thank you to Ian. I have eaten at five-star restaurants across the country in the last 25 years and Ian is the best waiter I have ever had the pleasure to have attend my table. Thank you!

February 18, 2016|Very good business dinner|5|We utilized Hemenways as a destination for our business dinner and we are very glad we did. The service was excellent. Our server, Shelia, was attentive, friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive. The food was excellent and the noise level was perfect. We didn't have to shout to be heard amongst ourselves. Everyone in our group was impressed with the meal and the restaurant as a whole. We will definitely be back.

The daily fresh fish choices were amazing. You cannot go wrong, either at a table or dining at the bar or the shellfish bar....its all good!
February 14, 2016|Great night out!|5|We had a wonderful meal and our server Allie was attentive, professional and just fantastic. What a great meal and night out with our family. We can't wait to go back!

February 13, 2016|They did a great job on a busy V-day weekend.|5|"The food was amazing! The service has always been great and remained so. But the chefs have upped their game. The food has taken on a creative & native touch. I had a great ""RI chowder"" and a simple white fish that was nothing short of amazing. Simple did not mean plain when presented for dinner. i normally do not have dessert but this time the personal sized homemade Key Lime pie felt like it was made just for us. It felt like we had a very special Valentines dinner with a personal server and cook just for us, instead of being another set of people on a busy night."

Out waitress was so attentive even though the restaurant was very busy as it was a Saturday night. The food came out it was presented so beautifully, almost to good to eat. It was much more then I had anticipated getting for food. I dined on the Lobster Mac and Cheese and my husband tried one of the specials of the night, the Veal . I look forward to going back to this restaurant again and trying something new or even having the same meal I had as it was excellent.
February 12, 2016|Great food and service|5|I have been coming to hemenway's since 2011 thanks to my wife who introduced me, NOT one single disappointing experience. Their seafood is always fresh(hint, hint.. We love seafood), all plates are cooked to perfection and the service is amazing, always going above and beyond.

It was the Friday of Valentines weekend so it was very busy. We had to talk loudly in order to hear each other. We come here often enough and will definitely come again!!!
February 6, 2016|Wonderful experience for all of us!|5|We were celebrating an important family event and Hemenway's was THE place to dine. Our server was attentive, but not obtrusive. The food was wonderful-from the lobster bisque and N.E. clam chowder, entrees of swordfish, rib eye, and the tuna, finishing up with the cream brûlée, key lime pie and chocolate dessert. We will be back! The restaurant was even able to accommodate special dietary requests.
February 6, 2016|We had company from NY and they just loved it!|5|We had company from NY for lunch and choose Hemenways because it is always consistently good. Well weren't disappointed. Our guests loved the restaurant and the food! We had the pre-fixed lunch menu with choice of soup/salad and entree and coffee and delicious cookies. We had plenty to eat, the food was hot and of great quality! Thank you!
February 3, 2016|Always a pleasure|5|You can always count on Hemenway's for a business lunch. They are professional and courteous to guests. Food is always great.
January 31, 2016|Absolutely wonderful!|5|I have been here before..always excellent. My friend and I went after PPAC. We got a series of apps and salad..scumptious...oh so good.
January 30, 2016|Service|4|Food and service are always excellent however service was very slow during this visit. The waitress did mention that they were working off a new menu. The manager came by to apologize for the food prep taking so long. This was appreciated.
January 30, 2016|I have been dining at Hemmingway's for o...|2|"I have been dining at Hemmingway's for over 20 years and when asked what my favorite restaurant is I've always responded with ""Hemmingway""s"". It has been a year or so since I have visited and much to my dismay it was not a pleasant experience this time. Arriving early for our reservation, we decided to get a drink and appetizer at the bar. The scallops and bacon we ordered was cold and the shrimp was a little limp. After settling our bill of $120.00 we were seated at our table. The four of us placed our orders starting with fried calamari which would of been delicious if it was warmer the just above room temperature. I ordered 3lb lobster with mashed and again my food was barely warm. Same with the others in my party. Our waitress never came back during our meal, not even with black pepper. This is the first time I have ever had a bad meal at Hemmingway's. Not sure if I will be returning as I can spent my $420.00 and get better service at a number of restaurants in the city. I would also like to mention that our reservations were at 5pm so it was not very busy."

I complained to manager expecting him to ask the table to bring it down. Instead he found it ""amusing"". Ruined our romantic night"
January 28, 2016|AMAZING|5|I planned a trip to Hemenway's for my a date night for my parents. They enjoyed it and could not stop talking about how amazing it was. They cannot wait to go back for another romantic date night.
January 24, 2016|a sure value|5|everything was good. steamers: top-notch. chowder, bisque: yum. seafood salad: generous and fresh.
January 23, 2016|Special Occasion Made More Special|5|Four of us went to a Saturday lunch at Hemenway's to celebrate my marriage to my partner of 19 years - two brides, one mother, and one minister. The staff had arranged our table in a quiet, scenic corner, decorated table with rose petals, and provided complimentary sparkling wine! They congratulated us warmly and could not have been more friendly and accommodating - even in a snowstorm that meant that two of our anticipated dining companions couldn't join us. Food was delicious, service spectacular, ambiance ideal. STRONGLY recommend for LGBT-friendly establishment and special occasions.

January 22, 2016|Great Experience|5|Hemenway's did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I decided to try Hemenway's because of their Restaurant Week promotion and I am very happy we did. From the moment we arrived, the service was amazing. They checked us in, took our coats, and showed us to our seats. Our waiter was extremely friendly and very attentive. I informed him of my food allergy and he said he would speak with the kitchen and make sure my food was prepared carefully. I even had two other employees come over to our table and ensure me that I would be accommodated. We started with the sesame-seared yellowfin tuna and it was delicious. My only critique would be that the portion was very small, but we could taste the quality of the tuna... amazing! I would also recommend the seafood casserole and the salmon as entrees- both were delicious. Lastly, if you are a coffee drinker- try their coffee! It was very fresh and is presented in a french press which made for a great flavor.
January 20, 2016|Great service!|5|Food was excellent; it almost always is! Service was really excellent this time. No long waits but didn't feel pushed either. Perfect table in a corner where it was quiet so we could talk. Definitely enjoyed the experience.

January 18, 2016|Excellent service and ambiance. Food was excellent|5|Excellent service and ambiance. Our waiter was attentive, the food was very good and the pace between plate serving was perfect. Quiet enough to have a nice conversation.

January 15, 2016|Great food|5|The food was excellent and our server was friendly and nice. The New England chowder was the best I ever had thus far. The food was a little pricey but it was worth it! I would definitely go back again.
January 15, 2016|A little disappointed this time.|4|I love Hemenway's but I made the mistake of going during Restaurant Week so the service was simply not up to par. I told the hostess and the waitress that we were on a tight schedule, and we did manage to get out on time, but just barely. Our waitress was pleasant, but not very attentive. She didn't stay on top of the beverages; had to ask for refills on iced tea. Had to ask for bread for the table. Coffee was requested and never brought so we just left without having it. The food was good, but not stellar. I expect that was due to the huge crowds there for Restaurant Week as usually the food is amazing. The lobster bisque was awesome, as always.
January 15, 2016|Great restaurant week choice!|5|The dinning experience is always great there. The food is always wonder! Very good food portions. The service was impeccable! The waitstaff observed my dark colored suit, and asked if I preferred a blk linen napkin instead of the white one on the table to avoid any possible lint. Very attentive to our table the entire service.
January 14, 2016|a great all around seafood place|4|Food is great. Selection good. Not much simple seafood. Busy but easy to get a table.

All of us enjoyed the entree choices, grilled salmon, a perfect burger and scallops. We were also treated to yummy chocolate chip cookies for our dessert. Our waiter, Larry, was simply the best, so attentive, polite and very funny! We look forward to our next visit and it does not have to be restaurant week!
Dined on January 10, 2016|Great dinner|5|My husband and I had a wonderful dinner. We tried Heneways during Providence restaurant week and will definitely be back!
January 10, 2016|Pleasantly surprised|5|Hemenway's was a backup choice for Providence Restaurant Week when I learned another restaurant wasn't honoring the discount on Sundays. I hadn't heard much about this place, so it was a gamble at best. And we won! The meals were spectacular--wonderful tastes (such interesting combinations of flavors) and beautifully presented. Generous portion sizes, especially for their signature seafood casserole. Plenty to share around the table (and you MUST share--it's that good!) Desserts (chocolate mousse cake and creme brulee) and particularly smooth coffee were a wonderful way to end the meal. The whole experience was elevated by our wonderful and knowledgeable server, Morgan. She knows her menu AND the Providence (and greater Providence) restaurant scene. Such a pleasure to have her as our guide.
January 9, 2016|Wonderful Spot - A Providence Must|4|We've been coming here for 25 years and STILL love it. Great food, wonderful atmosphere, and reasonable prices. Ask for Bill as your server. He's an institution here and will guarantee you a fantastic experience!
January 4, 2016|Great spot!|4|I brought out of town family to this spot and we all had a great time and great food ! If you like seafood especially they have some great dishes. Ive always heard good things about this spot and now I know why. And to top it off you have a great view of the city!
January 3, 2016|Wonderful salmon special entrée elegantl...|4|Wonderful salmon special entrée elegantly presented with flavors that really blended well. Loved the lentils, too. Ahi grade tuna prepared to perfection, too. Half-priced wine night on Sundays a nice perk, too.
January 2, 2016|Food just okay - too peppery|3|Maybe it was the dishes we ordered, but we found our seafood to be over-seasoned and way too peppery on several levels. This includes the calamari, paella and the mussels. If I go back, I will order a plain seafood dish so that I could enjoy the taste of the seafood. Not sure if I will go back.
January 2, 2016|Pleasant surprise|4|"Nice setting, comfortable dining, great food and presentation. Front of the house professional and welcoming. Service did not match the rest of the experience. Waitress forgot our coffees, and refered to us a ""you people here"" ... Guess since she was not from this area did not feel connected to the local area. Polite and nice but not up to par. Would return......... Overall very impressive."
January 1, 2016|The food was good, nothing exceptional. ...|3|The food was good, nothing exceptional. The greeting was indifferent, the service ok. There was no feeling of doing or being anything special.

December 31, 2015|Fabulous as always|5|Hemenway's never disappoints. Staff that's friendly, efficient and always seems to know when to approach the table or give another moment or two. Food is always fresh and delicious. Seafood lovers and steak lovers alike will find something perfect at Hemenways.
December 27, 2015|Excellent|5|Excellent restaurant, i was searching for a while. Everything was perfect
December 26, 2015|Sara Bomberger|5|We were a party of 6 and it was my daughter's birthday. Our waiter was wonderful, he explained the menu and made our birthday girl feel special. Everyone in our party were totally satisfied with their choices they made off the menu. We will definitely go back again...haven't been there in years.
December 24, 2015|Extremely loud maitre'd stand and restau...|3|Extremely loud maitre'd stand and restaurant. We had an assortment from the raw bar and an antipasto plate, both good. Out of the 3 entrees we had 1 overcooked, the grilled pepper shrimp were very dry and kale was bitter. At 7:30pm already out of 1 1/2 lbs lobsters, had to jump up to 2 1/2 lb lobster! Made reservation through Open Table, Hemenway's said we never showed and we had to file a dispute to receive points. Staff we saw/dealt with was not on point tonight! We will not return.
December 24, 2015|Seafood Heaven|5|This is one of our favorite spots to celebrate special occasions. As always, the food was outstanding and the service was incomparable. From the greeting to the goodbyes, everything was *****!
December 24, 2015|Christmas Eve Revisited|5|This was our 16th time dining at Hemenways on Christmas Eve and this evening was no different than the others with great food and great service even though our wait person thought it was too slow. She was very attentive at all times and was very friendly. We were familiar with her from previous visits. We had great scallops, alaskan king crab and steak along with wonderful salads and other apps. My scallops were superb! The drinks were excellent. We will be back again soon because we can never wait just for Christmas Eve!
December 19, 2015|Another good meal!|5|We had a great meal and got to the game on time! One of the party has some food restrictions and he was informed of ingredients and accommodated very well. We shared an antipasto appetizer and we all had fish or shellfish for our main meal. Very fresh and everything tasted great. Nice variety on the menu.
December 18, 2015|Great Food and Great Service|5|A friend recommended this restaurant and I am so glad that I went. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. The lobster mac and cheese was amazing and very filling. The Rhode Island clam chowder was great and the filet was mouth watering. I give this restaurant a thumbs up and would highly recommend it.
December 18, 2015|Excellent Dinner Choice|4|Always a treat - food was amazing, and the service and ambiance second to none.
December 18, 2015|Lovely Holiday lunch!|5|We had a wonderful Holiday lunch for our department. Everyone enjoyed the food and the view. Our server was very good and we all had a great meal.
December 15, 2015|Going away party|5|Our waitress was the Best. Food was awesome as usual and the Classic Bubbles were awesome. Will definitely revisit when I come back to Providence.
December 14, 2015|Christmas lunch|5|We had a very enjoyable lunch on Monday @ Hemenway's. We were seated by a window which I had requested on OpenTable when I made the reservation. We were three long time girlfriends out to enjoy a pre-Christmas lunch together and everything was excellent. Service was just right, appetizers, entree, dessert, wine, it was all very, very good. Our server, Maura was excellent and added to the overall experience. I've been here several times and have always been satisfied. Liked it so much we made a reservation for Christmas Eve/day.
December 12, 2015|Always a wonderful experience.|5|It always impresses me that you get a dark napkin if you're wearing dark clothes (no lint). It's this attention to detail that makes Hemenway's stand out. Oysters are wonderful and there's a great selection. Not only is the fish good, but the steaks are as well. Cocktails are inventive and there's something for anyone - served in old champagne-like glasses. I only wish I could eat more!
December 11, 2015|Excellent pre-show restaurant.|4|"My sister and I need to find a restaurant for dinner prior to attending a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center. Providence is so great for walking now, that I was able to park my car behind the theatre, and we walked over to Hemenway's for a 5:30 p.m. reservation. Our waiter, Mikolai, was excellent. We enjoyed salads first which was fresh and hearty. My sister order the salmon which we loved. I ordered the yellow fin tuna. Mine was very good, but I wish there had been more in the plate for the price and less white rice. The wakame on the plate tasted ""off"", and I unfortunately experienced indigestion for it throughout the night and into the next morning. The tuna itself was excellent. Overall, I think Hemenway's is a great restaurant, and I would go again."
December 9, 2015|Great food and services!|4|I really enjoyed the surf and turf that our server suggested. The oysters were good, but not super great for the price. I'd recommend getting the oysters during happy hour or just ordering an appetizer instead. Overall, the server was very kind, and I enjoyed my experience there.
December 6, 2015|First time visit|5|First time visit because of a gift card. Wine prices on the high side. Service, food, and everything was great. I would go again for special occation
November 27, 2015|50th Anniversary Dinner|5|Hadn't been at Hemenway's for about 20 years---since I retired from Textron. But, when our best friends 50th anniversary came around and we were going to be in Providence I didn't hesitate to take them to Hemenway's for a special dinner. It was a special evening, food was wonderful as I had remembered it, the atmosphere the same, and the service sublime. Diane, our wait person was terrific and made our evening.
November 25, 2015|Great food|5|One of My wife's favorite restaurants, the food is always really good..
November 24, 2015|terrific food and service!|4|love hemenways!! the consistency of food and service is reassuring.
November 21, 2015|Disappointing...|2|The restaurant has a strange layout - no matter where you stand you are in someone's way. The food is expensive for the value. My meal was okay but mediocre isn't good enough especially for the cost. The service was poor. We ordered sparkling water - got served table water. Ordered wine. It didn't come, didn't come, didn't come. Had to remind the waitress to bring it. Too noisy - I couldn't hear the other people at the table. I won't be returning.
November 17, 2015|Random choice, great find!|5|Immediately recognized this restaurant was not new to the locals and a very popular place! We were greated pomptly and seated in short order. Very pleasant and knowledable staff. The two of us were on a business trip and visiting from the mid-west. I have tried many seafood places all over the country, this is clearly one of the best. The presentation alone for the lobster mac-n-cheeze was worth the visit! Both seafood entrees were perfectly prepared and delicious! Rarely, do I leave a restaurant without some disappointment, except here. Perfect meal, perfect atmoshphere, very classy and a shinning star in Providence. Look no further for great seafood!
November 16, 2015|As always a great meal.|5|This time we had a table of 8, all had a great meal, good service, fresh seafood, nice vibe.
November 16, 2015|Top Spot - never a bad meal|5|Hemenway's is my top spot in Providence for both corporate and personal dining when we are in the mood for seafood. Over the past 4 years I have entertained international guests at Hemenway's 20+ times and have not had a single complaint from anyone. The shellfish tower is both impressive and delicious. My guests have raved about it and look forward to their next visit to RI to have a chance to enjoy it again. The ambiance is nice and the restaurant is situated nicely in between the canal and the historical East Side. If you get a chance to dine here, ask for Nancy, she's tops in my book.
November 15, 2015|Lovely room and ingredients,  a few misses|3|This is a beautiful high end dining space in a modern office building on the river. Lovely place, lovely menu, interesting wine list. The menu was - as billed - heavily oriented to seafood, and yet of the three appetizers we had - a spanish themed antipasto, Portuguese clams, and scallops in bacon - the antipasto, which had no seafood, was the best. the entrees were all slightly off in a way that made them less fabulous - the surf and turf had great shrimp, but undercooked filet mignon; the skate was a nice piece of fish, but underbaked -the cornmeal dredge was pale and crunchy; the paella had 10 times as many peas as necessary. All could have been served hotter. dessert -creme brulee - was perfect. coffee, in a cute little French press pot, was barely warm. Really want to like this place better, because the menu is thoughtful and the quality of the ingredients was very very high.
November 14, 2015|Dinner on 11/14/15|3|The food was well prepared with very nice drink options. The oysters were excellent. The entree's were good but did not live up to the high price. Dessert was nice but ran out of of a few selections by 8:30 PM
November 14, 2015|Always great!|5|Another visit to Hemenways and another great meal! This time we had an event to attend and the server ensured we were out of the restaurant on time. Fresh fish and nicely prepared veggies. Can't beat it.

November 7, 2015|Great experience went here for my anniversary|5|My girlfriend and I went here for our anniversary and had an amazing time. They had rose petals on the table before we sat down and the wait staff and food was just fantastic. Would recommend to everyone a must go restaurant in Providence
November 7, 2015|B&B & Dinner|5|The Matre Dee gave us a table by the window with a view of the river. Th👍🏾NKS . Our waiter was Jayson and he was very helpful and knowledgable of wine 🍷. He recommend several bottles and we choose a bottle that, we truly enjoyed. The appetizers, & clam chowder was delicious. I had the swordfish and my wife had the fisherman's lobster and our tastebuds were DELIGHTED ❗️ We will be back ❗️ to TERIMANATE more wine 🍷 appetizers and entrees L😊L G😇D BLESS 💒

The Prix Fix Menu for Waterfire had excellent choices - the Salmon was excellent, as was the Sole. The waiter was very polite and approachable, anticipating the needs of my parents, both of whom have disabilities. He was kind, courteous and attentive. The 3 hour Valet Parking is also a plus. I'd recommend this restaurant for any Waterfire evening.
November 6, 2015|Delish|5|Lobster was too die for. Filet Mignon cooked perfectly. Calamari with a kick!!! YUM!

October 31, 2015|Luci|5|Highlight of our stay in Providence! Beautiful restaurant with a lovely view. The atmosphere was inviting and relaxing! The crab cake starter was fabulous! The clam chowder was so creamy & delicious! My entree was a lobster special which was stuffed with scallops & shrimp. It was so fresh and delicious. Ended with Creme Brûlée in three flavors, chocolate, butterscotch & mint! Unbelievably good!! Our waiter was outstanding as well!

October 25, 2015|Just a great spot!|5|My wife and I try to eat here at least once a week when we're in town...wonderfully fresh seafood, exceptional wine list and lovely service...

October 23, 2015|Awesome dinning experience|5|We made a last minute reservation at Hemingways for our 15th wedding anniversary. Our server Jessica was unbelievable she recommended a fantastic shamrock oyster from Prince Edward Island and a lovely Prosecco that paired perfectly. My wife and I shared the grilled littlenecks, as well as the bacon scallion wrapped scallops. My duck duo was cooked perfect medium rare, and my wife's sirloin and king crab surf and turf with the grilled sweet potatoes was outstanding. The evening ended with key lime pie and the chocolate gateau both fantastic Bravo chef Max. We will definitely be back again soon. The atmosphere was not too loud, we could hold a conversation without feeling like we were raising our voices to talk to one another. Both the hostess, and the floor manager, as well as our server were exceptional.

October 22, 2015|Great Welcome and Service for A Romantic Evening|5|Hemenway's did an outstanding job for celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. During the confirmation call for the reservation, the representative acknowledged my online comment regarding our anniversary and suggested rose petals on the table. Upon arrival, our server (Sheila) made the event even better. She was a tremendously fabulous service and was attentive throughout the evening. We also appreciated the manager's acknowledgement of my military service and my wife's service as a military spouse. To top off everything, the food was AMAZING! The evening could not have been any better.

Also and excellent Raw Bar with changing local selections. Top notch professional service and accommodating staff. A must stop dining experience in Providence.
October 21, 2015|Always Amazing|5|I try to come here every time I'm in Providence. I ordered the mussels for the first time and they were big and tasty. I also got the seafood bake, which was very creamy and rich. The mixture of scallops, shrimp, and fish was perfect.
October 20, 2015|lunch at Hemenways|3|Wonderful location and views. Server was very good. Lunch selection was salad with add on. Have had better..nothing special. Wine and coffee were very good. I was expecting a better dining experience.
October 18, 2015|Consistently good|5|The quality of food and service is consistently excellent...a regular dining destination for us...
October 17, 2015|Good college parent weekend spot|3|We had a nice dinner with our daughter. Easy walk from Brown and RISD. Good seafood salad. Good oysters. OK wine selection. Very good but not great.

October 16, 2015|Lovely!  Great food and better service!|5|I came with my family, including my 11 year old brother, and we all had an excellent time. The food was well prepared and creative, and all very good! Our waiter was really fantastic, and the staff was incredibly attentive and cheerful. It was a bit too pricey for me to go back all the time, but I would certainly go for special occasions!
October 16, 2015|Fresh and well presented|4|Friday evening meal before a show at PPAC. seated immediately, attentive service. Cocktails mixed well, the calamari appetizer was excellent. Our table enjoyed Paella, stuffed shrimp and salads. The food was fresh and well presented.

October 13, 2015|Great Experience!|5|We live in Boston but had family from out of town staying in Newport. We wanted to see them and decided to meet in Providence for dinner. Hemenway's did not disappoint! Everyone loved their dinners. I had the Georges Banks Sea Scallops without the accompanying smoked pork belly and it was fabulous! Among the highlights from my relatives' dinners were the Cherrystones, the Caesar salad, the Hemenway's Wedge, Lobster Bisque, Seafood Casserole and the Scallop Special that evening. The oysters were fresh and sweet, and mildly briny. The wine was wonderful, too. We were all too stuffed for dessert but the selections sounded great. Perfect meal!
October 13, 2015|2nd time was so bad...|3|My girl & I first met 7-months ago here, decided to return. So loud on Tuesday we could not hear each other at the table. Hors d'oeuvres included under-preparing the crab cakes. Dinner included salad dressing on the salad, when ordered on the side. Also y medium-well steak came to me burnt black, so bad I gave it to ny dog!!! We ordered two desserts, Apple was ok but their Key Lime pie made us both pucker so bad we left it alone. My girls a vegetarian so she asked why her pasta sauce tasted like it had meat in it; the host assured us the cook told him no ... but don't tell my hot blooded Puerto Rican girl that.. ... we will not be back for such a poor $130 dinner (she had club soda, I had water). I should not have left a twenty dollar tip, but the waitress was trying.. ... I always had lots of water, but it was food I needed after our 10 and 12 hour jobs that day!!! Hey, Hemenway, what about a free meal for that poor one????

October 11, 2015|Worth the Price|5|Everything was excellent. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. It's pricey but worth the experience.
October 11, 2015|Great food but......|3|Was so looking forward to this restaurant. My wife and daughter had gone the last time my wife was visiting my daughter (RISD). They raved about the food so we made reservations far in advance while visiting for family weekend. With the Open Table App, we changed the reservation time at least 3 times and had no problems. We arrived on time and were seated almost immediately. we were approached by our very friendly server and bread and water were provided as well as a kids menu for my 10 year old. There were a few things recommended to us including the calamari appetizer that was to die for. Unfortunately, it took at least 30 minutes after the appetizers for any of our entrees to come out. They were apologetic and offered dessert on them but if you have a ten year old you know how hard it is to have a lengthy down time at the table. We were very disappointed with that aspect of the service. All entrees came out eventually and were hot and delicious. It is because of this that we will try the restaurant another time we are visiting the area but we will not accept that type of service again.

October 10, 2015|Great Special Occasion Venue for Seafood Lovers|4|It was my daughter's 18 th birthday and she investigated seafood restaurants near her college . Hemenways was at the top of the search engines. Hemenways is a wonderful seafood venue and we sampled every aspect of seafood we could. Each dish was fresh and delicious.
October 10, 2015|Cold Broiled Lobster|3|The clams and the crab cakes were delicious and fresh. My sixty dollar lobster was served cold. The manager apologized and instead of a new lobster, they just reheated mine. The taste was less than satisfactory. The manager came back at the end and offered the two of us dessert for the trouble. We weren't going to get any, but we took him up on the offer. The bill came and we ended up being charged for one of the desserts. Didn't realize it until after we already paid. Our waiter, named Lucas, was terrific. After a big build up and a long ride, the experience turned out to be just ok. I expected more.
October 10, 2015|Food good, but overpriced and portions small.|3|I had high hopes for some great seafood while visiting family in Rhode Island. I ordered the sea scallops- the scallops themselves were very tasty and perfectly prepared, but the accompaniments where a bit odd- a few bits of very chewy pork belly and some popped popcorn thrown in, seems like they could do a bit better, especially for the price (mid 30s for entree).
October 10, 2015|Out of towner|4|One of the few up scale restaurants that serves Saturday lunch in Providence, we enjoyed the ambiance, including the view. The host staff (Nicole) enabled special treatment for a birthday celebration and was patient with our delay, which we appreciated. The menu affords lots of combinations and healthy choices. We were a little disappointed by the food - grilled swordfish might have benefited from a garlic butter - and our waitress spilled water and confused the salad order. Overall however, a very good time and well worth a visit.

October 3, 2015|Outstanding service!|5|Made reservations and noted extreme nut allergies for my special needs son. As soon as we got there, we were already notified that they will inform us of any orders that may have nuts. We were visited by three different staff member and the chef personally served our son. Food was outstanding as well! Other restaurants can take their cue from Hemenways!
October 3, 2015|Birthday Celebration|1|We celebrated my wife's birthday with a nice relaxing and enjoyable dinner at Hemenways. The food was excellent and despite a full house our waitress Nicole was outstanding. She was very attentive to helping us through the menu and daily specials. We were not rushed and the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely a return trip is a must.

The clam chowder and crab legs are fantastic. The ahi tuna and sole were very good but not on-par with other menu items. Definitely one of my new go-to spots!

September 26, 2015|Not Impressed|3|Booked this restaurant for a Romantic Dinner Reservation. After notifying the Restaurant of the special occasion, we hoped to be recognized, but nothing was done. It felt like another ordinary date night. Highly recommend this place for lunch, it's not a place you would go with your significant other, but rather to conduct a business meeting.
September 26, 2015|Not as good as I remembered|3|We ate at Hemenway's several years ago and were looking forward to going back this trip. Unfortunately it was not as good as we remembered. The clam chowder was excellent but my tuna entree was just ok - don't think we will be going back.
September 26, 2015|FIRST TIME, WON'T BE THE LAST!|5|AMazing food, I chose the restaurant at random because it was close to waterfire. Well that evening they even had a dedicated waterfire menu, where for $35 you could choose from 3 different salads, 3 main courses, and 2 desserts! I got a ceasar salad, they brought fresh warm bread and butter, then I had the surf n turf....a large steak with a few pieces of jumbo shrimp, mashed potatoes with cornand cooked to perfection! Dessert was a ricotta cheesecake, which might sound heavy. But it was light amd fluffy with a graham cracker bottom and esprssso syrup.....amazing. I wish I could rremember my servers name, because she was amazing. She told us all qbout waterfire, it was our first time and was knowledgeable about the menu, courteous and prompt. She was a joy and genuine. Loved every moment, left stuffed and happy!

September 20, 2015|Phenomenal experience|5|We had seafood which was cooked to perfection. Never has such tender swordfish. The views were beautiful. Service was excellent,
September 19, 2015|Beautiful spot be the river|4|We had a great dinner here. When we arrived, we asked for a table by the windows overlooking the river and we were able to get one which was nice. Our waitress, Nichole, was so nice and very efficient. My only complaint is that something must have happened in the kitchen because it took almost an hour for our entrees to come out. We were sitting for almost 2 hours which a long time, but I'm sure these things happen.
September 19, 2015|Ordered broiled sword fish and received ...|4|"Ordered broiled sword fish and received ""steamed"" swordfish. It appears to have been boiled, was not hot and we were confused but didn't want to complain. After reviewing, we should have returned it but didn't. Not sure I have ever seen steamed swordfish."
September 18, 2015|One of my favorites!|5|I cannot say enough about Hemenways! I love the atmosphere and the food! The fact that it is part of the Newport Restaurant Group makes it even more desirable because you are able to use reward points. Our server was Theresa and she was awesome! Great service! Always our go to place for dinner or brunch!
September 16, 2015|was a wonderful experience|5|i brought my mother her for a nice evening out and it met our expectations. Alaskan king crab legs were delicious.
September 16, 2015|You can count on it|5|Reliably good food and service can always be found here. I have never had the luck of such perfect evening weather that we could sit outside in Sept. before. Not too hot or too cold and it was so pleasant to be set back from the sidewalk in our own little area. Our waiter was very helpful in making choices and accomodating our schedule. Hemenways is a favorite.

September 11, 2015|Outstanding food and service|5|The service from our waitress was as good as I have had anywhere. Our meals were excellent. I would highly recommend this place.
September 9, 2015|Great food, service|5|Aside from the obvious, our waiter really took the time to make sure we were taken care of, and the little things made a huge difference -- like bringing a cup of ice to keep my cocktail cool to comping our appetizer when he found out we were visiting from Texas and wanted us to get a true taste of New England. Food was excellent as well, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to any of my friends or colleagues.
September 7, 2015|Former Glory|2|I've eaten at Hemenway's many times previously with rave reviews for food and service but this time was a disappointment. The pan fried sole was overdone and dry, the succotash not flavorful. The tonic in the G & T was bland; the diet coke wasn't diet. Our server told us about 1 special while the server at the next table offered 3, and he splashed me with water (table was wrought iron or else the table would have caught the splash). He brought my wine before dinner when I asked for it to be served with dinner. These are not fatal errors but at the prices charged they shouldn't happen. Based on my previous experiences I will still recommend Hemenway's highly and hope that this meal was an exception (it was Labor Day). Both friends who were with me enjoyed their meals.
September 6, 2015|My new favorite|5|If I could eat here daily I would. High quality food, high quality service, and great ambiance. I especially enjoyed all of the locally sourced food.
September 5, 2015|Lovely evening|5|The hardest part of the evening was deciding what to order - the menu is varied and enticing, The oyster appetizer was amazing, the calamari would have benefitted from a sauce for dipping, but was tender and tasty. All four of us thoroughly enjoyed our entrees, all seafood, which was fresh and well-prepared. The waiter was excellent, friendly, efficient and attentive. Will go here again - soon, I hope!
September 5, 2015|An Off Day?|3|Holiday weekend so the restaurant was busy. We had reservations so we were seated right away. Food was generally good, but some what disappointing. Clams casino were bland and dry. My wife had Stuffed Lobster that was a lobster with cracker crumbs with scallops and shrimp in it. Like the clams casino, stuffing was bland and dry. I had the Alaskan King Crab Legs which were excellent. When our food was delivered, I asked for another beer. About 10 minutes later, I had to ask again. I finally received it right before we finished our meal. Perhaps it was an off day, so we may visit again
September 4, 2015|Wow!|5|We stopped in at Hemenways on our way to Martha's Vineyard for our anniversary weekend. We were absolutely impressed by every item we ordered. Super fresh king crab legs, crab and lobster cakes, the Lobster Mac and a seafood pasta. I expected good, I got exceptional. This one is a keeper! FYI: our server Bill was flawless, knowledgeable, and on point the entire time. Hugh thank you - what a great way to start a weekend.
September 4, 2015|Practically perfect seafood in Providence|5|Hemenway's is the top seafood restaurant in Providence, and possibly in all of Rhode Island. A creative menu, attractive surroundings, competent wait staff and really fresh fish make visiting it a must for visitors to Providence and anyone passing through.
September 4, 2015|Local find - Hemenway's|5|We chose this place due to close proximity to Hampton inn and suites where we stayed for a night. It is a very nice restaurant. Food is superb, service is very attentive and friendly. I'm sure we'll dine there again and again since our child is in the college in Providence. We will definitely recommend this place
September 4, 2015|Excellent|5|Each time I am in Providence RI I try to dine at Hemenway's. Food is always wonderful, service impeccable, luncheon specials are always a bargain.
August 29, 2015|Hemingway Restaurant|5|The restaurant's food was outstanding. Although it was expensive, it was worth it. Not everybody knows of this restaurant, but when they try their food, they will wish that they had known of this restaurant. If Warren Buffett is reading this review, I'm a huge fan and come here every day of the week. Even though it is fish themed, you need to try the lasagna. If you like snow crab, king crab has a different texture but the flavor is still great. The Filet Mignon is small at 8 ozs but at medium, the center is perfectly cooked and although Filet Mignon is not known for flavor, the flavor was phenomenal. The Lobster has a such great flavor. And it looks like a 500$ meal, but it's 48$. If you want crispy calamari, come here. If you want anything on the menu, come here.
August 29, 2015|Best meal in Providence|5|While visiting Providence, Unbeknownst to us we made a reservation at Hemenway's on a Saturday evening that was part of Providence's summer Waterfire celebration. Parking was crazy and we were unaware of the complimentary parking next door to the restaurant. 😔. After walking many blocks, we arrived to find our reserved table ready as promised! The restaurant and area were very busy, but our server, Lucas, and the restaurant were accommodating and seated us in a high booth to help my husband who has a hearing loss. We had appetizers (shrimp cocktail 👌, calamari 😒 [soggy]), clam chowder 👌, swordfish (excellent) and paella (spicy and loaded with seafood). We enjoyed wine with dinner but were too stuffed to attempt dessert. It was a lovely dinner and then fun to stroll through the adjacent park and see the Waterfire display on the river. All in all - a wonderful evening in Providence!
August 29, 2015|Special Ocassions!|4|We were having a send off dinner for our two college sophomores and our first waterfire. This is a great spot, so close to the river. Seafood was good, particularly the calamari, served on a bed of peppers. Make a reservation, got very crowded. Excellent service.
August 28, 2015|Great Food and service|5|This restaurant is great. We were looking for a good Seafood restaurant near our hotel on short notice. The Menu and the food were great, and they were really nice to the kids. I would definitely return if i am in the area again.
August 27, 2015|Great evening|5|Great night..met up with old friends. Food was very good. Our waitress was very attentive, informative, delightful with a great personality. We will return. We were there once before many years ago..and last night we asked ourselves why did we wait so long? It was a good night.

August 25, 2015|Loved this restaurant!|5|Great server, food was fantastic. Best clam chowda!!
August 23, 2015|Always impressive|5|Everyone is always very nice and accommodating here. I got to sit at a table with a view of the river this time and it was beautiful. I ordered some oysters, which are always excellent. I also had one of the specials of the day, which was scallops served over a bed of beet and goat cheese risotto. I love beets and goat cheese and this dish did not disappoint. For dessert, I had the new(er) added chocolate gateau, which is very rich and decadent. Not quite what I was expecting in a typical french gateau, but layers of chocolate and mousse with raspberry drizzle - can't go wrong there. I ended up taking most of it home with me for breakfast the next day. I love that they have french press coffee. I'm always looking for good coffee on my travel days! Service was excellent, even though I came for the final (only remaining) reservation of the evening. I didn't realize they closed early on Sunday until I left. But I never felt rushed by my server at all. I was only in town for one night this trip and made sure to visit Hemenway's. I'll be back.
August 23, 2015|Gift card|5|My husband and I had not been for a while and our daughters gave us a gift card. It was a fabulous way to end our summer. We will be back. Five stars across the board. I think our waiter for Lou. He was wonderful.

August 19, 2015|Just Spectacular|5|Hemenways is better than ever. Just absolutely superb in every way. The food is more than outstanding, and the service is impeccable. One of the finest restaurants in. New England. Totally professional in every way. Particular thanks to Allie, our server. She was just spectacular.
August 18, 2015|Superb food!|5|The New England style clam chowder was a poem in a bowl! Flavorful, thick, creamy, with delicious and tender clams that were painstakingly and properly cleaned- not a grain of sand. It was a lovely and memorable dinner.

Dined on August 15, 2015|Great dining experience!|5|Terrific view, scrumptious meals, handsome decor, fun vibe, and attentive wait staff and management. I'm a vegetarian, and Hemenways offered a beautifully prepared selection of fresh, locally grown vegetables and veggie-studded grains. We had a perfect view of the river as Water Fire preparations got underway.
August 14, 2015|We had the best 35th anniversary dinner....|5|We had the best 35th anniversary dinner. They treated us to some sparkling wine & rose petals on the table. The food was so good. Our server, Danny, was an excellent guide in helping us pick wine as well as assist us in choosing which main courses to select. I wish we lived closer so that we could come back!
August 13, 2015|Fabulous Lobster|5|We stopped here for lunch while visiting in Providence. Two of us had lobster rolls, and on our waiter's recommendation, one had the special lobster macaroni and cheese. Our waiter, Larry, was just right -- friendly and informative, but not intrusive. If you can, get a table by the river where there is a lovely view. The wine list, while not extensive, had some lovely options. If in town, we will definitely visit again.
August 12, 2015|25th Anniversary|5|I made a reservation based on friends' recommendations. I have known about Hemenway's for a long time but have never eaten there before for fear of it being too expensive. The prices were reasonable, not what I expected. The food and service was excellent. There were many food options available. My wife and I had a wonderful time on our 25th Anniversary thanks to the staff at Hemenway's. I would definitely recommend Hemenway's to everyone. I will most definitely be back.
August 12, 2015|Service at lunch time could be a little ...|4|Service at lunch time could be a little better paced... when luncheon patrons don't order a cocktail we seem to be waiting quite a bit longer than necessary in between water and order time. We have an hour for lunch, and four people ordering the same lunch salad should not be late back to their office! (happens just about every time we go, but it doesn't stop us from going and enjoying the food and outdoor atmosphere, that's for sure!)
August 7, 2015|Never Disappoints|5|While I know this is mainly a seafood restaurant, there is not one thing bad thing on the menu. The service is always exceptional and, given the quality of the food, the price is excellent.
August 6, 2015|Never Disappointed!|5|The wait staff at Hemenway's is one of the best I have experienced consistently at a restaurant. They are knowledgeable, extremely friendly, and courteous with just the right level of attentiveness. The food is always top notch, I have had a number of seafood dishes there and it was always fresh and cooked perfectly. The seasonings are just right and their dessert chef doesn't fail on any of their offerings. I am always comfortable bringing guests here for special occasions knowing full well the evening will be enjoyed. And while their prices are not cheap, they're not above their worth. You absolutely get what you pay for. And that to me means they're worth the value.
August 4, 2015|Great time had by all.|5|The fried clams are off the hizzy. I enjoyed both lunch and dinner. Check it out.
August 3, 2015|Great Birthday Dinner!|5|Birthday celebration at Hemenways. We had a variety of apps this time. The crab & lobster cakes were especially delicious and nicely presented. I requested a table overlooking the River for this special occasion, and not only did they accommodate my request, but they also surprised me with a birthday dessert. Great food, atmosphere, service.
August 2, 2015|Providence Staple|5|outstanding food and service We have been dining here for 10 years and its always consistent
August 1, 2015|One of Rhode Island's best|5|Chris, our server was excellent! The food was superb. If it hadn't been for the 30 min wait, even with reservations, in order to be seated, our experience would have been one of the best ever. The food was delicious, but the service delivered by Chris is one of the best we've ever had. Thank you, Chris.
August 1, 2015|Great Place|5|Wonderful food and atmosphere, service was excellent.
August 1, 2015|Great fun, knowledgeable server, friendly staff|5|Really enjoyed the evening. Loved the food. Did not feel rushed even thought we were there to enjoy dinner and than Waterford. Loved having parking available.Tupper
August 1, 2015|Lost in space|1|We came on a busy night, but reservations had been made more than three weeks in advance. Despite that, we did not get the table we requested. Our reservation was for 6:30. By 8:00, when our dinners still hadn't come and the server had told us repeatedly that they were on their way, we were told that the kitchen had lost our order. Although we were given free drinks and shrimp cocktail, this situation pretty much ruined the evening. This was very sad because we were entertaining guests from out of town.
August 1, 2015|Just okay.|2|"One diner said her salmon was a little overcooked. The margarita did not taste good. The drinks after the initial round took a long time to get to our table. One drink was ordered during the main course and did not arrive until we were eating dessert. The rest of the food was good, but not amazing. Also, a little on the salty side. For the prices, we were expecting better food. One of the staff asked us how the food was, and when we told him about the margarita, we got ""Well, we make our own sour mix,...etc."" We wondered if he was just expecting us to say everything was great and was a little off balance when he did not get that. I said to him, ""You asked for our feedback, so we're giving it."""

July 25, 2015|Wife's Birthday|5|I planned a quick trip for my wife's birthday to providence for a weekend. I had never been there myself. I was lucky to research Hemenways before hand and made reservations. They did not disappoint. The staff was very friendly and helpful offering suggestions. The food was great. Wide variety of Oysters and Lobster Mac N Cheese was wonderful. Served in the lobster itself. Top 5 dining experience I've ever had.
July 25, 2015|Delicious!|5|We feel confident that whatever we order will be delicious! We've had swordfish, steak, shrimp, paella, scallops, cheesecake all delicious. Of course you can't go to Hemenways without ordering the calamari. You won't be disappointed in the food. This time the service was slightly lacking, but we didn't know it was restaurant week, so I think they were exceptionally busy.
July 25, 2015|Great Time at Hemenway's|5|Took the train from Boston to take advantage of Provedence Restaurant Week. We could not have made a better choice than Hemenway's. Arrived a bit early and ordered a cocktail at the bar. I asked to taste the sour mix before ordering a scotch sour. I've had too many experiences where my drink was ruined because the bar uses that glow-in-the-dark premixed stuff in the bottle. The bartender knew exactly why I asked and told me that Hemenway's makes their own sour mix, using only fresh lemons, limes, and simple syrup. It was perfect. The three course meal (we all had salad, surf n turf: sirloin steak and grilled shrimp, and flourless chocolate cake for dessert) was delicious, and we had a great table overlooking the river. I will definitely return to Hemenways again, even if it's not Restaurant Week. The service ( from the hostess, to the bartenders, to our waiter, Danny) was impeccable. Combined with an excellent meal and lovely ambiance, it made for an awesome evening.
July 24, 2015|Class, quality, location|4|Hemenways is a higher end, elegant but busy restaurant on the waterway in Providence. The service is good, and the food is very good. I got surf and turf with a clam chowder appetizer. The clam chowder was straight ahead good old New England clam chowder. My wife said her gazpacho was quite good. My wife got a braised chicken dish that she said was very different, quite spicy and she enjoyed. She also said the oysters there were the best she has had in her 17 years in the United States. I'm not much of an oyster guy, but I would take her word for it - she loved them. There was outside seating, but we sat in the dining room looking out on the river. The only negative and this is slight, is that across the river where the occasional gondola would drift by, was a building with some boarded up windows.
July 24, 2015|Excellent Food Week Lunch|5|Took a Friday off and drove from Boston down to Providence and ate at Hemenway's for the Food Week Lunch. The restaurant is elegant but not overstated, the set lunch menu they offered for Food Week was very good but the service was absolutely outstanding. Some highly touted restaurants I've gone to during Food Weeks made me feel like we were hoi poloi, bargain hunters to be stuck near the kitchen door. But we we given a table with an excellent view of the river and every single service employee at Hemenway's was friendly, attentive and professional. That was refreshing. We enjoyed our lunch very much and will try to go down there again sometime for a special occasion dinner.
July 23, 2015|very nice evening !|4|everything about this restaurant was very solid from the welcoming hostess and prompt seating to the food. traditional decor, nice space--liked the New England feel. however, although this aesthetic and means nothing, I thought their use of neon signage was odd and took away from the cozy, rich atmosphere. the walk-up made me nervous because it looked like a cheesy ground floor restaurant in a moderate hotel. not so!
July 23, 2015|Dinner- Restaurant Week|5|Did not disappoint! Food was fabulous, and varied menu for Restaurant week. Quite happy with my surf & turf dish. Service was exceptional! Thank you Maura - for being efficient, personable, attentive, accurate and an all around fabulous server! We shall return! DB77- Newport
July 22, 2015|Excellent Food and Staff|5|The food was delicious as usual. Hemenway's has the best clam chowder I have ever had! Our server was very friendly and attentive.
July 22, 2015|Fish tacos were good, broiled seafood wa...|4|Fish tacos were good, broiled seafood was good like something from the early 90s though. The valet put a free valet sign out so we figured we would tip him instead of street parking only to be told at the end after tipping him it was another $6 and he put the wrong sign out. Called the manager and told him and heard nothing back. They usually are on top of something like this. Lunch ended up being more expensive than planned.
July 21, 2015|Great Food and Great Setting|5|Had a wonderful lunch during Providence Restaurant Week. The menu selections were very good. My wife had the broiled seafood platter and I had the salmon. Both were excellent. It was very busy while we were there but still our server was attentive and efficient.
July 20, 2015|Yum!|5|We went during restaurant week...had the best clam chowder ever. The fish tacos and seafood broil was excellent.. The ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. Only disappointment was the chocolate cookie for dessert...not enough chocolate chips and bland. Good thing the restaurant have a discounted validated parking at garage. Street parking is scarce.
July 19, 2015|Great dinner|5|Lobster bisque & stuffed lobster were delicious. Lobster ravioli was also a hit. Did not care for the clams casino. Mussels were tasty and large. Great dinner! Very attentive staff.
July 19, 2015|45 minutes before the bread basket came ...|3|45 minutes before the bread basket came after 2 requests. Service was slow the entire time. The food is fine. Great for someone that wants the standard preparation of seafood. The view outside is nice. The waiter did bring a free dessert to the table although he never asked us if we wanted dessert or gave us the dessert menu.
July 19, 2015|Good value for Restaurant Week|4|Food was very good. Server was friendly, but we waited a long time for coffee.
July 18, 2015|Happening place hansomly decorated in do...|4|Happening place hansomly decorated in downtown Providence Extremely efecient and pleasant staff Unbeknownst to us, picking someone up from the rail station, it was restaurant week and Fire on the River might. The place was packed and chaotic Service and food was still good enough that I would go back.
July 17, 2015|Restaurant week|4|Four of us got together for dinner on the first Friday of Providence Restaurant Week. The menu had a decent choice to please various palates. We chose the salmon and the surf and turf. Both were delicious and included generous portions. My only complaint was the noise level in the packed restaurant. It was hard to hear across the table. The service was professional. The nearby valet parking was extremely convenient. We will definitely return, but perhaps on a week night when it may be less noisy.
July 17, 2015|Good value for Restaurant Week|3|As always, the food was very good. perfect lunch sized portioins during Restaurant Week. However, two out of three of our group has to make another selection, as they were out of the salmon we ordered. I know these things happen, and the seafood is very fresh, but really - aren't they in the restaurant business?? How can you run out of a staple of your menu at lunch time? I would go back, of course, (it was my 2nd time there last week, but ended up getting the same thing both times due to the lack of salmon).
July 15, 2015|Date night score!|4|My boyfriend & I have been wanting to try this place & we were not disappointed. We had a booth by the window overlooking the river. The food was delicious. He got salmon & I got the skate. We also tried the clam chowder & gazpacho as appetizers since we went for restaurant weeks. For dessert, there was citrus cheesecake which melted in your mouth and flourless chocolate cake - a must for chocolate lovers. The atmosphere was eclectic but romantic. We want to go back for oysters & drinks.
July 15, 2015|Excellent food and exceptional service! ...|5|Excellent food and exceptional service! Beautiful property in the neighborhood. Staff is friendly and attentive to service and needs of their diners.!
July 15, 2015|Great meeting spot|4|"Easy destination for cousins traveling from Boston for annual get-together. Great waitress delivered yummy lunch. Soup super hot (just the way I like it). The only entree that was disappointing and messy was the fish tacos. Loved our front ""power"" table."
July 12, 2015|Hemenways gets 5 stars from me|5|Service was excellent, attentive but not hovering. Food came out in a timely fashion, giving time between courses. Everyone's plate looked delicious. I had Oysters Hemenway, which I felt came out too hot. I about burned my mouth with the first one I took. But after letting them sit a bit, the oysters were still raw with just the topping hot and crusty, as it should be. Main course was the Seafood Combo Salad. YUM. Perfect choice since I was going to have dinner in just 5 short hours! Seafood was enough, would have liked a few more oranges, citrus dressing was light and not overpowering. Perfect. Others at the table had the filet. I was able to sneak a taste. It was melt in your mouth perfection served on top of mashed potatoes (?) with au jus on the very bottom. Another had a lobster. He was satisfied, he has always wanted a Maine lobster!
July 11, 2015|excellent dinner|5|We had made reservations but ended up arriving a bit early. They were very kind and willing to seat us early in and even had a print out of our reservation with our special requests. All the staff members were polite and very helpful. The food was out of this world, the view one of the best, and we have already made plans to return again.
July 10, 2015|Service gaps|3|Not looking for perfection but want to note a few gaps that could easily improve dining experience: had to ask for bread 3 times/ingredient requested on the side ended up in salad/ tough lobster pieces in pasta dish could have been trimmed in kitchen/service started prompt and friendly but fell off badly as it got busy later. Still, would try it again.
July 10, 2015|Amazing meal & service!|5|We went for a birthday dinner & service was amazing. Red rose petals were sprinkled on our white table cloth to set the scene. Dinners were fresh & delicious! Apps were beautifully presented and wonderfully prepared! Wines were perfectly paired. Dessert of key lime cheesecake with a candle was delivered to our table at the end of dinner. YUM! Validated parking too! Can't wait to go back! 5 stars!
Dined on July 8, 2015|Serviceable but not great|3|The food was fine but not extraordinary. For the price and reputation I would have expected more. It felt more like a high-priced chain restaurant. It seemed rather industrial as if they were merely going through the motions, living on their reputation rather than on the quality. Too bad. It wouldn't have taken much to make it amazing.
July 4, 2015|Celebrating Independence Day|5|Over the July 4th weekend we had family in town from Atlanta. They had only visited us at Christmas time and we wanted to show them the best of RI, during the summer, without battling Newport and South County traffic. We had asked for a round table for our party of 6 and we were accomodated with a view overlooking the gondoliers on the River. Jayson was our waiter and he was SUPERB. Attentive, friendly, efficient and professional describe the caliber of service we received. The food was magnificent and we weren't shy about ordering drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert. Of course, the tab reflected our sophisticated palettes, but it was worth every penny. Our guests loved the experience, and as we left the restaurant, we watched the fireworks being launched from India Point Park! Very festive and beautiful!!
July 4, 2015|The Power Lunch is a Home Run!|5|"We stopped in for lunch on a lazy Saturday afternoon. The extensive lunch menu includes a wide selection of multi-course ""Power Lunches"" with awesome portions of the most delicious seafood. I had the best fish taco's, but there was something for everyone from salads to fish and chips. Also, I cannot say enough about the wonderful service....responsive, professional and genuinely thoughtful. The package is topped off with fresh, hand pressed coffee and tasty chocolate chip cookies. I will find an excuse to return soon ."
July 3, 2015|Lunch|4|Our server Danny was attentive, great and funny..Kuddos to him. Definitely a great employee. Lobster ravioli was nice

June 28, 2015|Always Great|5|One of the best restaurants in Providence and it never disappoints. Highly recommend the Sea Food Pasta dish.
June 28, 2015|Great seafood restaurant|4|We loved our Tuna Nicoise salad and the Seafood pasta. Both were done very well. The seafood tasted fresh.

June 27, 2015|Our new favorite!|5|We had not been to Hemingway's in several year's. WOW.....We were pleasantly surprised! Chris was our waiter and was exceptional. He was very attentive and our food and service was exceptional. The parking was so convienent and the parking attendant's were terrific. We cannot wait to go back!
June 27, 2015|The food was delicious!  Loved the view....|4|The food was delicious! Loved the view. Service was excellent. Noise level was higher than expected, though. I would definitely go back.
June 27, 2015|Hemenway's was fun and enjoyable|5|My son and I were in town to kick off his summer at Brown. A local friend here in Cincinnati Ohio recommended Hemenway's and it was fantastic. We really enjoyed the ambiance inside the restaurant. All of the wait staff was friendly and accommodating. Our server, Sheila, was especially friendly and provided us with helpful hints about other restaurants and places to visit while we were in Providence. My son had the lobster mac n cheese and was very pleased with the presentation and quality of food. And he knows his mac n cheese. The arcadian redfish was especially tender and well presented. We would recommend to our friends!
June 26, 2015|Dinner with friends|5|I had dinner at Hemenway's Friday night with a group of friends and we had a great dinner. The food was excellent, especially the oysters!! The service was great. The whole experience was very enjoyable. I definitely recommend the restaurant to friends!!
June 26, 2015|Excellent!|5|My husband and I were celebrating our 22nd wedding anniversary and came to your restaurant for the first time. Our experience was outstanding. Nancy was our server and she went above and beyond to make this evening even more memorable. Can't wait to go back!!!!!

June 23, 2015|Disappointed|4|"2 in our party of 6 ordered lobster dinners. Sadly, the lobster for each was tough and ""rubbery"". Neither of us complained as it was a special occasion. Each of us took the leftover lobster home and disposed of it. Usually love the food. Hemenways is our favorite restaurant. However, on any subsequent visit, we will avoid the lobster. The service was excellent. The other diners seemed pleased with their meals. The ambience is wonderful."
June 19, 2015|Favorite tourist restaurant for seafood|4|My wife and I spent the weekend in providence. Read reviews at different websites and settled on this restaurant. We were told by locals there were cheaper seafood restaurants that were good but we were committed. We both has the crab legs and were not disappointed. They were sweet and we were full when finished. Free parking was a plus. I would recommend this restaurant and would return.
June 18, 2015|A wonderful experience here.  Our server...|5|A wonderful experience here. Our server Zlava (spelling) was fantastic, extremely attentive. The outdoor entertainment was superb. My only recommendation is for the establishment to update its dress code policy. My guest and I wore business casual as suggested but were frustrated when we noticed other patrons wearing the complete opposite. Despite the wardrobe mix up, a great dining experience
June 13, 2015|Outstanding Food!|5|We have been to Hemenways many times and it's one of our favorite restaurants! The food and service is outstanding!
June 13, 2015|Nothing bad to say.|5|My fiancé and I went to Hemenways before checking out the Waterfire festival. They were offering a Waterfire special that included a starter, entree, and dessert. I chose a garden salad, grilled salmon, and a flourless chocolate cake. All amazing. My fiancé had clam chowder, surf & turf, and the chocolate cake as well. He loved it all. We also had espresso martinis with our chocolate cake, which were PERFECT. The food, service, and experience is worth every penny spent.
June 13, 2015|JenD|5|This restaurant is a favorite of mine for lunch since it's close to my office. The food is consistently good, and the service is generally quick and attentive. I highly recommend it.
June 12, 2015|Fantastic dinner!|5|We received a gift certificate for hemenways a while back. We decided to use it for our anniversary date. We were so happy to. Our server, Jamie, was so personable and helpful without being intrusive. The food was outstanding and plentiful The clam chowder was creamy but not heavy. Just the way we like it the lobster bisque did not disappoint at all. Our paella and skate were the prize of the night. Perfectly cooked and savory. The wine Jamie recommended was just perfect for the meal. We are looking forward to coming back.
June 12, 2015|We've been thinking about going to Hemen...|3|"We've been thinking about going to Hemenway's for quite some time. We were very disappointed. While the earliest we could book thru Open Table was 9:15, when we arrived it wasn't very busy. The waiter was flip, too casual and unprofessional. The food, a Grilled Shrimp Salad, was average. The shrimp seemed warmed in a microwave. My ""whole fish"" special was tasteless and complete with bones without an offer to de-bone. The sides and rolls were prepared hours ago. **If you come to Providence (which is a GREAT foodie town) go to one of the independent restraints like Nick's on Broadway, or Garde de La Mare, or Gracie's. Stay away from anything 'corporate-owned!**"

June 11, 2015|Great food, slow service|3|The food here was great, very well repaired, tasty, but the service was a little slow. I know that they don't want people to feel rushed, but it took almost 20 mins to get our drinks. Then we waited almost an hour to get our food. Be prepared to take some time of you're going to eat here.
June 11, 2015|Great as always|5|Had another good meal here. The waitress was sensitive to our time issue (we had theater tickets) and was very attentive and kept things moving smoothly. We had a variety of fish and we enjoyed it all. Fresh veggies and fresh fish - a great combo. With free valet parking to boot.
June 8, 2015|What can I say to truly complement this place?|5|"I will keep this short and sweet because I don't know if there is much to say other than, ""this place is amazing!"" We went to celebrate a new job, and the food was nothing short of a delight. We did not feel rushed through any of our courses, and everything was cooked perfectly. This kind of experience for such low price is very hard to find these days. !00% recommend!"

June 7, 2015|A Family Favorite Again|5|Hemenway's had long been a family favorite, but the last few years it seemed to go down hill. I am happy to report that it is back, although I still preferred their heavily seafood focus, there is enough seafood on the menu to satisfy those looking for good fish. My only complaint and it is common to most higher end restaurants - STOP piling food on top of each other. if I want to combine things I can do it my self, but hate getting purees on the bottom of my nice fresh fish (or meat)!

May 30, 2015|flexible|4|They let us change our reservation last minute to accommodate a specific table request. Patio is first come first serve. Windows and location right on the river are great. Service was wonderful.
May 30, 2015|great Providence spot|5|"Outstanding food and service! It had been years but we hope to make it a ""regular"" dining spot."
May 30, 2015|Special Occastion|5|After living in RI and MA all our lives we finally decided to try Hemenways. We're not sure why we never tried it before and were perhaps intimidated by how upscale it is. However, for our 23rd wedding anniversary we decided to venture out. The service was excellent. Our waitress (I wish I could remember her exotic name) was very attentive and courteous. The complimentary proseco was a nice touch. The food was absolutely perfect and the wait time in between courses wasn't bad at all. We definitely will be hitting this spot again and not wait for a special occasion. We already know what our next meal selection will be. Thank you for making our day extra special!!!
May 29, 2015|Fine Dining Standard|5|We were seated as per my request upon placing the reservations. The staff were excellent in accommodating us. We were only there for appetizers dessert and drinks, this did not deter the wait staff for delivering some of the best dining experience I had enjoyed in a very long time. Hemenways definitely sets the standard high and it was a fantastic overall experience. Some of the patrons next to us were a bit boisterous which impacted our experience, we were hoping they would be spoken to about keeping it down to a dull roar, but this can not always be helped.
May 28, 2015|Made a detour from Logan to Worcester for this.|5|Last year my wife and a co-worker were in town and they ate lunch here. The two loved it so much that they came back the very next day and ordered the exact same dish - the baked stuffed shrimp. I am originally from New England and live in SC and my wife told me I had to eat there. We just got back from my 40th reunion In Worcester and went from Logan to Providence just to dine here before going on to Worcester. The inside and outside were very attractive, the view was terrific, I liked the option of outside dining in the shades of the trees and beautiful surrounding buildings of Brown University. Service and food was exceptional!
May 27, 2015|Excellent|5|For all three of us, ordering very different items from the menu: each was excellent! I hadn't been here in quite awhile and feel that they have upgraded even more in their food quality.
May 27, 2015|Fabulous food; great service.|5|I have been coming to Hemenway's for almost 25 years and I have never had a bad meal here. The lobster bisque is amazing, as is the clam chowder. The seafood is always cooked just the way you like it, and everything else that you order will be wonderful too. The seafood is fresh and mostly local. The service is always impeccable. Don't miss out.
May 21, 2015|Always consistent. Nice atmosphere.|5|Staff are exceptional. Atmosphere is great, free valet. Great location.
May 20, 2015|Incomparable!|5|The evening started with a quiet booth with a view. The waiter was friendly and helped with our decisions. The food was FANTASTIC! We had the famous calamari appetizer, - it was the best we'd ever eaten, both the caesar and house salads were good, the chowder very good. The swordfish was fabulous (the best I've ever eaten!) the skate was delicious, the scallops fantastic, and the seafood casserole absolutely scrumptious! We were too full for dessert, but did get coffees and cappuccinos which were also the best we've had. Overall, this was one of the finest restaurants I've eaten in.

May 17, 2015|Enjoyment|5|I have eaten here many times with Family and Business Clients alike. Never had I had a bad experience in food and or in service. We always highly recommend the place for what ever nice occasion you would like to celebrate.
May 16, 2015|Hemenways|5|My favorite restaurant in Providence. Right on the river..great service and delicious fresh seafood. Always enjoy coming here.
May 15, 2015|Graduation celebration|4|Had out son's pre-graduation dinner here. Excellent wine list, and an extensive seafood menu. Our table has the Lobster mac-and-cheese, served in the lobster shell, lazy man style. I had the 2 lb baked stuffed lobster, stuffed with crab meat, whole scallops and whole shrimp. Unbelievable. On of our party had the lobster ravioli, the other have the shrimp manecso. desserts were outstanding too
May 15, 2015|Beetle|5|Excellent food and service! I would highly recommend this restaurant. The fried clams were the best I have ever eaten!
May 14, 2015|Always a Good Choice|4|We went to Hemenways for our 26th Anniversary dinner and just like multiple times prior, they never disappoint. The food is always fresh and once again my wife requested something that was not on the menu to which the kitchen accomodated without issue. There was a large party nearby so that increased the noise level. Our waitress was great and knowledgable, and very attentive. Always a good choice
May 14, 2015|Two halls don't make a whole|5|"Hemenways is always a treat. The food and service are always top notch, and for a seafood restaurant, they also happen to serve a mean filet (for you non-seafoodies). My only complaint on this visit is what is almost false advertising. I ordered the lobster mac 'n cheese ""with a whole lobster."" I specifically ordered this dish as lobster mac n cheese is a personal favorite, but I have never had a ""whole lobster"" as part of that experience. Well, I still never have. My dish had four claws, but no lobster tail. Trust me, I know the difference between claw, knuckle and tail meat when it comes to lobster. So why no tail if it's a whole lobster? Four claws are obviously two ""half"" lobsters, but two halfs don't make a whole, especially in this instance. And Hemenways offered larger lobster for additional money. But would I get a tail if I paid for a two pound lobster? I would hope so, but based on my experience, you can't count on it. Misleading and false advertising for this dish. But I'll go back! I just probably won't pay for this dish again."
May 14, 2015|Great!|4|Met friends here the other day for lunch. Great selection of seafood, lovely ambiance. Delicious food, and great service! Hard to beat!
May 12, 2015|Excellent meal at Hemenways!|5|We went to Hemenways to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a nice, quiet table near the window with a view of the river. The food was delicious, and our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. We had a wonderful time, and I would definitely go back again! It's a great place to go for special occasions!
May 10, 2015|you can never go wrong!|5|Excellent food and service every time we go here. I love that the staff regardless of level if emoloyment all pitches in to ensure your visit and meal is quality. They make each patron feel special and ensure all your needs are met. The complimentary valet is nice as well on Morher's Day.

May 2, 2015|Excellent waiter|5|We had a wonderful table for 8 and a great waiter Chris. He took such good care of 8 senior women and made your restaurant very special. So I thank you very much for a delightful dinner on May 2.
April 25, 2015|First time -|4|My son who is a PC sophomore was receptive to going out to dinner and suggested this spot. It's a little pricey, but it was excellent. Calamari were good except I was surprised with tentacles. We ate around those. I only like the rings. My scrod was excellent and the salad was good too. We all had fish and were not disappointed.
April 25, 2015|Delicious food and exceptional service from all|5|From beginning to end the service was 5 star . The valet parking was great.. The staff is very friendly and accommodating . The food was sent out timely and tasted delicious. And key lime pie was amazing !

April 20, 2015|excellent food, service|4|Everything was delicious - from the warm rolls on the table to the calamari to the entrees. The paella was really outstanding. The lobster with mac n cheese was not really worth the hype. Desserts also good. Of course, all was pricey so this is not your middle-of-the-week dinner place!
April 20, 2015|Usually better|4|Hemenways has always been consistant. The food is always good; the setting is lovely and service is excellent!! The only issue that I had was with the lunch special. The fries were cold and undercooked and the broiled & breadcrumb topped fish was pretty dissappointing. The salads were terrific as usual. Overall I still love this restaurant!!
April 19, 2015|Moving An Option|5|"Hemenways continues to deliver on an excellent dining experience. My wife and I have been faithfully going for special occasions for 15 years and have never been disappointed with the service or meals. It is our ""special spot"" that would be our "" regular spot"" if we did not have to drive an hour to get there. I guess moving to Rhode Island from Connecticut would be worth it though!"
April 19, 2015|nice!|4|Really a treat from start to finish. Great food, service...view. Giant lobsters in the tank, 1/2 price wine bottles on Sunday... What's not to like?
April 18, 2015|Perfect Dining Experience!|5|We were seated promptly upon arrival, the staff was attentive but not over bearing. The food was fantastic and was large portions. A fantastic evening!
April 16, 2015|casual spot|3|good seafood, busy bar scene convenient location to the hotels and convention center.
April 14, 2015|Fantastic!|5|Waitress was great! I wish I could remember her name...she even surprised us with a dessert complimentary for a special occasion! It made our night and the food was equal to the service!
April 11, 2015|Reliably good!|4|Always reliably good food/wait staff. Sat for first time is back room, which is much quieter.
April 10, 2015|Must See|4|One of the best sea food restaurant in Providence. Lobster is the food to be tried here. Very busy, well served, and expensive restaurant, but worth it.
April 5, 2015|"Hemeway's is always a ""go to"" place to b..."|5|"Hemeway's is always a ""go to"" place to bring guests. Service is wonderful, as is food and everyone we've ever brought there has thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Our Easter meal was a little delayed (we hadn't even noticed and actually enjoyed the pace of the meal) and were given free deserts. What could be better?"
April 3, 2015|Our favorite seafood restaurant in Provi...|4|Our favorite seafood restaurant in Providence! Even on a busy Friday night, we were not rushed at all so we could celebrate 2 birthdays. Nice touch that the birthday girls' desserts arrived with a candle in each, and even nicer, were comped off our bill! Calamari appetizer enough to feed 3 of us. Shrimp cocktail nicely presented. Seafood pasta full of seafood - yummy! Ellie's stuffed shrimp ample portion with some leftover to take home. Sea scallops were excellent. Seafood casserole very rich but yummy. Thanks to our waiter, Chris, for making our night so special.
April 2, 2015|The lobster Mac and cheese presentation ...|5|The lobster Mac and cheese presentation was very unique. And the food was equally good.
April 2, 2015|Memorable from start to end|5|We were graciously seated at lunch by Debra to a lovely booth with a view. Then Chris took over and provided good suggestions and excellent service. Try the cheesy onion soup and power lunch. The broiled seafood grill was composed of shrimp, scallops and scrod. Delicious! We loved the accompanying brussel sprouts and zucchini. Memorable visit. Thanks Chris! We'll be back!
March 29, 2015|Excellent Lobster|5|The lobster was excellent and what you expect when dining in New England. If you get the lobster, make sure you get it fisherman style, which was recommended by my waiter Bruno, it stuffs the lobster with shrimp, scallops, and oysters in a bread crumb mix. I got to pick the lobster I wanted. The experience was excellent
March 28, 2015|Birthday Celebration|5|We took our daughter to Hemingway's for her Birthday. It was our first time dining at this establishment. The food and service was excellent. We will visit again and recommend to friends.
March 27, 2015|A top 10 meal|5|The food was amazing. All fresh and locally sourced. It now ranks as a top 10 lifetime meal. Superb.
March 27, 2015|great dinner again|5|Another great dinner, my wife always gets the lobstah and I usually get the steak (only because I don't like seafood) The service was great as always as well as the food.
March 21, 2015|Great dinner at Hemenway's|5|The four of us were all very pleased with our appetizer, salads, entrees, and desserts. It was a great dinner overlooking the river.
March 20, 2015|Our party of 4 loved the place.|5|The service was excellent. Although the restaurant was quite busy on the Friday nite, we never felt rushed. The waiter was extremely attentive, and his wine recommendation was perfect. The tuna was well prepared and tasy (we all had tuna!!). The Creme Bruele (three flavors) was yummy. You have us hooked, we will be back.
March 19, 2015|One of my favs in Providence. Raw shellf...|4|One of my favs in Providence. Raw shellfish was excellent. Brie seafood cassarole was a treat. Service was good. But they killed the keylime pie. They had a genuine pie and it was one of the best anywhere in the world. House made. Heavy rich filling almost custard like with a great crust b Now it's a fluffy instant pie filling creamy tart. Not worth the money or calories.
March 18, 2015|The seafood casserole was excellent.  Th...|4|The seafood casserole was excellent. The service was good two nights in a row. As mentioned in another review for a different trip, they killed the key lime pie. They made it into some kind of creamy gooey tartlet. What a shame since the pie was the best keylime in the country.
March 17, 2015|Clean, Bright, Delicious|5|"With sweeping windows filled with gorgeous views of the city, Hemenway's Restaurant is airy and bright - a perfect setting in which to enjoy delicious seafood. Words are difficult to find to describe the extraordinary ""Seafood Caesar Salad."" Piled high with an entire lobster tail, shrimp and crab meat, this main dish salad was beautiful to see and scrumptious to eat. The lovely setting, well spaced tables, efficient and unassuming staff made this a restaurant we will return to whenever possible."
March 15, 2015|Okay, but...|3|Food was generally pretty good, but prices MUCH too high. The scene is VERY loud - I could barely hear what my companion's were talking about. Claim chowder was good, but filled with potatoes, served in a HUGH bowl to justify the high price (yes, for a measured cups worth). The quality of the food was just fine, but if you want to leave your check book at home, go find a place that is more down to earth. This is a type of resturant for someone in their 20s who wants to impress their date. Overall - save your money and go somewhere else.
March 9, 2015|food|5|I enjoyed my meal but my date was not to impressed with his. Waitress very helpful and knowledgeable .
Dined on March 9, 2015|Consistently one of the best in Providence!|5|Great service and great food all the time. Highly recommended.
March 7, 2015|Excellent food and service.|5|Excellent food and amazing service. Food is fresh and taste is unique.
March 6, 2015|Excellent Choice|5|"I was visiting Providence, RI and wanted to taste the local fare. After reviewing online reviews, I decided to have dinner at Hemenway's. I love seafood and had high hopes. I was not disappointed. From the wait staff, the ambience and throughout the meal, everything was done to perfection. The oysters, salad and lobster entree' were the best I have ever had. As soon as I arrived, I was warmly greeted and seated -- actually given a preference for my table. I had made reservations. The staff were gracious, kind and the waiter provided sound and good input on what to order. I arrived after a long day at a conference and was not exactly dressed ""upscale,"" but was still treated like a treasured guest. This was good service and good food. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Providence and will recommend this restaurant to friends and colleagues who travel to Providence."
March 4, 2015|Enjoyed our dining experience!|4|"We arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation and were greeted and seated without a blink. Very pleasant view at dusk over the neighboring park. Our server was very polite, courteous and attentive. Food arrived in a pleasant time frame, and was delicious, very nice portions. It was a touch loud that evening but I believe they had a large ""business party"" going on. When we asked for a quick bill as our time frame to reach the theater on time got close, we were immediately taken care of. They offered to call us a cab, validate our parking quickly, etc. It was an overall very pleasant experience and one I will repeat."
March 3, 2015|Amazing as always|5|Great food staff and experience. Never disappointed when I eat here

February 28, 2015|Can't go wrong!|5|Sea food caesar salad and casserole were both perfect! Great Chowder and great place to enjoy New England seafood at its best!
February 28, 2015|Nice place, excellent staff, food meh|3|Everyone, from the welcoming staff, coat check person, bartenders and waitstaff were awesome. They were friendly and efficient. The food however, we not too good. I got the scrod. It was bland and arrived at the table cold. The mashed potatoes and sweet potato and turnip hash were pretty good. And the Caesar salad was ok. But the entre was a disappointment.
February 28, 2015|Incomparable fresh fish and perfect service!|5|You really can't beat the fish and the preparation was great. Two diners had the sole, which you don't often see on a menu. It was delicious and the tuna was the same. The Matunuck oysters that our server recommended were wonderful - cocktail sauce was just the right hot. The salads were okay. But drinks were perfect - good wine, nice dessert. Wonderful evening out. We'll be back!

February 21, 2015|Great Dinner|5|We were seated right away. Service was amazing. Everyone was freindly and attentive. Filet Mignon was the best I have ever had.

February 19, 2015|Lunch at Hemenway's for the first time!|5|I had a business lunch meeting at Hemenway's and it couldn't have gone any better. The service was terrific and the food was outstanding. I will definitely be treating more clients to lunch at Hemenway's!
February 15, 2015|Great Service|4|Great service. Seated immediately even though we were 15 minutes early. The Calamari is to die for. Fantastic! My wife had King Crab legs which she loved. I had a steak, perfectly done. Did not care for the grilled spinach which was fairly bland and tasteless. Overall we had a wonderful evening and meal. The one disappointment was the Key Lime pie with Mango topping and coconut whipped cream. It was too sweet for me and the key lime was overwhelmed by the mangos.
February 15, 2015|Great food and dining|5|This place was great! Fresh food, excellent service, and a variety of choices. Definitely will be going to eat here again when I visit Providence again.
February 15, 2015|fair food and good service|4|Food was fair, service was good, exellent klime pie. Please fix the portions ($27 for 5oz of salmon?) And fix the bread (not that good ) Overall very good experience. We'll be back.
February 14, 2015|Old favorite!|5|Hemenway's is consistently good. The ambiance terrific, and food top notch and the service at the high end. We've been coming here for years and the place continues to maintain its quality.
February 14, 2015|Fabulous Experience|5|From the moment we arrived throughout the entire evening, the service was outstanding! The food was absolutely incredible and completely worth the trip in the blizzard! Top Notch all the way!
February 14, 2015|Valentines 2015|4|Delicious fish dishes...worth going out in the blizzard for dinner
February 14, 2015|A favorite Providence restaurant|5|Hemenways never disappoints! The food is fantastic, the service is friendly and attentive and the ambience is perfect for a dinner with a small group of friends, or a romantic outing.
February 14, 2015|New England Valentine|5|Our server was very pleasant and attentive. They were accommodating, and food was excellent. Look forward to returning.
February 13, 2015|Excellent evening|4|Went there on Friday before Valentine's day, needless to say that the restaurant was full. This did not impaired the service which was still efficient. However the noise level was sometime uncomfortable. The food selection is directed mainly towards seafood. I had a good time trying different Lobster variations. Cooking was alway perfect and sides original, tasteful, and balanced. So was also the presentation of the dishes. The general sensation that stays is a refined meal with great view on the downtown of Providence. I would encourage anybody to try this excellent table, keeping in mind that prices come accordingly.
February 13, 2015|Right from the beginning everything was ...|5|Right from the beginning everything was delicious. The bread was served warm and crispy, our salad and clam chowder were one of the best we have ever had. The server was kind and discussed the specials with us. He always came over to see how things were and offered drinks and more bread!!My fiancé had the filet mignon which was delicious and cooked well. I had the lobster out of shell which was nice that the cooks went out of their way to do that for me. After a little while though my lobster did get cold so I wish I would have had it cleaned and just broken up into pieces. My own fault though. We will definitely be back for the great food! I have already recommended the restaurant to others! Open table was also very easy and stress free in getting reservations!
February 13, 2015|Great service|4|Or server for the night was Bill. He was pleasant, patient and helpful with suggesting a great plate. My wife just loved him. Complementary valet from inside the building was perfect on a balmy valentines eve.

February 13, 2015|BEST BLOODY MARY EVER!|5|Raw bar was awesome and the shrimp on top of the secret-recipe Bloody Mary was unreal!
February 12, 2015|Just alright|3|The food was fine. As an out of town, but regular, visitor I'm on a tour of Providence restaurants. This is middle of the road. Given all of the interesting, delicious and inventive fare in town, I think they really need to step it up if they want to be as better than average.
February 6, 2015|Long time winner|3|Hosted a business lunch and as someone who has dined here periodically over many years knew what to expect...predictable quality. FYI though despite premium pricing, lunch portions were modest to say the least. A mid-afternoon snack is required!
January 29, 2015|Birthday celebration|1|Couldn't have worked out better. I was planning my wife's birthday dinner with our boys and their girlfriends and was considering someplace we've never been before. My wife got wind of the plan and suggested one of our stand bys, Hemmenways. We've enjoyed other family celebrations there and this may have been the best. I reserved on OT then called to request that the kids be seated early for a surprise. No problem! The cocktail selection was fun and inventive. Oysters and calamari added to the festive atmosphere. Both were outstanding. Dinner selections included paella, tuna, sole, pot roast (land lubber) and all were great. Only disappointment: I ordered the crab/lobster cake app as an entree. Had these before and they were outstanding but this time they were starchy and bland. Admittedly, I wasn't feeling well so not sure any meal would have pleased me. Everyone else raved about their meals. Service was attentive but not intrusive. A great birthday dinner celebration site.

January 25, 2015|Always a winner at Hemenway's|5|Hemenway's is the perfect spot for brunch, lunch or dinner. A gorgeous view, superb service and beautifully prepared dishes. Sundays are great for half price bottles of wine!
January 23, 2015|We had Larry as our server, he was funny...|5|We had Larry as our server, he was funny and let us stay as late as we wanted. The food was amazing, there was one couple left in the restaurant and when we asked for a dessert menu he made a joke about not wanting to Go home and brought us exactly what we wanted. The food was great!
January 22, 2015|All of the above|5|Had a great time here! Hospitality: excellent. Seating: Booth, roomy and excellent. Waitstaff: Very friendly and excellent. Food: presentation, excellent. tasty and excellent., Service: excellent.. We would visit again.
January 21, 2015|Best fish tacos|5|Some of the best fish tacos we have ever had. For lunch they were quick and offered us a cookie and coffee to go after lunch.
January 19, 2015|Great choice for Seafood|4|We went in for restaurant week during the lunchtime rush. They were definitely busy, and the server let it show, but he was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. We had cocktails, and a four course meal, we went off book for the calamari which was fresh and tender. Then I had the lobster bisque with huge pieces of lobster, followed by fish tacos, they were served with salt and vinegar chips but I think I would have liked something a bit more delicate. Then we were served coffee in a to go cup along with a packaged cookie. It was a nice restaurant to go to for lunch, good food, but make sure you dress up!
January 18, 2015|Great dinner|5|Had a great dinner with my friends! The service is excellent and the food is delicious!
January 18, 2015|Hollie Charmed Us|4|I had a friend visiting from out of town, Oakland CA, and he's loves seafood so Hemingway's was the stop. Hollie was an absolute delight and even indulged in a debate we wete having regarding how to cook/eat steak even though we were there for seafood. She was awesome and the menu for restaurant week was great.
Dined on January 17, 2015|Date Night|5|Great restaurant for date night. Great food, and wonderful service.
January 17, 2015|Great as always|5|Took my mother and sister out for dinner. Everything was great. We are usually here to eat about 3 to 4 times a year.
January 17, 2015|Newport Restaurant Group Doesn't Disappoint|5|We dine at all of the NRG locations and Hemenway's is excellent. Every seat in the house is a good one. The service is very attentive but not pushy. The food is excellent, I suggest the raw bar. Drinks are always well made, my wife has a tricky one to make and they always get it right. Hemenway's is more expensive than most but worth the trip, it's a very nice experience. Highly recommended!
January 17, 2015|We enjoyed a lovely Saturday brunch at Hemenway's|4|Along with our beverages, three of us had the delicious lobster and crab cakes while my husband had a half dozen local oysters, which were firm and rather large, much to his delight. Our luncheon continued with lobster bisque and Caesar salad, followed by the delightful seafood broil which was more than a generous sized portion of each. Our waiter was very attentive, yet not overly hovering table side. We finished our meal with a well brewed cup of coffee and a cookie to go. It was a delightful way to spend a Saturday afternoon in the city.
January 16, 2015|Fantastic food and location|5|I have been commng here since the 1990's. The service and food are still excellent. Free valvet parking too. We came here because of resurant week. Fantastic dinner
January 13, 2015|Order oysters you can go wrong. I am her...|5|Order oysters you can go wrong. I am here in business once a year and we always diner at Hemenway's.
January 13, 2015|Service and quality|5|Our hostess was most helpful w/ getting parking space, our waitress was efficient and attentive and the chef's lunch specials were delicious. it was nice to go to a fine dining establishment and not be out of budget. Restaurant week is a great way to show off your special hospitality
January 11, 2015|I had one of the best seafood meals ever!!!|5|The localtion viewing the river was excellent. The turned a simple Cod dish into one of the best meals I ever had. The spices and cream sause were out of this world. My wife had chicken and it was turned into a outstanding meal with spices and preperation. Portins was hugh with a doggies bag taken home also. Serves was outstanding and the best experiences ever!!!
January 10, 2015|Great Lunch|5|We have eaten here many many times and it never disappoints. Terrific service and food.
January 4, 2015|Sunday dinner|5|I enjoyed a very nice dinner with 2 family members and a friend. We all enjoyed the food. Our waiter was excellent, personable and attentive. He let us know that on Sunday evenings bottles of wine were 1/2 price, which was a nice bonus. He also overheard us toasting our friend happy birthday and made sure the birthday boy's desert was complimentary.
January 2, 2015|Wonderful Anniversary Dinner|5|My boyfriend and I had a lovely anniversary dinner at Hemenway's this past weekend. We arrived early for our reservation and had a drink at the bar beforehand, followed by an absolutely fabulous dinner. The oysters were fresh (some had been in the water that very morning), the lobster bisque was delicious, and the entrees (lobster mac and cheese and seafood casserole) were top notch, with portions large enough for leftovers. We will definitely be returning if we go back to Providence in the future.
January 2, 2015|Fantastic Accomodating|5|We are a family of accommodations with dairy allergies and vegetarian constraints. Each need was met or exceeded with a smile. Lobster special was devine. Bread crumbs were made special to omit butter and collard greens were cooked up special to make without beef broth. My husband's filet was perfection. Every bite was delish! Can't wait to return.
January 2, 2015|Disappointed|2|I have dined here before and took a friend for the first time and they will not be returning. Our waitress was terrible and we ended up getting our entees to go because we just couldn't take it anymore and we had already been at there for an hour and a half because she initially entered our order incorrectly. She was not knowledgable of the menu and made things up, she couldn't explain the special and told us she didn't think we would want to hear about it when we asked if there were any. Was looking forward to a good night and nice meal and ended up very disappointed.
December 31, 2014|Fantastic|5|We went to Hemingway for New Years eve last minute we had an addition to our party and this was no problem we took our table within 5 minutes and began our night. The food was plenty full and amazing. We were given the champagne toast to ring in the New Year. We all had a great time with a fantastic meal.
December 31, 2014|New Year's Eve|4|I gave and overall rating of good only because the table we were seated in way in an aisle way. We frequent this restaurant twice a year for our anniversary and New Years eve. The table was set where the waiters and bus people move in a quick and frequent manner. We dressed appropriately and were disappointed when people dressed inappropriately were seated in comfortable booths and tables by the window. Next time we will reject this seating arrangement
December 31, 2014|NYE|4|Very crowded but it was NYE. No room at bar at all. Dinner reservations were a good idea and we still enjoyed our meal.

December 24, 2014|Christmas Eve Delight|4|Our favorite place to dine on Christmas Eve for the past 15 years. We were seated in the noisy bar area but after a party of 16 was seated it quieted down considerably. We know it is going to be noisy a but it is the food and service that draws us back. Scallops baked, pan seared salmon and seafood casserole were all tasty and well portioned. Alissa was the best service provider we have had. Martinis were mixed to perfection. See you Christmas Eve 2015!!!! probably sooner!!!
December 24, 2014|Wonderful view.|5|Food was great and the recommendations from the waiter were perfect. They don't rush you, which was important to us.
December 22, 2014|Ice in a martini?|3|I had it in mine. It was a specialty cocktail. Especially bad.
December 22, 2014|Business Luncheon|5|Hemenway's serves to impress out-of-town visitors for business luncheons, as the food, decor, and urban vistas all serve to energize the business discussions at hand.
December 21, 2014|Fabulous food, fabulous service, great w...|5|Fabulous food, fabulous service, great wine value, great time! Would come here again in a minute.
December 20, 2014|Fantastic|5|We had received a gift certificate last Christmas and decided to try Hemingway for an anniversary celebration. The reservation was easy to complete on line the parking garage was easy in and out. The service was fantastic. The meal was exceptional, we're going back for sure.
December 20, 2014|awesome seafood|5|we had a very good time at Hemenway's. The seafood was delicious, from the clam chowder to stuffed lobster. Bill, our servant, was fantastic and took very good care of us.
December 20, 2014|Nice time|4|Always good, consistent. Great oysters and drinks.
December 13, 2014|Excellent food. Service by Diane was fantastic.|5|Diane was our server and was fantastic. Will definitely ask for her again
December 9, 2014|A great dinner!|5|First time here...really enjoyed it and would like to go back at some point.
December 7, 2014|Our first dining experience here was won...|5|Our first dining experience here was wonderful. Shrimp scampi nicely presented and not overly garlic - just right! Ellie's stuffed shrimp also equally delicious. Our favorite place for seafood from now on in Providence! Can't wait to return.
December 6, 2014|Mainer|5|Really the best seafood restaurant in New England Very Very good Keep up the good work
December 6, 2014|Great find|5|Our son recommended Hemenways after dining there during Restaurant Week. The food was delicious and the wait staff was helpful and efficient.
December 6, 2014|Birthday Celebration|5|Visit was to celebrate a 30th birthday. Food was delicious and server was attentive, without interrupting our conversation. All the seafood we had was outstanding...Hemenway's can always be relied on to be consistent.
December 5, 2014|Great food and service|5|We were greeted warmly by the host and brought to a nice table in a quiet looking over the river. Our server Diane knew the menu well and was able to guide us to some excellent choices. Food came out hot and was perfectly timed. If you're in providence you must put this at the top of your list.
December 5, 2014|Went for local fish and seafood. Delighted.|5|Came recommended and we were happy. Had several of the lobster dishes which were wonderful. I would go back if I was in the area.
December 3, 2014|Gluten Free|5|Ordered from the gluten free menu and loved everything! Had the Manhattan chowder and was delighted that it came with piping hot and delicious gluten free biscuits! Ordered the scallops over pea greens with mashed celeriac and thought it was excellent!
November 30, 2014|lobster|4|lobster from the live tank was outstanding. fried calamari was best I have ever tasted and that says a lot......
November 30, 2014|Other reviews warned me|2|Hemenway's appears to be resting on its past history. We went early and sat in a quiet spot off to the side and back. Our server was attentive. All our food, however, was bland and unexciting. My entree arrived barely warm. It was reheated and replated, but that is always disappointing and disrupts the flow of the meal. There are much better dining choices available in lovely Providence.
November 29, 2014|A dining experience unlike any other..|5|I spent this weekend in RI for Water Fire with my boyfriend and this was one of the most memorable weekends either of us have had. Aside from Water Fire being incredibly beautiful and romantic, dinner was superb, outstanding and worthy of a single tear. Firstly, the space is seemingly perfect for most occasions. I kept looking around and found it refreshing to have a booth which felt cozy for our romantic evening, but also a great choice for large parties (of which there were several), date night, girls/guys night (there are tvs), a decent bar area, and I suspect they have tables outside seasonally. NOISE level:energetic, but my boyfriend and I were not screaming at each other by any means. LIGHTING: Dim enough for ambiance, not so dim I needed a flashlight (i'm only 36, but some places are like dining in a cave) and the food: LOBSTER BISQUE:CHUNKS OF IDENTIFIABLE LOBSTER, I think i tasted sherry and let it be said, if you've never considered lobster bisque for dessert, you will.Best bisque I've ever had. We had a couple of oysters, I have never seen an oyster this huge in all my life. Even the few grains of sand in mine was hardly a bother, it was still tasty-and I do not like raw oysters! I was surprised we were not offered bread, but considering everything else, again,a minor slight. My boyfriend's SEAFOOD CASSEROLE, my SEAFOOD PASTA-both divine. The toasted garlic slice that accompanied my pasta was soft, crisp,buttery, the sauce was perfectly spiced, the amount of seafood in my dish was glorious. my boyfriend's casserole was this creamy dish of marine perfection, seemingly small, but heartier than he initially thought. Hemenways should give classes to other restaurants: The scallops melted in our mouths. LEMON POPPY SEED BREAD PUDDING: with the small scoop of raspberry sorbet..this is how the Royals must dine. James, a manager, inquired how we were& I wanted to hug him. Ii am so happy we are just in Boston & am already planning our next visit to Hemenways
November 28, 2014|When we arrived at the restaurant at 10p...|1|When we arrived at the restaurant at 10pm, the restaurant was closed. When I called back the next day, I was told that the restaurant had, indeed, closed early as it was quiet. I left my name and phone number for a response from the manager, but, have not heard from them. I had given my cell # on the on-line reservation, but never heard from the restaurant that they were closing early. I was pretty annoyed because I had chosen that specific time for after a show at PPAC.
November 23, 2014|Family get together with delicious food|5|I used to live in Rhode Island and had never gone here. I now regret my decision! I missed out on the great food and service.
November 22, 2014|One of the best restaurants in town|5|We took friends from out of town to Hemenway's because they wanted local seafood. The oysters were fantastic, and everybody loved the Paella. Service and ambiance were great as always.

November 18, 2014|Disappointing|3|Very nice ambiance but food was sub par. My appetizer of clams casino came out in minutes and it was obvious that it was pre -done and just heated up. It was suffocated with bread crumbs which detracted from the dish and was not good. My paella order was also another mass produced item that lacked flavor and was disappointing. An inexperienced bar tender also made the mistake of serving my RobRoy with a cherry instead of a lemon twist. No big deal, but a high end place should know better. When in Providence I usually go to the Capital Grill, but tried Hemingways for a change. Capital Grill is better
November 16, 2014|We were treated so well.|5|Wait staff and food are impeccable. Rose petals on the table were a fantastic touch to our anniversary dinner. I also like that deviates dad had a great vocabulary.
November 16, 2014|Great for Sunday brunch!|4|Hemenway's doesn't have a special brunch menu--they serve their full dinner menu all day. But their bottles of wine are all half-priced! This makes for a great deal! And the food is great too! They always have a wonderful selection of oysters. Great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.
November 15, 2014|Not so good|2|Unfortunately, as much as we were looking forward to going to Hemenway's,we were very disapointed. We were seated in the main dining room, center aisle. It was like being in the middle of Rt. 95! Waitstaff going back and forth, very distracting. The noise level is beyond tolerable. It was difficult to have a conversation between the noise and the travelling wait staff! My scallops were just about cooked through and luke warm, almost had to send them back and at $30.00 for 5 scallops, it was overall disappointing. My wife's baked stuff shrimp had almost no flavor although the description of the stuffing sounded great. Once again, not hot enough. I believe this restaurant is taking on too many diners and cannot properly handle the volume. they also need to find a way to quiet down the noise level in the main dining room and re-arrange the seating so it's not like being treated like cattle. Won't be back!
November 14, 2014|Disappointed|3|Hadn't been for a few years. Went for a special occasion. Service was great. Food fell short of expectations. Fish cooked appropriately but bland taste. Better options for restaurants if seafood is your desire. Sorry, just don't see the draw of this restaurant anymore.:(
November 13, 2014|Great seafood|5|Great oysters and the freshest seafood. Also great view of providence river
November 9, 2014|Fabulous meal before the show at PPAC.  ...|5|Fabulous meal before the show at PPAC. The seafood was fresh and uniquely prepared. Block Island swordfish grilled and served over arugula risotto with a putanesca sauce and seafood paella were both delicious. The caesar salad was prepared with homemade dressing and anchovies - the best I've had in a long time. Bottled wine was half price on Sundays with an entree. Wonderful meal at a window table with great service. We will definitely go again.
November 8, 2014|Great Seafood|5|We were in town visiting our daughter at college and we really wanted a great seafood restaurant and we found it . It was the last night of Water Fire. The scene was beautiful and the neighborhood was alive. Service was great and so was our meal.
November 8, 2014|The place to be for Waterfire!|3|The place was hopping and we had a great table for 7 by the window. The bartender made a great blood orange martini and table service was excellent as well. The only thing that could have been better was the fish...a little dry and the kitchen ran out of Brussels sprouts. We'll try again when it's not quite so busy.
November 8, 2014|Nice Lunch|5|We had the seafood sampler, expensive but excellent. Very fresh oysters, clams, lobster and giant shrimp. The home made lobster ravioli from Venda were nicely prepared and not over cooked. Sauce was very tasty. My wife really enjoyed her pan seared scallops. Again very fresh and just the right amount of searing. Dark brown surface and just barely cooked in the middle. Seafood is always fresh and well prepared.
November 8, 2014|What a wonderful surprise.  Never been t...|5|What a wonderful surprise. Never been there before. Everything was perfect. Can't wait to go back!
November 7, 2014|good seafood|4|I thought all the fish was quite fresh. I had the seafood over pasta. The menu said it included pieces of lobster. I did not see any. However, the shellfish and swordfish were very good. All in all a very good meal. Not an inexpensive meal.
November 7, 2014|Waitstaff was exceptional and especially...|5|Waitstaff was exceptional and especially attentive; food was terrific and nice view of the river; valet parking was convenient and made parking easy; would highly recommend
November 7, 2014|Excellent Food & Ambience|5|Being in RI to visit our son at URI in Kingston, we decided to come to Providence for dinner. We saw great reviews for Hemenway's so we thought we would try it out. We arrived early so we had a drink at the bar. The bartenders were very friendly and helpful with wine recommendations. There were several people at the bar eating, which looked wonderful. When our whole party arrived (we were 7) we were brought to our table. Our waiters Jordan and Ethan were delightful, charming, helpful with menu choices. We were all thrilled with our meals - stuffed lobster (4), special of local scallops(2), lobster mac-n-cheese, seafood salad. Delicious, good portions, lovely presentation. We would definitely come again when in Prov.
November 6, 2014|Great dinner!|5|We had dinner prior to a show at Providence Performing Arts Center and it was a great experience! It started with free parking in the garage next door. We had a delicious bacon wrapped scallop appetizer before dinner. Nice variety on the Wines by the Glass list. For dinner we order a pot roast dish and a baked scrod dish. Both were great! Good house salad although I would have preferred more of the mixed greens and less of the iceberg. House dressing is good! (Honey Curry)
November 4, 2014|Customer Service|5|I was celebrating my birthday. My waiter was outstanding. He was attentive and made sure that we were told when our meal was to come out. He was very knowledgeable with the food menu and wine list and assisted my husband and I in selecting a wonderful tasting wine. He was detailed and explained where the seafood came from. I have food allergies and he notified the staff. I was very comfortable and at ease with ordering my meal. The restaurant manager made a point to come to my table to reassure me that my food would be prepared safely. This allowed me to relax and enjoy my birthday celebration. The view was amazing, window table overlooking the river.
November 1, 2014|Definitely a highlight|5|Excellent food, my husband and I were both pleased with our entrees (grilled scallops and fried whole-belly clams) and soups (Hemenway's clam chowder and lobster bisque), and the oysters were also delightful. For dessert, the créme brûlée is a must-try. Our waitress was attentive, and making our reservations through OpenTable gave us fantastic seats by the river. A note for travelers: There is a parking garage next to the restaurant with free valet parking for three hours if you have the host/ess at Hemenway's validate your valet ticket before returning to the garage to get your vehicle. Otherwise, you're at the mercy of street parking. Overall, great food, a great experience, and the quality is worth the price tag.
November 1, 2014|Loved the appetizers|3|We had a party of four on a Saturday night with a 7:30 reservation. We had a drink at the bar (hibiscus bellini -- yum) and were seated promptly. The wait staff was excellent and attentive but not annoyingly so. We ordered the seafood sampler app, a half dozen oysters and the antipasti. The appetizers were outstanding!! We should have stopped there. My husband enjoyed his paella and said it was very good. I had the seafood pasta, which was a huge disappointment. I've had this dish at many other restaurants, and this was probably the worst I've ever had. I had two clams, one of which was empty, maybe 5 mussels and maybe 3 medium size shrimp. I would never order this again. My girlfriend had the crab legs. She said they were good.
October 31, 2014|Over priced.  Over rated.|1|ordered 2.5 lb lobster. Lobster meat came but up in a bowl. Potatoes cheap like boxed potatoes. Never saw lobster shell. About 8 small pieces of lobster in bowl. Bill was $170 for 2 including 4 drinks and 1 other 2.0 lb lobster. Will not recommend to anyone. Would love to get some of my money back.
October 31, 2014|Special Night|5|We had very nice Friday night dining experience at Hemenway's. Food was superb as was the service. This is such a reliable and delicious spot in Providence. The lump crab appetizer is so fresh and amazing we had to order 2!
October 26, 2014|We were there for the first time and lov...|5|We were there for the first time and loved the treatment! Food was excellent, the view great but, mostly our waitress, Theresa, made the experience special!
October 25, 2014|Very pleased|5|We were seated right away. Our server Nancy was amazing & patient & informative. Great ambiance!! We will be back.
October 25, 2014|We enjoyed our time at this restaurant. ...|4|We enjoyed our time at this restaurant. It was a good selection considering its location near the Water Fire activities, the fine preparation and preparation of the food and the attentive and courteous service. The restaurant is well appointed but a little crowded and noisy. The location is convenient to Brown University and an easy walk from there for us.
October 24, 2014|Wonderful|5|My family and I visited Rhode Island for the day and decided to dine at Hemenway's based upon the Open Table reviews. The food and service were outstanding. The stuffed lobster, lobster macaroni and cheese, and key lime pie are highly recommended. If I return to Rhode Island, Hemenway's will be a no brainer for dinner.
October 23, 2014|It doesn't get better than this|5|As a thank you to my mom, I took her here, because of her love of seafood. Needless to say, she was thrilled by the experience from the first pour of water by our very knowledgable server, to the end of the evening which resulted in the delicious cheesecake. Not one thing was wrong, nothing was out of place, and it was nice to see that the staff throughout the evening came to check in and make sure that the entire experience was perfect.
October 22, 2014|Excellent seafood, great service|5|Everything about this restaurant was wonderful. My wife and I enjoyed the phenomenal seafood and sampled Hemenways' own beer, was which fantastic. A great night and a memorable honeymoon experience.
October 18, 2014|great food, but...|4|The food is always reliably good here, but not only was it very noisy Sat nite(probably to be expected), but they were out of the special by just after 6 p.m. Also, our waitress was nice, but a bit discombobulated, forgetting responses to things she had already asked us, bringing us back the wrong card, etc. .
October 17, 2014|Best lobster ever. The lobster was serve...|5|Best lobster ever. The lobster was served fisherman style stuffed with whole scallops, shrimp, and the claw meat. Excellant service. A great dining experience.
October 17, 2014|The service here is always impeccable - ...|5|The service here is always impeccable - friendly, professional and just the right amount of attention. The quality of the dishes is high and presentation is lovely.
October 16, 2014|Seafood Dinner Perfection|5|Absolutely the best choice for seafood in Providence. Each part of the meal was delicious in its own right. The service was spectacular. The waiter recommended an amazing swordfish dish that was just what I didn't know I wanted. We are looking forward to dining their again.
October 12, 2014|Fantastic Place!!|5|By far one of the best seafood meals I have eaten in a long time!!!
October 11, 2014|Great seafood|4|Excellent lobster/crab cakes. Excellent service with kid friendly server.
October 11, 2014|Good but not great!|3|Based upon reviews and recommendations I expected more. Food was good but not great. One member of the party had cold fish. No bread brought to table. Desserts were average.
October 11, 2014|Disappointed|2|We chose to order off the prix fixe menu, which had some nice selections, and was a good value. Unfortunately, the restaurant was very unaccommodating when it came to swapping out one vegetable for another. I wanted to substitute kale and spaghetti squash for the asparagus or spinach that was offered on the other meals. We were told that was not possible. When my meal came, I found out that it was very possible. The vegetables had no special sauces or presentation - they were what they were. My sole was overstuffed and very salty. The flavor of the fish was completely lost. The key lime pie for dessert was so tart I couldn't eat it. A dish of Sourpatch Kids would have been equal. Very poor experience for a very expensive place.
October 11, 2014|Memorable Anniversary Dinner|5|We made a reservation on a Waterfire evening to celebrate our anniversary. We had let them know ahead that it was a special evening and they were wonderful. Great table, rose petals, fantastic service and delicious food.
October 9, 2014|Lunch with friends|5|A window seat overlooking the river. What more is their to ask for having lunch with friends on a sunny afternoon. Maybe, able to linger and converse over a fine lunch with wine. Memories are made on occasions like this. It was just a perfect afternoon.
October 6, 2014|Hemenway's cuisine was prepared to perfe...|4|Hemenway's cuisine was prepared to perfection -- our plates were spotless after we enjoyed our meal :) The prices were reasonable. The bright, spacious, open ambience was relaxing and conducive to casual conversation. Definitely a place that is a return-to-venue any time I am in Providence. If you love fresh seafood, it's nearly impossible to beat. The neighborhood is also lovely for an after-lunch or after-dinner walk. If your guests are from out-of-town, Hemenway's is easy off-easy on relative to either I-195 or I-95.
Dined on October 5, 2014|Expensive, and just not that good.|1|I find that there are restaurants that have very trendy menus, are very expensive and just aren't that good. It's a seafood place (there are numerous in Rhode Island), and the entire meal (including tartar sauce and cocktail sauce) were just bland. The server was great. It's too expensive for what we got. But even at a less expensive price I wouldn't recommend it. There are just toooooooo many places in Rhode Island and Southern Mass to get fantastic seafood.
October 5, 2014|Great anniversary dinner!|5|My girlfriend and I came with my parents to celebrate their anniversary. I let Hemenway's know ahead of time and our table was adorned with rose petals on arriving and we were treated to a round of champagne, on the house for my parents. Dinner was fantastic all around and the service was great. Definitely recommend.
October 3, 2014|Excellent!!|5|Excellent food and great service!! My boyfriend and I are serious foodies, and we like to try various things so we end up ordering lots of appetizers. The fig stuffed with goat cheese wrapped with bacon was one of our favorites! Highly recommend the blood orange martini as well... and ask about the pineapple infused vodka! Overall a great experience and would absolutely go back
October 3, 2014|Waitress service|2|First, a waitress served us. Her attitude was not bad. However, after her serving water and drink, no one came to our table for 10 min. I wanted to order wine and waived at her several times when she was passing our table. She looked at me but ignored and passed me without saying anything or changing her expression. Ten min later another waitress showed up to take orders. It might be because the first waitress was supposed to serve just drinks. However, we were not informed of anything and were kept waiting for some one to serve us. I had chosen your restaurant because service quality had been high before then and had parties with my students and researchers working for me. I feel quite discouraged to continue to do so.
October 2, 2014|Disappointed!|3|"The scallops, special of the day, were delicious and a large portion. The paella, was dry, ""sandy"" and cold, it was taken off the check but the damage was done. The signature coffee was cold, the server said he would bring a warmer one but neglected to tell me he had microwaved and it was now scallding -- I took a sip through the straw and burnt my mouth! We have been here many times, but this was a total disappointment."
October 2, 2014|Great service|5|Our server, Theresa, made our girls night out a great experience. The food was great, she was so attentive, and let us take our time to catch up and enjoy! We did not feel rushed and were able to enjoy our food and table talk. Will definitely visit again soon! Always have a wonderful experience!
September 28, 2014|Unexpectedly romantic|5|"My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and decided the evening before that we would go all out and have a fancy dinner on a Sunday. So, when I made the reservation on OpenTable, I wrote ""Anniversary"" in the special comments section, just for kicks. Hemenway's took it to heart. Rose petals on the table, champagne on the house...if you want to impress your lady, bring her here and pass it all off as your idea. Food was delightful, service was great, and Sundays = half-off bottles of wine. We had a gift card from a while back to use so we felt free to indulge, but if you do not have a gift card, expect a little bit of sticker shock when the bill comes. For a special experience like this, though, it was worth it."
September 27, 2014|Best seafood at River Fire Event|4|Have been to other restaurants in area during River Fire and this is the best by far. Easy to get to, parking plentiful, wait staff was very good, got there early and took us in, would visit again.
September 27, 2014|Great time!|5|We dine at Hemenway's every time we come to Providence to experience Waterfire. The food is excellent, especially the baked stuffed shrimp! The view is great as well as convenient parking that can be validated after dining. Every time we have been to Hemenway's our waiter/waitress has been friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. Perfect location to begin or end your evening!!
September 27, 2014|Outstanding Food & Service!|5|This was our first visit to Hemenway's, as we chose this as our anniversary dinner spot. Very romantic and great views of Waterfire. The food was amazing! The crab cake appetizer is so delicious & the raw bar was the freshest I've ever had, great wine list, stuffed lobster and filet dinner was cooked perfectly, & our server Steve was fabulous! He was very attentive & made our overall experience perfect! Very reasonably priced. We can't wait to come back again! This is the BEST seafood restaurant we have ever been to! I wish we lived closer, but it's well worth the 1.5 hour drive from CT. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Providence that wants an upscale dining experience.
September 27, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|Excellent service and fantastic food. Went Waterfire after dinner. Thanks.
September 27, 2014|the food and service were both exception...|5|the food and service were both exceptional. the waitstaff are to be commended !
September 26, 2014|Uncharacteristically Disappointing|2|I usually love Hemenway's, but this visit was disappointing. They used to have really good rolls, but our waiter informed us that they changed them about six month's ago. I prefer the previous ones. And by the way, we had to ask for them. Also, they now have flavored their butter, which I didn't care for. Finally, my Caesar Salad had an excessive amount of dressing. On a positive note, when the waiter found out my friend was celebrating her birthday, he brought her a piece of cake. That was a nice touch, but overall it was not their best effort.
September 21, 2014|Great !|5|A great restaurant with an excellence service an impressive wine list and the best seafood of Providence !
September 21, 2014|Consistant|5|We dine hear a lot and its always great food and people.The only thing that changes is the server this time we had Morgan and she was outstanding and you cant beat the Sunday wine special all bottles half price
September 19, 2014|Consistently Great!!|5|One of our Favorite restaurants in RI. Always good food and the service always excellent. Tonight we took a friend who had food allergies. Our server Morgan was very attentive and accommodating. The Chef's prepared his Paella perfectly and he was assured of it's clean ingredients. Seafood is their specialty, but I had the Surf & Turf. The NY Sirloin was cooked perfectly.
September 17, 2014|Repeat Customer!!!|4|Great location and Food is always excellent. Great Seafood!! Service was very attentive and not rushed. Great for business meeting.
September 14, 2014|Excellent dinner!|4|This was our first time dining at Hemenway's. Extensive menu and a lovely wine list. Excellent, attentive service. We started with a 1/2 dozen local oysters that were wonderful. The Venda Lobster Agnolotti was very tasty and very rich. The Alaska King Crab Legs were a significant disappointment in both quality and presentation and were returned to the kitchen. The dish simply did not meet expectations. The restaurant manager was at our table immediately and was most understanding and gracious. The George's Bank Sea Scallops were the replacement order and were absolutely fabulous. Perfectly prepared, attractively plated and exceptionally flavorful. We will be returning to Hemenway's to explore more of the menu.
September 14, 2014|overpriced and poor service|2|"Went to Hemenway's on a moderately busy Sunday night. Dinner service was excruciatingly slow and for extended periods of time our waitress disappeared completely. Two and a half hours for dinner, including a 20 minute wait for cappuccino because ""the steamer was in heavy use"". Out came the dessert - a scoop of ice cream - that had melted so much if I was the waiter I would have been embarrassed to bring to a customer. of course when I rejected it, it was replaced without question - and without apology. The bill was among the most I have spent on dinner in Providence. And the food only OK. I would stay away - significantly better places exist in Providence - there is no reason to come here."
September 13, 2014|Definitely go again|4|Food was good, ordered the New York Strip, and my wife had the stuffed lobster. Steak was cooked perfectly, served on a bed of mashed potatoes. I'm wold the lobster was phenomenal, with the stuffing including very large, whole scallops, as well as crab. Served with a chosen side of fries that were not touched due to the size of the lobster. Beer list was decent. Nothing to write home about, but they definitely make sure to have a good selection of craft beers including local brews. While the food was very good, it was the service that made the place. Waitress was extremely attentive, brought the lobster to the kitchen to crack it after my wife cut herself. Even brought out Champagne when she found out we were celebrating our anniversary.
September 12, 2014|Food, location, service|5|Very good food, along the river in Providence. Fantastic service.
September 12, 2014|One of my favorites|5|Always provide outstanding service, excellent high quality food, but it is not cheap but worth the trip. Nice to splurge once and while.
September 12, 2014|Business Lunch|4|"Took a visiting job applicant to business lunch at Hemenway's mid week. Table overlooking waterview as requested, knowledgeable and attentive service, including black napkins to ""avoid lint"" from the white napkins on our suits -- nice touch! We sampled local oysters from the raw bar which were some of the biggest and freshest I have ever tasted, along with jumbo shrimp cocktail. Excellent clam chowder and delicious entrees including lobster salad plate and seafood broil. Would certainly recommend for lunch and the parking was valet in the adjacent garage which made the visit quick, easy, and professional."
September 12, 2014|Dine with a view|5|Great spot, can sit inside on canal, or outside by park. Very relaxing and fabulous food.
September 11, 2014|Anniversary dinner|3|We were looking forward to a dinner out for our 4th year anniversary. We have 4 month old twin boys and don't get out much. My husband ordered the lobster special which was very good. At the suggestion of the waitress I ordered the pork chop. It came out raw, not just under cooked, but raw. The waitress took the piece of pork back to the kitchen. When it was returned to me it was then over cooked, not a bit of pink at all. I did not want to send it back a second time so I kept it. My meal was very disappointing and not enjoyable. I mentioned it to the waitress and we were compensated with a free desert to go. By the time we got home the whipped cream with the desert had melted into the cake. I didn't enjoy desert either.
September 11, 2014|Awesome restaurant|5|Absolutely recommend to my friend. Everything is great, food, service, and view. Also, has a delicious seafoods and desserts.
September 9, 2014|Birthday dinner|3|It always bothers us when your food arrives and it is poorly executed. Unfortunately one of the dinners arrived overdone. The baked stuffed shrimp were tough and dried out. The restaurant was freezing on the evening we were there and the beautiful assorted seafood appetizer platter was not as hot as we would have liked. All of our salads were good but that is not why you go out to dinerOur waitress did an outstanding job and made the evening feel like a birthday celebration !!!
September 7, 2014|Great food and service|5|Four of us dined at Hemenway's on a Sunday afternoon. The attention to detail was superb. The meals were great and the chef made sure to take into account food allergies that two of us had in preparing our meals. Oysters, the Paella and the George's Bank Sea Scallops marinated in beets were all delicious. The 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday gave us no excuse to sample from their large wine list. A pleasant afternoon spent in Providence.
September 6, 2014|Great Choice|5|Found this restaurant on Trip Advisor and chose it because of the seafood reviews. I had scallops and they were sweet and tasty! The restaurant honored my Open Table request for a table by the window with a river view. I was very appreciative.
September 6, 2014|Usually a better experience|3|Service was rushed. Fried clams were gooey. Chef's special was excellent. Usually a much nicer experience. I'll definitely go back as this is one of my favorite restaurants. Maybe just a bad night.
September 5, 2014|Too many good places to pic this|2|Wait staff not attentive and food over cooked. For the prices - while not exorbitant but but not cheap - it was not worth the money. Shrimp and lobster if not frozen were very over cooked, tough, and rubbery. A medium rare steak was well done. And never once asked how our food was or if we wanted additional beverages. Used to be a favorite, and not at all indicative of their normal food and service. We won't be back - too many other good local choices.
September 5, 2014|Good decent seafood restaurant|4|Went to Hemenway's on a friend's recommendation. Booked through the OpenTable app at 7:15 for an 8:00 pm reservation. The place was full when we arrived, and still were seated at 8:00, the time of our reservation. Table for two was a tad too small, as in many restaurants today. Service was excellent. Food was good, although not a culinary experience, but then again we were not in Paris. Hemenway's is a good decent restaurant, probably as good as they come in Providence. I will certainly return whenever I am in Providence.
September 5, 2014|not as good as the first time|3|Returned after an excellent first visit, but not quite the same. The paella was skimpy. The service was just ok. Felt rushed by the waiter, maybe because of lack of experience. Not a busy Friday night. A long way from Southborough, MA to fall beyond expectations. We like the ambience and décor. May return.
September 5, 2014|Service was way off|3|Heminway's has been my go to spot for businesses lunches for about 3 years. I'm usually there at least 4 times per month, and its typically quite reliable. Unfortunately at my last visit this week, our waiter, a tall gentleman in his 40, was noticeably gruff, and clearly not very happy with his job that day. Working on his time table and not ours, he would consistently approach our table and interrupt our conversations with no attempt to ease in or to gently get our attention. It was very intrusive to the business discussion and felt more like the service at a diner in Queens that an upscale restaurant anywhere. Disappointing.
September 1, 2014|Will Be Back Again|5|Our daughter is a student at Brown and Hemenway's has become a favorite stop during our visits. The fish is what the restaurant is known for, so that is what I order. During our most recent visit I had two types of raw oysters - - chosen with the advice of our waiter. Both were extremely fresh and flavorful. Speaking of our waiter, he was present without being overbearing and very knowledgeable. We were fortunate enough to have a table by the water and the views at night are lovely. We will be back again, I am sure.
August 31, 2014|It was a very nice night out service was...|4|It was a very nice night out service was great and very helpful totally enjoyed the experience will go back again

August 30, 2014|Great food and superb service!|5|Everything was excellent! We dined here for our 6th wedding anniversary and we could not have had a better time! It was nice of the restaurant to decorate our table with rose petals and offer us a complimentary champagne toast to start off our night! Jordan our waiter was excellent! We never had to ask for anything, he was always a step ahead! Our apps, dinner entrees and dessert were all excellent and very well portioned for the price! Their lobster bisque is always amazing and they have a great wine selection! I would definitely reccomend hemenways for a romantic night out or for a great meal with friends!
August 30, 2014|Great food, desserts, and raw bar|5|We luncheoned here for daughters our 21st birthday. Great choice, as she is a culinary arts student and takes restaurant experiences with an eye (and stomach) for detail. She had lobster ravioli, which the waiter described as fresh pasta with a creamy, but light sauce. A+ description and flavor. Our appetizer was bacon-wrapped scallops. I asked for well-done bacon, but tender scallops. Another A+. My wife and daughter had creme brulee, and i had flour-less chocolate cake. The cake was free, 'cause it was her birthday. The cake was delicious, some whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and a strawberry. Brulee surprise! 3 flavors, each delicious and cooked perfectly. The decor was a bit dark but tempered by the river view. 4/4 stars.
August 29, 2014|Excellent in every respect!!|5|My favorite restaurant so far during this visit to Providence! Food, service and atmosphere all top notch! Guaranteed you won't be disappointed.
Dined on August 27, 2014|First time at Hemenway's|5|Enjoyed our first visit to Hemenway's! Good atmosphere with great food and service.
August 27, 2014|Beautiful place!|4|Excellent food! lovely place with view to the river
August 24, 2014|always outstanding|5|Been to all the so-called seafood specialty places and often disappointed, but never disappointed with Hemenway's - rarely can you say that everything is great like this. parking-service-preparation-quality-seafood-steak-dessert (creme brulee trio!)-coffees... Our go-to restaurant for special occasions, family groups, or just because.
August 24, 2014|Definitely a favorite of Providence|4|Food and ambience were great! You won't be disappointed
August 24, 2014|Special orders don't upset us...|5|I needed a special restaurant for a very special 80 th birthday celebration. The guest of honor needed a puréed meal. Heather at Hemenway's was so knowledgeable and helpful. She informed all the staff who served us what was needed and we had a wonderful and 'normal'dinner!!! Thank you so much to everyone at Hemenway's, especially Heather!!!
August 23, 2014|Very good food but fair service|4|This was our second visit to Hemenway's. The food was quite good; however, the service was not what it should have been. We had to constantly remind our server to bring items we requested including bread. We asked for separate checks (party of 4) which was forgotten about. I had the seafood pasta which was a large dish full of delicious seafood. My wife had fried scallops which she liked very much. We were disappointed with the lack of creativity from the bar when asked for a special martini. Not so sure I would rush back given the many other options in Providence.
August 23, 2014|Water Fire Night|5|A memorable visit to a vibrant restaurant with good food and wine,
August 23, 2014|Hemenways|5|Bill, our server was very attentive. Loved rose petals on table! All apps and entrees were delicious! Great location for Waterfire!
August 23, 2014|Great Night Out|5|We had a lovely dinner before enjoying Providence's unique Waterfire. Very glad we had reservations. There was a long line at the door shortly after we arrived. The restaurant has a very high ceiling which makes the space feel much more voluminous, and helps mitigate the noise, too, I expect. The room feel larger than it is, but in a good way. The food was excellent. She had grilled swordfish and I opted for the seared tuna. It was served very rare, as requested. Danny, our waiter was terrific. A quick sense of humor to match his attentive service. And nice recommendations, too.
August 23, 2014|Thanks for a great experience Danny|5|Food was awesome, but Hemmenways never disappoints.
August 23, 2014|The salads were better than the hot dish...|2|The salads were better than the hot dishes. We order two salads - one with crab, one with yellowfin tuna. We order two hot dishes - clams and linguine, and fried clams - both were way too salty.

August 20, 2014|Seafood Delight|5|Great Seafood, Atmosphere. and Service. Can't go wrong.
August 18, 2014|Fabulous service and food|5|Our server Hollie was fantastic, very attentive but not overbearing. We had the seafood tower, 1/2 price on Mondays, all very fresh and tasty. One of the best restaurants in Providence.
August 17, 2014|Fabulous Experience|5|"We celebrated my brother's 60th birthday on a recent Sunday afternoon. They provided a lovely private table that let our party have an intimate dining experience. My sister who was earliest to arrive and found out it was my brother's ""special"" birthday, and asked the management if they could provide a fabulous cake for dessert. The kitchen informed the maître D ' that all cakes had already been prepared for the day and we're not able to help with this request. The manager said he could send out to a nearby bakery and sent staff to get one. My sister was bowled over. The service and food were more than splendid. I keep going back because the restaurant accommodates your every wish to make your dining experience one to remember!"
August 16, 2014|Must Do|5|"If you are in Providence you simply must eat at Hemenway's. The quality of the food was exceeded only by the quality of the service. If you're looking for a ""special"" night out go to Hemenway's. You won't be disappointed !!!!"
August 15, 2014|Service was excellent|5|Had a great experience. Bill, our server was outstanding. Food was great. They timed it perfectly I between meals and appetizers.
August 15, 2014|Exceptional from beginning to end!|5|My wife and I went to Hemenway's on date night the other night. Our expectations were low as we have had a hard time finding good restaurants lately. What a pleasant surprise! From the time we walked in to the time we left, it was nothing but exceptional, exceptional service, exceptional drinks, exceptional appetizers, exceptional meals (the swordfish special was amazing) and exceptional deserts. The price was in line with what I would expect for this level of restaurant, but the difference was Hemenway's is well worth it! We now have a new favorite restaurant.
August 15, 2014|KELLY IS THE BEST SERVER EVER!|5|Had such a wonderful time celebrating my boss' birthday. Service was excellent and food was out of this world.
August 13, 2014|Fresh local seafood, good ambience.|5|This restaurant features locally harvested oysters and clams, but also offers a wide array of fish. I recommend the beet-marinated scallops. Nice wine selection.
August 13, 2014|Perfect for seafood in Providence|4|"Great location and nice view of the river. Service attentive. Food is reliable and good...not over the top ""gourmet"" but really good fresh seafood. Dinner was a bit loud for me as I usually go at lunch. They respond when you have a concern (last time we noted the creme brulee didn't have a good consistency nor was it properly ""bruleed""...this time...perfect. We were impressed they really listened. Calamari outstanding...oysters (raw and my favorite, Hemenway's style) are the reason we keep on going back. Worth the trip and return."
August 10, 2014|Nice spot|5|This is an all round restaurant. It can serve any occasion, and it has for me. We have been for a nice Saturday night, as well as a good Sunday afternoon.
August 9, 2014|A+ Dinner Spot for Waterfire|5|Hemenway's is located at the end of Waterfire and next to Starry Night, so it was easy to go early and enjoy Waterfire before dinner. And parking is validated by Hemenway's, so I think I paid $3 for three hours of valet parking (not counting tip). The Menu was excellent and the food was superb. All in all, it was very easy to pull off a wonderful evening despite the huge crowds of people downtown.
August 9, 2014|A Great Dinner - Start to Finish!|5|Promptly seated at a window table for our 8:15 reservation on a Waterfire Saturday night! Special menu at $35 for a three-course meal was a nice addition to the regular menu. All four of us were impressed with the food quality, selection and presentation, as well as the fine service. Our meals were perfectly cooked and served at the appropriate temperature, paired with a couple of bottles of reasonably priced wine.
August 9, 2014|Fun and Delicious!|5|Hemenway's never disappoints. There is always a lot of energy. Tthe service and atmosphere are great and the food is always so fresh and well prepared. Our waiter Bill was terrific. His knowledge of the menu and timing were perfect. He knows how to make every patron feel like his most important customer. Cocktails and seafood platter at the bar were also terrific. Just wish the cocktail area was a little bigger. Sometimes hard to find a spot. This is one of our favorite spots for a great night out and for a special celebration.

August 9, 2014|Hemenways  - excellent dining|5|We arrrived on time for our reservation and opted to wait just a few minutes for a seat by the window, which over looks the canal in Providence. We had a front row view of the waterfire boats - loaded with wood and ready to light the fires which are just steps away. The food was outstanding, we had calamari with peppers and tuna appetizers, both cooked perfectly and very tasty. The lobster ravioli, pasta with seafood and scallops were terrific, the vibe at Hemenways is very upbeat but not too loud. Service was excellent too. I would go back in a heartbeat!
August 8, 2014|THE BEST OYSTERS!|5|Amazing choice of local oysters. Very flavorful! Waitress Louise shared her knowledge of food & local events with us. She was very gracious. Would go back in a Rhode Island minute!
August 8, 2014|Never Disappointed|4|Hemenways - you cannot go wrong for seafood or steak. Certainly have enjoyed every meal there.
August 8, 2014|Excellent Seafood|5|Excellent seafood served in a professional manner. Food was fresh and served hot. Something that seems to be difficult for many places. Waitress was competent, friendly and attentive. A little pricey, but you don't seem to mind when the experience is as good as this.
August 7, 2014|Really good food and service|5|Dinning here was a a great experience. Definitely recommend to all.
August 3, 2014|Perfect evening|5|Super fresh seafood! Oysters were amazing, drinks were tasty and our server was very attentive and intuitive to our needs. Will definitely come again
August 2, 2014|Always great|5|Must eat. I have been coming to providence for 18 years and this restaurant has always been great. Great food, great service, great memories.
July 31, 2014|Missed the Boat|2|While the freshness of the seafood was evident, the manner in preperation and culinary vision was lacking. I would recommend it as an adequate choice but nothing more.
July 26, 2014|Loved it !|4|The seafood hot app was excellent, though I prefer a chopped clam casino, the whole clam was a bit chewy. The fried clams were worth the wait. Perfect. Clearly, Hemenways is one of Providence's best.
July 26, 2014|Spectacular!|5|Amazing food, savored every bite. Great variety of menu choices!
July 26, 2014|Fantastic|5|Great seafood and service. Was a perfect find for the night of the water fires.
July 26, 2014|A most pleasant experience|5|"We were a party of 3, and each chose a different entrée. All were very pleased with the choices, the food was great, the servings substantial, and the service very attentive. We had a ""gluten-free"" person, and were surprised at your ""gluten-free"" menu. The flourless chocolate cake was outstanding, as were the other 2 desserts. We will definitely return to Hemenway's."
July 25, 2014|Our all-time favorite|5|Hemenway's was our all-time favorite seafood experience. Linguini with shrimp was delicious. Paella was off-the charts great. Ellie's stuffed shrimp was delectable.
July 24, 2014|Excellent|4|What a great find. My husband and I stopped in after Rhode Island best of party. We had already had too much food. We wanted a meal, or so we thought. After we ordered we realized we were not that hungry. Our waiter was excellent and wrapped our food to take home. The food was great even though we couldn't eat it. Excellent leftovers on Friday night when I didn't want to cook anyway. Great views of the river in downtown Providence. I Highly recommend it.
Dined on July 24, 2014|We had a superb time here, mostly due to...|5|We had a superb time here, mostly due to our waiter, Cory. He made the evening. He paced the meal so we could enjoy our drinks, then our soup and salad, then the main course, without piling everything on top of each other. The food was very good. We splurged and shared a stuffed lobster...very rich! Such an enjoyable experience overall.
July 21, 2014|Go if you have all night...........|2|We went on a Monday night. Sat outside, street view only. Slow Service.....Took 45 minutes by the time we got appetizers and they were crab cakes and oysters from the raw bar. Dinner took forever arrived at 9:45pm.... We had a 7:45 reservation and was finished dinner at 10:30 we did not order dessert. Eaten alive by mosquitoes. I wish the food was worth the wait.
July 21, 2014|Stellar Again|5|We greatly enjoyed Hemenways, the staff stepped up for our special occasion ( we had notified them in advance). It was a beautiful night, great seafood and remarkable service. We have been there dozens of times over the years and they still make it memorable and top shelf.
July 21, 2014|Tasty and sustainable|5|Four of us had dinner at Hemenway's on Monday evening. Started with a selection of exquisitely fresh oysters and top neck clams steamed in white wine, Granny Smith apples, chorizo and herbs. The broth was so good I could have drunk it from the bowl, but settled for dunking my warm crusty bread in it instead, at our waitress's urging. Followed that with a cup of clam chowder thickened with cream rather than the usual flour. Followed that with succulent, sweet whole bellied clams and grilled artichokes. To top it off, all raw bar items were half price with an entree. Exceptional meal with wonderful service provided by a delightful serve named Nancy. Others had fresh fish & we're equally pleased. Next time I'm in Providence, I'll be back!
July 19, 2014|Great spot!|4|We love Hemenways. It's our go to place for a nice night out. Good is always delicious and service is always great
July 19, 2014|Great Place!|5|I had never been to Hemenway's, but it came highly recommended and it was a great experience! We went for a friend's birthday and it was a great place to go. The food was amazing and the wine and drink list was extensive. We went during Providence restaurant week and got a fantastic deal for our meals. I will be going back for sure.
July 19, 2014|had a great meal  went for my wife birth...|5|had a great meal went for my wife birthday very nice
July 18, 2014|Very good!|4|I took my girlfriend for restaurant week and it was amazing, we enjoyed ourselves a lot. Great oysters, a really good prix fixe menu, and a great wine and beer list. Our waitress was very attentive as well, and did a fantastic job.
July 18, 2014|Good food good service but can get food ...|3|Good food good service but can get food just as good and less expensive elsewhere. Not worth spending the money. Even restaurant week. Nothing AMAZING for which I would expect for the price.
July 18, 2014|Best of both worlds|5|I recently dined at Hemenway's for lunch on a warm summer day. Sitting inside in the AC with a view of the river and the park felt like sitting outside without the heat or the noise. The food and drinks were wonderful and a great value on their lunch menu.
July 18, 2014|Outside dining too noisy|2|The outside dining was so noisy with traffic from the street that everyone was almost shouting to be heard. Would never eat outside here again!
July 17, 2014|Taste E|4|Food very tasty. Service very good. Environment very nice.
July 17, 2014|Always a good experience|5|My colleague and I were there for restaurant week, and the food was great--so was the service, right down to asking if I preferred a black napkin so I didn't leave with white lint on my black pants. The food came out quickly and was very flavorful. I highly recommend Hemenways for lunch and ask for a table with a view of the river.
July 16, 2014|Key time pie is amazing, would go back j...|4|Key time pie is amazing, would go back just for that.
July 16, 2014|Amazing as always!|5|My partner and I went to Hemenway's for our 2 year anniversary since this was where we had our first date. They sat us by the large windows with an amazing view of the river next to the restaurant. We ordered off the restaurant week menu; I got the lobster bisque, seared salmon, and chocolate torte, while my partner got clam chowder, surf & turf, and key lime pie. It was all so amazing we cleaned our plates, even the whole 10oz steak! When we told our waitress about our special day, she brought over rose petals and 2 glasses of champagne on the house! She was very attentive and anything we asked for was brought over promptly. Amazing service, great food, and a wonderful night for us; Thank you for a wonderful anniversary Hemenway's!
July 16, 2014|Very much liked|5|Great service and food delicious. Walked to our tour of Brown University from here.
July 13, 2014|Wonderful experience|5|I chose this restaurant to meet with friends to celebrate our boys graduating high school. The good and service was outstanding. The table was located near the front window which allowed us privacy. Overall a terrific experience.
July 13, 2014|Lobster Crab Cakes|5|By far the best crab cakes in the area. Extremely delicious.
July 13, 2014|Close to Brown University|5|We celebrated my sons birthday and had a wonderful experience. The ambience is upscale but not overly formal. All bottles of wine are half off on Sundays. Parking is no problem as there is a garage next door or on street parking if you go for lunch, or valet parking for dinner.
July 12, 2014|Don't Believe All The Hype|2|I would not recommend this place if you are parent traveling with your college student and looking for an excellent meal in Providence, unless you wanted to be treated like a second class citizen. Where your April 2014 table request is not to be honored and the food order is only done half right. But Hemenway's the perfect place for a place where pushing bottles of wine seems to their top priority. The bottom line is while we don’t expect Hemenway’s to be anywhere close to the caliber of restaurants like those in Boston, New York or Newport. One would expect that considering Hemenway’s has the perfect location for foot traffic and is located in the state’s capital. One would hope the commitment to excellence would be their top priority.
July 12, 2014|SLOW and BUSY|4|I booked the table for 6:45. I knew Waterfire began around 8:30. I thought that would be good timing. Instead we did not get finished until 9:30. Our waiter said that the kitchen was very busy. Food was good but not worth the wait.
July 12, 2014|Service is the key|4|We have dined at Hemenways several times, and always find the service to be wonderful.
July 12, 2014|Excellent Evening|5|The excellence started at the door and continued throughout the evening. Our waitress was exceptional... Knowledge of menu, area attractions, choices support, perfection..... Meal was terrific from calamari, chowder, fish and ice cream!
July 11, 2014|Still a great choice for seafood!|4|Fabulous food. This night the service was a tad slow or I would have given a 5 star recommendation. Unfortunately one large table near us was extremely loud, (no fault of the restaurant), which made conversation difficult. We will definitely be back again!
July 11, 2014|1st time dining in Providence|5|Great food and perfectly timed service with a wonderful view. Restaurant had extensive menu - we were seated right by the window overlooking the boating on the water.
July 11, 2014|Mixed Review of Food; good service|3|We started off with a lot of seafood: Great Beau Solei Oysters! Yummy scallops wrapped in bacon. The calamari was okay and the stuffed clams casino were buttery and dry all at the same time. Not really edible and more like sawdust with butter. I had the short rib for dinner, and although very tender, for some reason they put barbeque sauce on it so you really couldn't taste the beefy flavor. My husband's pork chop also had barbeque sauce on it and it really ruined the flavor of the meat. Service by the main servers was very good, but the food runners are mousy. It was our second time here as this place is 4 hours from home. There are better options in Providence.
July 11, 2014|Delocious|5|Wonderful lunch during a Restaurant Week. I hadn't been back I'm about 15 years when I stopped working downtown. It won't be that long again! Because the day was so lovely we chose to,eat outside this the lower scores for ambiance and noise...our choice. I highly recommend this restaurant. Portions were perfect. Fish Tacos and Jonah Crab Salad so fresh. Due to,it's richness the Lobster Bisque, was also a perfect portion. Yummmmm.
July 11, 2014|disappointing experience|2|"I was excited to try Hemenway's since I heard such wonderful things about it. We were greeted by a very friendly and accommodating hostess. However, our server was unfriendly and extremely slow. We ordered the lunch special which includes appetizer, entree and dessert. The salad I ordered was a little wilted and disappointing. The beer battered fish and chips were just ok and the fries were soggy. The ""dessert"" of a ""fresh baked cookie"" was also disappointing. I thought it would have been presented a little better than thrown at us in a plastic bag! I expected so much more. Won't go back."
July 10, 2014|Fresh seafood|4|The view of the river is beautiful. The seafood is so fresh the fish could flip up and hit me. The service was old-fashioned upscale but the ambience was friendly and warm. Lovely.
July 10, 2014|Lunch|4|Had a great lunch. Food and service very good. Had not been here in a while and was pleased with the visit.
July 9, 2014|DINED DURING RESTAURANT WEEK AND IT WAS ...|5|DINED DURING RESTAURANT WEEK AND IT WAS A GREAT VALUE. QUALITY AND SERVING SIZE WERE VERY GOOD.
July 8, 2014|CCbud|4|It's hard to believe, but this was our first time at Hemenway's. We got there a half hour before our scheduled reservation time but were seated immediately (with great view of the river and city beyond). It was Restaurant Week in Providence and the menu was excellent. We too advantage of the extensive wine list and settled down for a relaxing dinner. We eat out often and will definitely return to Hemenway's on our next visit to Providence.
July 6, 2014|A nice restaurant with some great food o...|4|A nice restaurant with some great food on the menu, particularly if you like fish & seafood. Servings are on the heartier side so no need to worry about going hungry afterwards. The service was good; there was a miscommunication regarding our order that was taken care of in a very nice way (it ended up almost adding to the experience rather than take away from it). Next time we'll try and ask for a booth or a table by the windows to enhance the experience (as compared to a table in the middle of the isle). All-in-all a very nice experience and we'll definitely return (soon!).
July 6, 2014|Great seats, window overlooking the park...|4|Great seats, window overlooking the park. Disappointed in our choice of using Restaurant Week Menu. I was not thrilled with the steak, It was tough to chew.

July 5, 2014|First time and my new favorite|5|We went to Hemenways after a show. We were seated right away and was pleasantly surprised to find the tables were not right on top of each other like many city restaurants. Our server was wonderful, attentive but not intrusive. We ordered oysters and let our server pick which ones. They were the best oysters we have had and shucked perfectly! We had the swordfish and mahi mahi. I am very picky about my swordfish and this was one of the best I've had. The asiago potatoes were out if this would and I'd go back just for those alone. The key lime pie was good and I enjoyed the pot of French pressed coffee. I look forward to going back!
July 4, 2014|What a great lunch|5|First time eating at Hemenway's and had lunch on July 4th. Pretty quiet (not unexpected) but enough people to make it interesting. Service was great. The lobster bisque was to die for. Had the fish tacos which were very good. Will definitely return next time we get to Providence.
July 3, 2014|Always delightful|5|Consistently excellent food, service and atmosphere.
July 1, 2014|anniversary|5|Host provided a 25th anniversary desert ( flan ) with rose pedals. Great thought!
June 28, 2014|"Great food 
A little noisy as restaurant..."|5|Great food A little noisy as restaurant got busier Going to view water fires nice view
Dined on June 28, 2014|Great night out|5|We are very happy we chose Hemenway's on the same night Providence had Waterfire. The restaurant is on the water and we were able to see the activities while dining. We were pleasantly surprised to see that this restaurant was offering a special Waterfire menu and it was the choice of everyone at the table. Our waitress was friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and we thoroughly had a great time.
June 28, 2014|The food is always outstanding.|4|Our waitress was very friendly but a little scatterbrained. She kept forgetting things. We took friends who had never been there before and they were very pleased. We drove from Connecticut to have them see Waterfire. They loved it.
June 28, 2014|Good but not great experience|3|We started with oysters Hemenway, a twist on oysters Rockefeller. The oysters themselves were good but the panko bread crumbs were white, not brown from the broiler and there was no visible sauce. The clam chowder was good but little evidence of clams. The fried scallops were a hit, very tender and fried perfect. The seafood on the Caesar salad was very good and a generous serving, the Caesar salad itself was something you would find in a chain restaurant. The server was great - very pleasant and attentive as well as the front desk staff.
June 28, 2014|susan smith|5|Fabulous: every wait detail and food was lovely So easy with Open Table
June 28, 2014|Great Location and food|5|I just happen to find this gem when I was looking for a restaurant near the Fire Water In Providence. I could not believe how nice the place was. We went with another couple and loved it too. There location is right next to where the Fire Water in Providence Starts. We had a table right next to the window overlooking canal. The food was fabulous. Plenty of places to part.
June 28, 2014|Great day out|4|Stopped for dinner at Hemenways. Had not been in a while and enjoyed the fresh seafood, local ingredients and a nice glass of wine. There was a water fire the same night so the service was a tad rushed but we went early enough that we were able to hang around at the end of our meal and talk a bit.
June 28, 2014|Our server, Jason, was fantastic.  We or...|1|Our server, Jason, was fantastic. We ordered many apps and took our time - it was lovely. Because we were eating early before a concert, we even made a reservation for 10pm to return that night!
June 28, 2014|Second times the charm|5|This was our second time here and again the food service and overall atmosphere were top notch !
June 27, 2014|great swordfish|5|the grilled swordfish was excellent: juicy and flavorful. Several recent Yelp reviews said the swordfish was dry, and I beg to differ.
June 26, 2014|Meh|2|In an area known for seafood, the fare was average. Service was overtly insincere and, at best, average. Setting is nice and nice vibe with jazz trio on the patio. But food and service don't recommend Hemenways.
June 25, 2014|Downright yummy!|5|My husband and I shared dinner with a friend. Sharing is always fun as you can sample so many more offerings. The scallops were superb. The side salads fresh. My husband enjoyed the chowder. The salmon was the best of our temptations. Never have lentils been more thoroughly enjoyed. We finished with dessert that just made the meal complete. Next night we returned with our daughter. It was that good.
June 22, 2014|Once again, a winner|5|Hemenway's simply always delivers a superb seafood meal. We've been several times in the last year and we have never been disappointed. The wait staff also is terrific- hard working, attentive, knowledgeable, and without any attitude or airs. The space is on the noisy side, but the tall ceilings accommodate that well. We can't recommend it highly enough!
June 21, 2014|Very nice|5|"Food and ambiance was excellent. Service was great and we were sat quickly. It was 8:30 on a Saturday so we might have missed the ""rush"" but no matter, it was a great dinner and worthy of a return trip. I would reccomend this restaraunt to others who can enjoy seafood."

June 20, 2014|Forget the top neck clams|3|The top neck clam appetizer was tasty but the clams were too tough to chew.
June 18, 2014|Hemenway's in the afternoon|5|My husband and I were married in the City of Providence and went to Hemenway's for lunch afterword. We took my parents and enjoyed a delicious luncheon. We have been there several times since. Last week we celebrated our 4 year anniversary there. The food was delicious, the wait staff was impeccable. We will be back again.
June 18, 2014|Consistently excellent|5|We always have a delightful experience. Top notch food and service.
June 15, 2014|Great for Father's Day and...|5|Took my husband here for Father's Day, we had been here a few years ago on an anniversary weekend. Food was great as always and although I have a soybean allergy, they were accomodating.
June 15, 2014|The seafood was very, very fresh and del...|5|The seafood was very, very fresh and delicious. We shared three appetizers which were all outstanding. The salad entrees were terrific with very tasty seafood. Great Bloody Mary.
June 14, 2014|Salty|5|Seating was fast and the food came faster. They made a mistake on my dish but it was replaced and made exactly how i wanted. We had a great waitress that kept pouring my bottle of moėt with out me having to ask. Great place great atmosphere, aside from a few people that were also dining felt like they was in my business with a salty face because they couldn't eat as good as me and my date.
June 14, 2014|What Happened?|2|I have always looked forward to excellent food at Hemenway's but was disappointed on this last occasion. From appetizer, salad, entree, the food was mediocre. I had forgotten how loud the restaurant can be and our table of four had some difficulty hearing each other over the noise. It was a very busy night and the service was slow and inattentive at the beginning of the meal, when you most want the service. It was obvious that the restaurant overbooked. The view is wonderful, if you get a window table. It will be a while before I return.
June 14, 2014|Excellent|5|Great restaurant with excellent service and fantastic food!
June 14, 2014|Best Seafood|5|Been to a lot of seafood places in RI and I don't think you will find a better place. They are expensive, but it is a great place with great food.
June 14, 2014|Nice, but noisy|4|"Seafood selection is very good. Standard, straightforward choices for the usual New England fish/shellfish, meat for non-fish eaters, and chef's ""specialties"" including paella and a few shellfish-pasta dishes. Portions are generous. Salad was fresh, but not exciting. We shared the sesame seared tuna with wasabi and coconut curried mussels as appetizers. Both were very good. The mussels are served with grilled baguette, but despite a large bowl of mussels, there was only one small slice of baguette for dipping in the sauce. The paella was good, but not outstanding. It included some swordfish which was very moist yet cooked through. We shared a 3-part creme brulee dessert, chocolate, Earl Grey, vanilla. Delicious. Would go again."
June 14, 2014|Ourstanding as always|5|We usually plan to attend Hemenway's prior to Water Fire evenings. It's always a great start to a wonderful night. The Papasquash Oysters are superb and our waiter, Bill, aims to please. Thumbs up for all four of us!
June 14, 2014|Off the hook seafood !!!|5|I took my wife out for a night in Providence to enjoy the waterfire event and was fortunate enough to choose Hemenways as our sunset dining place. The location is right off the waterpark trail and the seafood from appetizer to entree was absolutely OFF THE HOOK DELICIOUS ! It was my wife's first time there, not mine, and Hemenways is our 1st choice on a return visit.
June 14, 2014|Awful service. My wife's food (pork dish...|1|Awful service. My wife's food (pork dish) was a combination of hard and dry and raw....I suspect it was a frozen piece. Our friend's food was lukewarm. Never refilled our water glasses.
June 14, 2014|Amazing Experience|5|Our party of 4 was extremely pleased and satisfied with our entire dining experience. Amazing food, very attentive & professional service. It was worth every penny spent. We will be sure to visit again
June 13, 2014|great for waterfire|4|staff very friendly, good recommendations, great location overlooking river.
June 9, 2014|This was our fourth visit|5|to Hemenways and there will definetely be a fifth visit in our future. Monday is half price raw bar and the cherry stones were delicious.
June 7, 2014|Another great dinner with the best servi...|5|Another great dinner with the best service around.
June 7, 2014|fantastic rolls|4|Sometimes you can glimpse the overall quality of a restaurant by very simples things that are served as complimentary. The rolls were perfect: warm and moist on the inside nested under golden delightful crust that melts in the mouth with sweet honey butter. The rest of the food, including buttery lobster/crab cake, just felt right. A good place to have dinner with friends and share a good time in the Ocean State.
June 7, 2014|Dinner and theater|5|Dinner was delicious! We were running late due to traffic but they kept my reservation. Our waitress was lovely, asked about theater plans and made sure we were served and had plenty of time to enjoy our dinner. We all had seafood and all agreed it was a great meal!
June 7, 2014|Fabulous dining experience.|5|One of the best evenings in a long time. Food was wonderful, our waiter was very attentive and helpful.
June 7, 2014|Lovely food and service.|5|I was there for a conference at the Biltmore - and went searching for the best seafood within walking distance. Hemenway's fit the bill. I went for two meals - one lunch and one dinner. Both were excellent. The lobster bisque is to die for.
June 4, 2014|Great business dinner|5|Took out of town colleague out for dinner, he likes seafood. Excellent service and food. He came away very impressed. I tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Very tasty and excellent presentation. Great job!
June 3, 2014|Constantly Excellent|4|Back in town on business and came to Hemenways. As always, very attentive service with excellent food. I had the seafood casserole which was filled with large chunks of lobster and shrimp and cooked to perfection. My associate had the scallops which were large and very flavorful. This place is the epitome of consistency with always a good meal even if it has been two years!
June 3, 2014|Old school in a good way|5|Great seafood with a traditional, old-school dining experience. Great windows with park views.
May 30, 2014|A Gem|5|This was a nice surprise. The food was excellent. I have a rare allergy and they were ver accommodating with my food, allowing me to order something not on their normal menu. The meal was fantastic. Our waitress, Diane helped to make the night special. She was outstanding.
May 30, 2014|great place to go|5|i take my mom here for lunch for mothers day every year and we love it hemenways has always been one of my favorite places to eat at always very good
Dined on May 29, 2014|Birthday celebration!|5|Actually went to hemenways with my boyfriend for my birthday celebration! The food was delicious as it is everytime! I've never been disappointment with the food or service here! Definitely a wonderful place for a special occasion!
May 28, 2014|They did an excellent job for out annive...|5|They did an excellent job for out anniversary dinner. Food was very good/fresh. We would highly recremend to friends and family.
May 28, 2014|Weds 5/28|5|I had the opportunity to introduce a business friend to Hemmenway's and he felt the same way I did the first time I ate there. Great food, ambiance & service. The Poppasquash oysters were an amazing beginning to a great meal. Next visit will be with my wife.
May 27, 2014|Great Anniversary dinner|5|Celebrating our Anniversary with family after making some last minute reservations and the staff made it very special. Food was all great and service was exceptional. One member of our party had a steak cooked not quite as ordered and the staff immediately corrected it with a new steak. Met all our expectations.
May 24, 2014|terrific fish and fresh seafood|5|our whole family was together for graduation and the food was all outstanding. the lobster bisque had large chunks of lobster in it. The service was wonderful the waitress was very attentive.
May 23, 2014|Excellent|5|Great overall experience, from the oysters before, to drink selections, to entrees, to wait staff
May 23, 2014|Always a delightful experience|5|With top notch food and service, we always have a relaxing and enjoyable experience.
May 22, 2014|Everything was very good as usual at thi...|4|Everything was very good as usual at this restaurant, however, in the past when you would be celebrating a special occasion they would give you a free dessert. Well, we were celebrating our anniversary and noticed that they did not do that this time. Little disappoionting for a restaurant of this caliber.
May 21, 2014|Pre-concert dinner|3|Four of us dined prior to going to a Botti concert. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. Appetizer of calamari was excellent. When entrees arrived the waiter had mistakenly placed and order for scallops instead of seafood pasta so there was a slight wait for preparation of the correct dish. The paella had no semblance to the original dish. Rice was soggy and had no flavor. Seafood and chourico were good. Skip the paella. Salmon was good and seafood pasta good.
May 21, 2014|Great Seafood Dinning|5|Great downtown location on the river and walkway, with large windows, making it feel like you are dinning outdoors. The seafood was excellent and prepared as we requested. Our waitress, Nancy, was very attentive, and made it a special evening.
May 18, 2014|Best dining experience in R.I.|5|We dined here on a very busy graduation week-end. We had reservations and were seated promptly at a wonderful table by the window. The server (Dan?) was fabulous. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the RI area. He was friendly and attentive but not hovering. I give him an A++++. We ordered a few appetizers, drinks, wine and dinner. Everything came when we expected it to; no lulls in our dinner. All three of our meals were spectacular. the atmosphere was special occasion but very, very comfortable. We had dinner at an upscale steakhouse the night before and enjoyed ourselves, but Hemenway's was far superior for service, food and atmosphere (and less expensive). When in R.I., Hemenway's will be my #1 choice every time.
May 18, 2014|Birthday Celebration|5|My family had a phenomenal birthday lunch! Danny was the best and most accommodating waiter ever! Very knowledgable and attentive. Perfect meal and everything was delicious!
May 17, 2014|We Will Be Back!|3|We selected Hemenway's for a college graduation congratulatory dinner based on feedback from locals. We were all hungry after a long day. The staff was welcoming and attentive, without hovering. The food was perfectly prepared and everyone enjoyed their meal whether it was a steak or seafood - even the professional chef in our party was pleased. The locals were right and we will be back!
May 17, 2014|Great experience|5|A wonderful Sunday night dinner with my adult children, it was busy with some large groups with the various University graduation taking place this weekend. The service was excellent the food delicious the Filet Mignon melts in your mouth the food was plentiful. The parking is great and they validate. Should go bck more often.
May 15, 2014|Fine dining on the fly|5|In from Boston for a show at 8. Reservation for 630, arrived @ 620 after hunting for parking. Seated promptly by the window with a view of the river and gondolas. Nice room. Asked server Annie about being dine by 730 and she saud she'd do her best. Started eith calamari app. Get it!! Bread had just gine in the oven so a beat slow but worth the wait. My wife had a caesar salad and seared yellowfin tuna. I had a seafood caesar salad loaded with lobster, crad and some jumbo shrimp. Excellent. Skipped dessert and we were out at 725. Excellent ambience, food and service. Price point as expected and right fot the spot. We'll leave more time next time.
May 14, 2014|Great Lobster Dinner|4|Lobster dinner (Heminway's and Mac&Cheese) are good plates and would order the same on next visit.
May 14, 2014|Mixed|3|The best part of the restaurant is the staff. All friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is fun and lively and our waiter was fantastic. The appetizers (scallops, crab cakes) were delicious. The one down side to the experience was one of the entrees. The waiter described the swordfish as freshly caught off the local shores. He continued to say that the serving would be thick and therefore stay moist and juicy when cooked. Unfortunately, the piece of fish was thin and dry. The rest of the night, however, was good enough to entice us back to the restaurant.
May 11, 2014|Outstanding|5|Always great to visit Hemenways. The food is always fantastic and the service is just right!
May 11, 2014|Absolutely Outstanding|5|Celebrated Mother 's Day with my wife and mother-in-law and the food was great as my mother-in-law had her usual baked stuffed shrimp and my wife and I both had for the first time in ages the baked stuffed lobster 2 pounders. The service from Maura and Danny was superb and we had to have been approached by at least three different managers if we were satisfied. Great meal, great service, great place. Too bad we can't afford to go more often.
May 10, 2014|Horrendous service|1|My son and I took my mom for an early Mother's Day dinner Saturday night. We were promptly seated and then didn't even see a server to order drinks for 15 minutes. Finally ordered and before the adult meals came a runner literally flung my sons meal (and the wrong meal at that) at the end of our table. The server was nowhere to be found for most of the night. The manager did come over and offered to comp our drinks (and ended up only comping a small portion) but it doesn't make up for the overall bad experience. I would never dine here again, not with all the excellent other choices we have in providence.
May 10, 2014|Consistently commendable|4|We enjoyed a great early dinner following the theater. Good choices of fresh fish prepared with a flair. Attentive service. Prices on the high side but value is there.
May 9, 2014|wonderful as always! |5|Always great food, service and atmosphere! We eat here often and recommend it to locals as well as visitors. To Providence!
May 9, 2014|Consistent Quality|5|Always a good choice. High quality food and service. Some of the best seafood in town.
May 9, 2014|WONDERFUL|4|It was a great experience! I took my fiance for his birthday, and he enjoyed it. The ambiance was romantic, and it was the perfect scene for us! I would definitely recommend this to any couple!!
May 5, 2014|Quality|5|A wonderful place to have a quality dinner. Terrific seafood and truly amazing dessert. Wine selection was easy due to the variety. The key lime pie with a vanilla sauce was the best I've ever tasted. Highly recommend for those who only want the best!
May 4, 2014|Lovely dinner|5|We had a wonderful dinner here. We shared the bacon wrapped scallops which was plenty to share and were very good. I had the Seafood Caesar salad as a main dish. It was outstanding and plenty for a main dish, the dressing was great and not over bearing to the seafood. My husband had the fried scrod and said it was very good, but not wonderful. My daughter had the Lobster Mac N Cheese and she absolutely loved it! The lobster was huge and stuffed with the mac n cheese. There was no room for dessert. The setting is lovely and our server was great. We went on a Sunday and all bottled wine is half price, nice!
May 3, 2014|Great place for special event|4|My wife and I enjoyed our 25th anniversary dinner at Hemenway's. Our overall experience was very good. As part of the reservation, I told them it was an anniversary dinner and requested a table by the window. The obliged with the table as requested and seated us promptly at 7:45 (maybe a few minutes early). To start we enjoyed the calamari and oysters. I've had oysters here before and they do not disappoint; excellent. I had the yellow fin tube and my wife had the stuffed lobster; both very good. I capped of the evening with key lime pie and an espresso. Both yummy. Service was good; perfect pace allowing us to enjoy our meals, chat and drinks. Although I've been to Hemenway's before, this is my first review. Would definitely go back here.
May 3, 2014|Best restaurant all around|5|We love coming to Hemenways. We've chosen Hemenway's for many occasions; anniversaries, new years eve, celebratory dinner with friends...even just a low key dinner for some good food. The server is always very friendly and knowledgeable. We LOVE the raw bar selection and have never had an entree to disappoint. Great food, great atmosphere, great staff...all around an awesome restaurant.
May 3, 2014|Dining delight|5|This was an outstanding find and the highlight of the trip to Providence. I highly recommend the calamari and sesame crusted tuna salad. Service was exemplary and the online reservation was easy to complete. I would definitely return.
May 2, 2014|great|4|The food was great if just a bit predictable in style and plating. they did try to differentiate themselves with their seared scallops by marinating in beat juice but the change was minor and taste-wise almost undetectable. On a less mean note the food was cooked very well I especially liked the calamari which was the most tender calamari I have ever had. All the food was plated beautifully and seasoned well. The meal was great, my only other minor complaint would be that the waitress forgot a drink order but I don't blame her for that on a Friday night.
April 30, 2014|Good... Not great!|4|"I so wanted to love this place... However, like is good too. Food was good but wanted ""great"". Great wine selection. Host was very nice and friendly. Parking was a little confusing, at first."
April 28, 2014|Never disappoints|5|Every time I dine at Hemenway's, I'm always delighted at the predictability and consistency of the food and service. I am never disappointed.
April 26, 2014|Great Food |5|Had a Little issue with one of the waitress she was either to busy or didn't like us.
April 26, 2014|Very pleased|4|I went to Rhode Island to visit J &W University. Hemenway s was recommended to me by a friend. He was right. The food was great. The Location was convenient. The waitress Annie was super friendly and service was great.
April 26, 2014|Delicious!|5|Fabulous food and reasonable wine list. We had an amazing meal of swordfish, scallops, and oysters. Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. The wine list was great; extensive choises and very reasonable prices. We will definetly be going here again!
April 25, 2014|As always, Hemenway's was terrific|5|Here was the run down: cocktail shrimp were perfect, big and cold, firm with nice cocktail sauce; lobster bisque with the largest piece of lobster ever seen in a bisque; house dressing rocks as it has for 27+ years; swordfish excellent and paella even more impressive. Thanks Morgan!
April 25, 2014|Romantic dinner|5|We went for our 27 anniversary and it was a great experience all around! The table had rose petals on it and we got complimentary dessert. The entire staff treated us special because they new it was our anniversary, our waitress Annie was fantastic ! The food as always was great! Highly recommend ! My favorite seafood restaurant in I providence !
April 25, 2014|Great Find...|5|My family was in town for a youth soccer game, I looked up seafood restaurants in providence and came across Hemenways. The food was delicious, perfect portion size and the service was outstanding. Next time back to providence we will be visiting Hemenways again!
April 25, 2014|Date night|5|Had a great dinner, hadn't been there in a couple of years, but its still a classic. I would recommend it to anyone!!
April 19, 2014|My husband and I heard a lot of great th...|4|My husband and I heard a lot of great things about this restaurant and decided to give it a try. The food and service were amazing. The only thing I will do next time is try to get a table on the side or a booth with more room. My husband is not a small guy and we were stuck at a table in the middle.
Dined on April 19, 2014|Another Amazing Dinner|5|We had dinner at Hemenway's the night we eloped, 28 years ago and have been returning for anniversary's, birthdays, graduations and sometimes just a good meal ever since. Not once in all these years have any of us had a bad meal or anything short of outstanding experience. Every time we go we think we have the best server, yet the next time, we have another server who is just as amazing! I hope to be able to celebrate 28 more anniversary's with Hemenways!
April 19, 2014|Wait staff|4|Our waiter, Diane, was excellent, and considerate.
April 17, 2014|Consistently excellent|5|We always have a special time. The food and staff are consistently top notch.
April 13, 2014|Great as usual|4|We have dined here countless times since it opened many years ago. We have never been disappointed, including when we brought 50 of our closest loved ones for a very special event. Dan K our waiter was as good as it gets, and assures a return visit.
April 12, 2014|Delicious|5|It was my first time and it definitely won't be my last. Great wine selection, fresh oysters from a multitude of locations, and phenomenal service make for a great dining selection.
April 11, 2014|Clams with sand|5|Very disappointed that my clam dinner was full of sand and a few bits of clamshell. Never expected that from this quality restaurant which we go to often.
April 9, 2014|I enjoyed the restaurant very|4|I enjoyed the restaurant very much with my guest from Chicago. The service and food was excellent. Minor note; I was very cramped in my seat as the table behind us had no room to move their chairs as we were directly touching when i sat down - little uncomfortable. Thank you
April 6, 2014|Fresh Seafood!|5|I love Hemenway's because I love to go out for dinner and eat healthy. The raw bar is fantastic, the fish is fresh, and the restaurant is extremely accommodating. If you don't like seafood, you may want to choose a different restaurant. If you love fish, I think this is the best in Providence! Have never had a bad meal or experience here. Service is outstanding and food is as well.
April 5, 2014|Not as good as anticipated|3|I used to go here often but had not been for quite a while and was looking forward to it. I was a little disappointed. The place itself was very nice. The appetizers were great. The mixed drink I ordered is very standard but was not made correctly. It was done over and was correct. My meal was not prepared as ordered. I sent it back and it was OK. The other two people with me had better luck. There meal was fine. The waiter was fair to good. Not what you'd expect in this type of place. I would get it another try. Maybe it was an off night.
April 5, 2014|where's the fish?|3|For a restaurant touting its fish, the selection was very limited. Scallops appetizer was delicious, but swordfish entree for my tastes was somewhat overdone. Disappointing that there were no special treatments. We are used to the culinary creativity of Boston.
April 4, 2014|Best Seafood in the City|5|If you are looking for a great seafood restaurant in providence, you won't find any better. I got the special, which was fresh fluke and it was amazing. Someone else got the lobster mac and cheese and it was not only amazing, but it was served in the 2 lb lobster which was mixed in the mac and cheese. Overall, great meal, nice place and friendly people.
April 4, 2014|Birthday dinning|5|Great experience from start to finish; Including the food, service, and ambiance. A Must try beverage is, the Hibiscus Belini cocktail! They had two waiting for us at our table upon our arrival, just as I requested through opentable. To our surprise and pleasure, the waiter brought over a slice of cake for my boyfiends's birthday, without even requesting one. Would highly recommend for seafood lovers especially!
March 30, 2014|We love Hemenways, it is our|5|We love Hemenways, it is our favorite restaurant as a family and to bring people to. it was an extreme pleasure to be able to eat and feel secure , being celiac, that the food was treated and served as it needed to be. Thank you for making this a priority. The entire staff are pleasant and desire to make your visit as special as it can be. Thank You
March 29, 2014|Great Place for Dinner|5|My wife and had a great time. The service was outstanding everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed. The food was amazing, I had the steak and my wife had the lobster. A+.
March 29, 2014|It's a seafood delight!|5|Hemenway's is our place to take guests for wonderful seafood.
March 25, 2014|Bring back the mousse|4|Great food and ambience. Desserts uninspired. Bring back the white chocolate mousse.
March 23, 2014|Hemenway's a Home Run|5|In a word....fabulous! Food, service, atmosphere five star all the way.
March 22, 2014|Wonderful Birthday|5|Our entire experience was wonderful. From the minute we were seated the staff was very attentive. Food was excellent and service top notch. Our waitress was fantastic. We decided to have after dinner drinks at the bar and she went over a saved 2 seats for us. we go out to eat weekly and our night at Hemenway's takes the top prize.
March 22, 2014|Happy Birthday!|5|We had an excellent time. We were celebrating a 50th birthday and the staff was wonderful! The food was great! They even coordinated a gift bottle of wine from out of state siblings. Definitely a class act! I will definitely be returning in the future! Thanks for a wonderful night!
March 21, 2014|One of the best dining experiences!|5|Chicago-based, there's lots of great restaurants to choose from...and traveling the country, I've eaten all over, but Hemenway's has definitely made my top 3 of 'best restaurant experiences'. From the food to the service, everything was impeccable. Having a shellfish allergy, they made sure from the way the scallops were cooked to the executive chef bringing out my fish for dinner, that everything was perfect...and sure it was. Fantabulous bread, apps, fish, sides, dessert, port, and of course the fume blanc that complimented everything. Our server was extremely attentive, beyond helpful, pleasant and genuinely interested that we have a great dinner. I visit Providence once/yr and wish it was more often so I can dine here more!
March 20, 2014|Never disappointed/always delighted|5|We love dining at Hemenway's. It's always a delightful experience.
March 17, 2014|Aways a special treat for our special ev...|5|Aways a special treat for our special events. We continue to patronize Hemenway's because it is the best restaurant in Providence.
March 16, 2014|Four friends had dinner to|5|Four friends had dinner to celebrate an anniversary. Service was wonderful and the food was great. The 1/2 off wine special on Sunday night was a fantastic surprise. Whenever we have a special event and we're thinking seafood - we head to Hemingways. We've never been disappointed.
March 16, 2014|Excellent experience|5|The food was amazing. Each dish was cooked perfectly. We did have to send back one dish. It was a veal chop. However, the server and manager took care of us well. They asked no questions and brought an appetizer and another meal very promptly. The new meal and app were fantastic as was everything else. All seafood was cooked to perfection and delivered by smiling servers. We will certainly go back.
March 15, 2014|Taken for granted gem!|4|Hemenway's has been around for so long and has been so consistently fine that it is easy to overlook how good a restaurant it is...particularly in the midst of the vibrant food scene in Providence. Our party had scallops, paella, fried clams, and a veal chop. All we're perfectly prepared, and beautifully presented, including the fried clams. Hemenway's definitely tilts to the high end in terms of cost, but the food quality, the service, and the overall ambience make it a regular in our restaurant rotation. Recommend you go...,
March 14, 2014|I worked at a seafood restaurant|5|I worked at a seafood restaurant for 7 years. Hemenway's food was very fresh and great quality. We sampled a little of everything from the seafood restaurant, and I can't find a complaint about a single thing. The drinks were strong, the service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant. There is even free parking the parking garage just under Hemenway's (free if you stay less than 3 hours). My only regret is that I didn't visit Hemenway's sooner! I highly recommend Hemenway's!
March 14, 2014|Always a pleasure|5|Hemenway's has been around a long time, and that means they are consistent and well deserved! I've had groups of 40 to a pair, and each event has been perfect.
March 11, 2014|Dinner with a friend|4|Met a long time friend for dinner. Arrived a bit late but no problem with the reservation. High table with a terrific view of the river walk. Good selection of wine by the glass (my friend does not drink) and excellent food. Great service, attentive but not intrusive.
March 8, 2014|Strongly recommended|5|I had gone to Legal seafood the weekend before. 360 degree difference. I haven't one bad thing to say about Hemingway's. The Rhode Island wild oysters were the best I've ever had. We were seated quickly. Staff was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere nice. I strongly recommend this place for dinner!
March 8, 2014|Enjoyable Evening|5|I have dined at Hemenway's a number of times and have never been disappointed. The service is always fantastic, the food is consistently good and the wine list is fairly priced. Highly recommended to anyone wanting a pleasurable dining experience.
March 2, 2014|Half off entire wine menu on Sunday|5|We visit Hemenways a lot the food is always great and the service the same. Steve was our waiter this visit he was fun and very knowledgeable of the specials of the night.The restaurant was not busy as it was a Sunday night. Big plus is every Sunday half price on their entire wine menu. This is a great way to try some top end wines
March 1, 2014|Just what we wanted|5|We were looking for a restaurant midway between our home in MA and our friend's in CT. We decided on Providence and scoured the internet to find a seafood place that looked good. What a good decision! Our waiter was attentive and not at all pushy when we had to wait for our friends and then spent a half hour catching up before ordering. He made great suggestions and was there whenever we needed him throughout the meal (another drink, a question, ready for dessert). The food - oh so good. We ordered the swordfish special, the salmon, shrimp scampi and on our waiter's suggestion the seafood casserole and not one of us was disappointed. Dessert was shared warm tart and heavenly cheesecake. We will make the trip again for Hemenway's!
February 28, 2014|Good Seafood & More|4|Had a wonderful dinner before PPAC. No waiting, service was excellent & food was prepared to our liking.
February 27, 2014|Very Disappointed|3|We have been dining here for 10+ years and always pleasure able. This evening was my daughters 19th birthday celebration I had reserved a table by the window 2 days prior. When we arrived we were seated by a miserably rude host. He took us to a table in the bar area. When I told him I had asked for a window table he told me that all window tables had already been taken. I pointed out that I had reserved a table two days prior due to this special occasion. He replied with there are non available, when in fact there wer two able empty! To make matters worse we were seated at a table more comfortable for TWO NOT FOUR! We were all squished in! He never even apologized! Not sure I'll return.
February 23, 2014|Superior Service|5|After 20 years of dining with my husband in some great restaurants, Hemenway's service was among the top 3, if not the best we've had. Not only our server, Diane, but any server we encountered or overheard at the table behind ours. Great food as well, but I'd go back just for the service at this restaurant.
February 22, 2014|Great service|5|Our waitress was outstanding! The only reason for a lesser rating on food was due to the mussels. I was very disappointed. They were way undercooked and half of them weren't open. Our main dish was great though!
February 22, 2014|Excellent Food & Service|5|"My wife & I were tired of eating the same old ""pub food"" that is served in our usual last minute restaurants. I used my OpenTable app to see where I could get a reservation for 3 on the last minute on a Saturday evening. My wife was in the mood for seafood and luckily Hemenways had a table available. I used the app to make the reservation and we headed to the restaurant. We were seated as soon as we arrived. It was a typically busy Saturday evening. We were seated in a booth. My only complaint is that the booth was rather tight, as my son& I are on the husky side. The service and the food was excellent. Hemenways remains on of our favorite restaurants."
February 22, 2014|my wife and I had a terrific|5|my wife and I had a terrific time, we really thought our server was so nice, and another staff member took a nice picture of us there too. Hems is our favorite nice restaurant in Providence, we usually eat there a few times a year. We feel you get the greatest steaks, filet, and seafood of coarse. Thanks to our server, I wish I remembered her name, she was awesome.
February 22, 2014|Special Lunch at Hemenway's|5|My family had a lovely Saturday lunch at Hemenway's for my daughter's 25th birthday. She was able to have a gluten-free meal which she thoroughly enjoyed, and the rest of us all had wonderful seafood meals also. The staff was very welcoming and we had the pleasure of being served by Jason who was truly professional and very kind. One of the best moments was when he brought a piece of delicious flourless chocolate cake, with lit candle and all...as a total surprise to all of us. Thank you all at at Hemenway's for making her 25th a very happy occasion!!
February 21, 2014|Great food!|5|The seafood was outstanding ! Great service ? I am definitely going back!
Dined on February 21, 2014|Birthday Celebration|5|We hosted several friends for a special birthday dinner and were once again very pleased with the attentive service of our wait staff, the excellent quality of our meals, and we all enjoyed the drinks and wine selections. Hemenway's is a special occasion place for us and we will look forward to our next visit.
February 20, 2014|parking was easy, complimentary|4|parking was easy, complimentary free valet ... service excellent, server very knowledgeable. Food was good.
February 16, 2014|server Dan|5|Loved it celebrated our 45th anniversary at your wonderful establishment.
February 15, 2014|Seafood Gem|5|Whenever we are in providence, this us a favorite!!
February 15, 2014|Great Everytime!!|5|We found ourselves in the fortunate position of no kids at home so we headed out to a favorite restaurant. Our table was ready right on time. The wine selection was great and I highly recommend the Stoli Dolie martini. The lobster and crab cakes were the best I've ever had. We each ordered one of that evenings specials. My veal chop oscar style was fantastic. Finished with a great piece of cheese cake. Thanks to Annie our server, it was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I'd tell you more but I'm hungry now so I'm heading back to Hemenways!
February 14, 2014|Best Seafood Restaurant in RI|5|I have been to Hemenways many times, and have always had nothing but stellar service and food. The food quality is consistent, the staff is accommodating and informative, and the atmosphere is hip and romantic. Honestly, it's in my girlfriend and I's top 3 favorite restaurants. GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE!!! If you are looking for amazing service and food, and don't care about how much your spending on dinner then I highly recommend this place
February 14, 2014|value not there|3|Food was just okay for a restaurant that specializes in fish. Just not as fresh as we have come to expect in new England. Service was excellent.
February 14, 2014|Valentine's tradition|5|"My girlfriend and I have made this ""our"" restaurant and we go whenever we can. We always have plans for Valentine's Day and they never disappoint us! This is one of the finest restaurants in Providence!"

February 14, 2014|Slow down|3|Great food. But we felt extremely rushed. So rushed that we left the Resterant and went somewhere else for expresso martini and dessert, coffee. None of the other Newport harbor Resterants do that. We will not be returning.
February 12, 2014|Awesome restaurant|5|We eat at Hemenway's often and have never been disappointed. The food is consistently excellent, and the service is fantastic!
February 12, 2014|great experience, friendly|5|great experience, friendly staff the place to go before PPAC
February 10, 2014|ANNIVERSARY DINNER|5|We went for our anniversary....they covered our table in rose petals and offered us desert or a champagne toast on them! The Filet Mignon was excellent as was the potato casserole that was served with it. My husband had the lobster mac and cheese which had the meat of an entire lobster! Terrific shrimp cocktail...hugh and well chilled and baked oysters were perfect!
February 10, 2014|Hemenway's, The Sinking Ship|3|I have been a big fan of Hemenway's for many years. I have gone there often for special occasions, but mostly to entertain out of town customers. The quality, quantity, and presentation of the food has really dropped, and is no longer commensurate with plate prices. Plenty of better alternatives these days.
February 9, 2014|All you could want|5|Reliably excellent food and service with a nice view on the river.
February 8, 2014|Excellent Food, Drinks, & Service!|5|Service was unbelieveable, fast, extremely friendly, smart and on point! Made excellent recommendations, specials sounded amazing. We will def be back soon!
February 1, 2014|Delightful|5|Hemenway's just gets better and better. Our dinner on Saturday evening was delicious and the service was perfect.
February 1, 2014|Excellent!|5|Absolutely loved everything about this restaurant. It was classy without being snobby, had amazing food, and excellent serivce! My boyfriend and I dined here this last weekend and we both had an amazing time. I'd definitely recommended Hemenway's!
February 1, 2014|Fabulous Experience|4|My boyfriend and I were celebrating an early Valentines, his birthday, and our 3 year anniversary. We were placed in a very nice romantic spot, where it was quiet and quite pleasing. Our waitress made all the difference. The place itself was very nice and welcoming, but our server, Ellie was especially sweet and so kind, and the service was very fast. The food came out in a very fashionable manner, everything was just right! The towels to wipe our hands after a delicious lobster dinner was a pleasant surprise. We had a great time, and cannot wait to be back. I have already spread the word to many how terrific our experience had been. Thank you Hemenway's for a great night!
February 1, 2014|Seafood!|4|Great place for an afternoon or evening meal. Excellent raw bar.
January 31, 2014|Just Average|3|The food was average, with no uniqueness or anything out of the ordinary. At the menu price points, one can find uniqueness elsewhere in the area (e.g. Farmstead and Chez). Had the Seafood Paella, which was bland in flavor. Lacked a good amount of seasoning. Also sampled the Shrimp Scampi, which turned out to be an average pasta dish. The Shrimp Scampi had dependable and expected flavor profile.
January 31, 2014|Great steak|5|I had the filet and my wife had the sole. Both were outstanding, we will definitely be back again!
January 29, 2014|Annie is a great server!|5|We love coming to Hemenways. Annie was our server for the second time and she did a great job keeping our courses coming smoothly and efficiently and kept our glasses full so we could make it to our show in time.
January 29, 2014|Never Miss|5|I've been going here since it opened and have never been disappointed. Never met a less-than professional server; never had to send anything back; never had less than a memorable experience. I guess that's why we still come back.
January 25, 2014|Great 360 Degrees|5|It was a wonderful dining experience from the time we set foot in to the time we set foot out!! Will be back.
January 21, 2014|It was a snowy night so relatively|4|It was a snowy night so relatively quiet at the restaurant but the service was great as well as the food; had to get to the PC game so our waitress, Louise, did a nice job getting our order and food out right away; the lobster bisque was awesome; yellow fin tuna salad was perfect as well. Ambience is really nice; nice place for any occasion.
January 19, 2014|Awesome Restaurant|5|We celebrated my neice's birthday at Hemenways. The restaurant is beautiful inside with a great view of the city. Our waitress, Hollie was excellent! She explained the menu and brought a gluten free menu for my daughter in law. She even brought gluten free rolls to her. The food was delicious. There was a large party near us, but the restaurant wasn't noisy at all. I was happy to use my restaurant points since Hemenways belongs to The Newport Restaurant Group. I will definitely visit again. They have been in business for a very long time (25 yrs+) and it's obvious why. Thank you.
January 19, 2014|Great Experience|5|From the moment I walked in the door the staff made me feel special! This was my second visit and the service, food and cocktails were wonderful. My lunch was oysters on the half shell and the Ceaser salad had plenty of fresh seafood. The salad was crisp and the dressing was tasty but not overwhelming. We were seated by the window overlooking the canal which was very pleasant. I drive from Cape Cod to meet friends at this restaurant and find it to be well worth the 60+ mile trip!
January 18, 2014|We always love coming to Hemenway's|4|We always love coming to Hemenway's. This was another great dinner. It was restaurant week (which we didn't realize), so it was crazy. We had later reservations for the dining room, but we tried to dine at the bar which is always our preference. Cody was outstanding. I have experienced his service a few times in the past and he is always on top of his game. Saturday was a huge success primarily because of him. He went out of his way to keep us occupied with drinks and snacks until we could get to the bar. Very professional, very engaging, and a lot of fun to interact with. He made the crazy crowd seem less painful. Take good care of him!
January 18, 2014|Restaurant Week|5|We like to go during restaurant week because it is such a great deal. Otherwise, we usually save it for special occasions.
January 15, 2014|cant wait to return|5|I went to Hemenways with a friend from Boston for Restaurant Week.The Service was fantastic and the food was so delicious that i cant wait to go back.
January 14, 2014|Hemenways did a GREAT job|5|Hemenways did a GREAT job from the moment we arrived till we left the door!! VERY impressed with the hostess, lady in coats, manager and our wonderful waiter, Cory! Food was EXCELLENT and we were NOT rushed!
January 12, 2014|Wonderful!|5|Best of the 4 restaurants we went to during Providence Restaurant week - can't wait to go back
January 12, 2014|Perfect!|5|Excellent food, excellent service. Perfect dinner after a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center.
January 12, 2014|As Good As It Gets|5|"If I could fix on one thing that was not worthy of FIVE STARS...I would...but I can't! You have a remarkable restaurant. Thanks for being where you are, in ""Providence."" Continue to be, what you are - an extraordinary place to eat...providing an unforgetable dining experience."
January 11, 2014|Excellent Food|4|The food and service were excellent. I felt very taken care of. The view is gorgeous, too. Very romantic. The drink menu is lacking though.
January 11, 2014|restaurant week|4|Tried during restaurant week. Had the specials and were happy we did. Both fish dishes were very good. You always need one of their famous Stollie Dollies when you go. Yum but remember to limit yourself.
January 11, 2014|chewy|3|steak was chewy, and shrimp was somewhat spicy which menu did not indicate. clams in linguine with clams were ok, but some very chewy. the meal itself was bland.
January 11, 2014|fantastic|5|Best meal I've had in a while! Plus you enbraced restaurant week. While other restaurants make you ask for the menu then only give you one menu we were automatically shown the special. I can't wait to go back on a regular day. Thank you for the wonderful food experience.
January 11, 2014|Mediocrity|3|"We went for lunch on Saturday during restaurant week. After reading outstanding reviews we were left somewhat disappointed. It wasn't that anything was ""bad"", it just was barely ""good"". Our server was excellent. The little maitre'd guy was overenthusiastic, unexperienced, and frankly a little bit annoying. Starters were fine but nothing special. Presentation was dull. Main courses, one was decent, with nice roasted seasonal vegetables. The second was greasy and flavorless, but not terrible. Dessert: one was yummy, the other did not taste fresh, and would have been better had it been warm, the cranberry sorbet it was served with was very good however. Disappointing considering they supposedly pride themselves on their seafood."
Dined on January 10, 2014|Special Treatment is worth noting|4|I made reservations over the phone for my 50th birthday. We sat in a window seat overlooking the Providence skyline. Bill, our waiter, who has been employed at Hemingways for the past 24 years, is no doubt the best waiter in RI. Attending to all your needs without even asking him to do so and eager to make suggestions as well. I have dietary restrictions (gluten/dairy free) . There was an gluten free menu for me, and kodos to Chef Lee for providing a gluten/dairy free dessert for my special 50th birthday. I placed my request for a special dessert on my reservations and not only did Chef Lee make a delicious speciality, he served it to me and then returned to the table to see if I liked his creation. Hemingways is consistently wonderful.
January 9, 2014|Birthday dinner|4|We did this for a friend's bday during restaurant week. We stuck to the menu but had drinks and oysters too. Great service and the food was amazing. Even for the discounted rate the portions were large. Would definitely go back.
January 9, 2014|Consistently Excellent|5|Every visit is a special occasion -- food and service are always top notch and specials are always worth trying.
January 8, 2014|Class|5|"Hemmenways gets it. Food is excellent. Service was great. Atmosphere finds an excellent balance of classy but not pretentious. ""Additional Information"" provided through open table when booking had been relayed and acknowledged by each of the members of staff we interacted with. One of our favorite restaurants!"
January 7, 2014|Excellent Restaurant Week Treat!|4|I've been to Hemenways for Restaurant Week before, and they do not disappoint. The lobster chowder is - as always - excellent, very creamy with a few chunks of lobster in it. Skip the crackers; there's enough salt in the chowder that they add a little too much to the cup/bowl. The grilled salmon with miso was just wonderful, and the grilled artichokes go very nicely, making a dish that's not too heavy. I finished my meal off with the flour less chocolate torte, which is supremely tasty and very decadent. We had a group, and everybody loved their meals, even without sampling the house specialty - oysters. Definitely recommend for groups, and I would think it would make a great romantic dinner for seafood lovers!
January 6, 2014|I had the Restaurant week|3|I had the Restaurant week special, the main course was a seafood Medley. The Seafood was overcooked and dry!!!
January 4, 2014|A Providence Tradition|4|"Since Ned Grace created it, Hemenway's has (with only a short time where it fell off the rails a bit) always been a Rhode Island culinary landmark. One of the first daily fresh fish restaurants in the region, the menus hasn't strayed too far from its roots. The new menus brings forward a little more chef-i-ness to the preparation of its signature seafood selections, but the server will tell you each time, you can have it as plain or fancy as you like. We enjoyed rare tuna and salmon prepared a few different ways. The meals were dead on and nothing was left for the doggie bag. Our server was a pro, with our neighbors extolling their seats, ""We get Annie to wait us from this table!"""
January 4, 2014|25th|4|We were in town celebrating our anniversary and chose this resturaunt simply because we enjoy seafood. We couldn't have been happier with our choice! We arived a little early and were warmly met. Easily found a seat at the bar and waited for our table. It was ready before we finished our first drink. The table was excactly as requested, Window seat with a River view and rose peddles on the table. The Server was excelent, the food was delicious (Seafood Pasta and Paella), and finished with a compementary anniversary dessert and coffee. We will go again the next time we're close.
January 4, 2014|Another Great Experience|5|This spot was super impressive the 1st time we visited. Each and every time back has been just phenomenal. Kudos to our server Brandi..Awesome food, service and ambience.. Try it.. You'll like it!
December 31, 2013|New Year's Eve dinner|4|We waited a bit for our table but we were in no rush, our server Annie was great, food was good, drinks were good. Great night out!
December 31, 2013|Went on NYE. Crowded but orderly.|5|Went on NYE. Crowded but orderly. Food and service were excellent. A great place for a special occasion.
December 31, 2013|great as usual|5|we have gone here once or twice a year for about 20 years and it's always very good or excellent.
December 31, 2013|Always great!|5|We have always had great seafood at Hemenways. They know how to prepare seafood perfectly. My husband is very particular about seafood is prepared and even at the best restaurants it can be overcooked, but not at Hemenways. The wait staff is attentive without hovering and the atmosphere is lively without being too loud and distracting.
December 30, 2013|Superb|5|Everything was top notch. From the wonderful greeting by staff to the sparkling environment and delicious food. There are no negatives at Hemenways.
December 30, 2013|We loved the lobster bisque,|4|We loved the lobster bisque, we had fish dishes and enjoyed. Finally, a key lime pie not on a chocolate graham cracker crust, to die for! The waitress was very helpful with discribing the dishes/specials and mindful of the fact we had tickets for PPAC and never made us feel rushed.
December 29, 2013|Went to Hemenways for the|5|Went to Hemenways for the Monday special on half price apps at the raw bar. Delicious food, great martinis, good company at the bar! All in all a great experience. We'll looking forward to a return soon.
December 26, 2013|Lovely for Luncheon|5|This is a wonderful restaurant for lunch on Sunday afternoon in Providence.
December 26, 2013|A Wonderful Lunch|5|I met my Aunt and cousin here for a holiday lunch. The service was attentive but not overbearing. The food was absolutely delicious. Great portions and the seafood was exceptional. It was a great way to celebrate the holidays. Cheap? No, but the quality of food, service and the gorgeous views made it more than worth the price.
December 24, 2013|We had a reservation for four|5|We had a reservation for four at 6:45 for Christmas Eve. Our party ended up being five. I spoke to the hostess on Christmas Eve and they were happy to accomodate us. The service was excellent as was the short rib!.
December 24, 2013|Great food great service|5|Very attentive to special diet requirements. Could not have been more accommodating. All food prepared perfectly and served at very polite and comfortable pace. Will be back again next Christmas Eve as we have for the past 15 years!
December 24, 2013|Outstanding seafood casserole|5|Ultimate foodie splurge on the creamy sauce with huge pieces of seafood in the seafood casserole.
December 24, 2013|Nice experience|4|Annie was our server and was very considerate and accommodating to our family including an active 2 year old. Food was very good. Appetizers and main courses did not disappoint on Christmas Eve.
December 21, 2013|Merry Christmas to us|5|Hemenways is always on our minds when we want to make sure our meal will be worth going out, and drive 45 m for. I am not making this long, I do not have to. I have never been disappointed at this restaurant; I am a pesco vegetarian , and the seafood here is a must. Everyone must dine here at least once...the view of Providence is enchanting.
December 21, 2013|Fine dining in Providence|5|One of the best restaurants I have come across. I was particularly impressed with the stuffed trout I had as my main meal and the white chocolate mousse. Nice atmosphere, excellent food, valet parking, what more can you ask for?
December 21, 2013|anniversary|5|We arrived early for reservation but were seated promptly in a spot that gave an overall view of the place. The waitress helped us select the perfect bubbly to start off the evening and was a good guide to the offerings on the menu. We got good directions at the desk for our trip back home.
December 21, 2013|Disappointed in long time favorite|3|We have been going to Hemenway's as our favorite restaurant for years, but their recent menu change has changed the character of the restaurant and now it is no longer distinctive - just one of many. It was an old reliable for good basic fish dishes and you could always count on them to serve up a fresh tasty fish of your choosing. Lately you can not get a piece of good white fish cooked to order. On my visit Saturday night - the only white fish on the menu was schrod or mahi mahi. The excuse - they only buy local - poor excuse and certainly not the case for other menu items. . Although they advertised a Branzino as the special (not local!) they were out when I ordered at 6:00 pm !!!! The trout I ordered was cooked to shoe leather.
December 20, 2013|Wonderful|4|We had Diane as a server and our evening could not have been better. We were celebrating a special occasion and it was a great place to celebrate.
December 18, 2013|Disappointing|2|Food & service were disappointing. I had high expectations because I had heard great things about this restaurant. However, our experience was a let down. The menu is sparce, portions small, $$$ high.
December 15, 2013|Great|5|We went to Providence literally for Hemenways and it did not disappoint. While the food was great, the exceptional came this time by means of our waitress who really knew her menu, was able to gauge my wife and I in terms of palette and experience.
December 15, 2013|Our server added to our dinning.|5|It was a special celebration for our family and our first time at Hemenways. We were so happy that our mention of seating preference that we requested in our reservation was considered. Just the view I had hoped for. We loved our server named Ellie, who accommodated our desire for a choice of a non-alcoholic drink. The virgin drink was not only delicious, but he price of three dollars for a tall glass of mixed juices garnished with a slice of pineapple was reasonable and appreciated. Ellie was a wealth of helpful suggestions. I especially liked the atmosphere which I found elegant, but not pretentious. We loved our dinner and hope to make a reservation again before too long.
December 14, 2013|Pre-show dinner event.|5|Excellent service and food choices. Highly recommended but a bit pricey.
December 13, 2013|All the food was fresh, served|4|All the food was fresh, served hot, service was informative and friendly!
December 13, 2013|Always Special, Never An Issue|5|We've been going here almost since it opened and it has been so consistently excellent -- they offer an excellent value as well.
December 11, 2013|So noisy! Food was okay, but|4|So noisy! Food was okay, but expected a more gourmet treatment of food and presentation. Very expensive, considering everything.
December 9, 2013|1/2 price on the wine list|5|1/2 price on the wine list on sundays and 1/2 price on the raw bar on monday..Great sea food
December 9, 2013|Never a bad meal|4|I have eaten at Hemenway's many times, and I have yet to have a bad meal. I was very disappointed that they have reduced the lunch menu and taken away many of the options that were there previously. My favourite was always the Jumbo Lump Crab salad with a fabulous Dijon vinaigrette dressing that was amazing. They are no longer serving it for lunch. The fresh fish is always great and they will cook it just about any way you would like it. The lobster bisque is wonderful. Service is usually always great, but no one is perfect!
December 7, 2013|Never ever disappoints|5|Have been coming here for years. Clearly a more expensive spot, but worth every last cent. Always my first choice
December 7, 2013|Another great meal|5|"Hemenway's is now our ""go to"" restaurant when we want great seafood. The evening was 5 star from start to finish' from the offer of a black napkin so I wouldn't get white lint on my black slacks, to the best calimari I've ever had, fabulously ,sweet bay scallops, a complimentary dessert for my son's birthday celebration. The meal was well paced and delicious. And the complimentary parking at the garage next door makes dining at hemenway's not only a delight, but hassle free."
December 5, 2013|Always dependable|4|You can always count on fresh seafood prepared with best simple and Exceptional technique. Fit for all.
December 3, 2013|Great Dining Experience|5|We enjoyed our experience tremendously. Good food, good service, great ambiance!
Dined on December 2, 2013|Excellent experience|5|My husband and I recently visited Hemenway's for our anniversary. Having made reservations prior to arrival, we were seated immediately. The service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive to our needs and surprised us with complimentary champagne when she heard it was our special day. The food was excellent. We left full and satisfied. If you want excellent tasting food and and a great dining experience I highly recommend this restaurant.
December 1, 2013|Great food and great service|5|Great food and great service with half prices bottles of wine on Sunday.
November 29, 2013|Excellent|5|Food was really good. Only glich was paells pasta undercooked but that was tended to swiftly and professionally. Waitress was outstanding. Pricey place but high quality all around. Beautiful place and location.
November 29, 2013|Ordered a 3-way combo appetizer.|4|"Ordered a 3-way combo appetizer. Asked server to replace fried calamari for steamers. Answer should have been: ""for a few dollars more"". Instead, she said, ""no"". In the future, will request Bill instead of Stephanie. Entrée (Lemon Sole on a bed of beets & butternut squash) was outstanding. Ironically, Calamari was best part of appetizer."
November 29, 2013|What a Find!|5|We planned to meet our three grandsons for a post-Thanksgiving lunch. We needed a restaurant that was half-way between Cape Cod and the New Haven area. Providence fit the bill. I read the reviews for Hemenway's and liked what I saw. We were not disappointed! Hemenway's was everything we wanted and more. Excellent in every respect-- from the service to the food to the atmosphere. We all are looking forward to our next visit!
November 27, 2013|Great place to go before theatre|4|Great service. Very accommodating. Sister visiting from Colorado- had food allergies. Chef changed recipe to eliminate eggs. Great seafood.
November 25, 2013|Great food and a good time|5|Took the way whole family (wife and three children - ages 17, 16 and 14). We all loved it. Great raw bar and seafood appetizers. Everyone loved their entrees. The macaroni and cheese with lobster was a hit as was the seafood casserole. Loved the desserts as well.
November 23, 2013|Late dinner|5|Arrived at 9:30 and had a wonderful dinner. I had whole rainbow trout wrapped in prosciutto and my husband had the seafood casserole. Our server was amazing, very friendly and helpful. Oysters and shrimp for appetizer was also outstanding. Drink menu is extensive but I know from pervious visits that the wine list is great too. Cleared out quickly after 9, great time to beat the rush.
November 23, 2013|Great Visit to Providence|5|I was meeting a friend that I haven't seen in 18 years. We chose Hemenway's just because the name stood out when we did a good search for restaurants in Providence. I made a reservation for 9:15pm and we were immediately seated once we arrived. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. My date ordered the salmon and I ordered the seafood pasta. Both were delicious choices. I'll definitely be visiting this place again and I'll request the waiter (Danny) by name.
November 22, 2013|Always Excellent|5|I've been coming here for over 20 years. Best seafood between Boston and NYC. Short but diverse menu, HUGE wine list. The kitchen accomodated a special order without a blink. Outstanding atmosphere, unbelievable customer service by everyone. Definitely the place to tkae someone you want to impress, or have a nice upscale dinner. I never feel rushed here, no matter how busy they are. Our server Jaclyn couldn't have done anything better.
November 16, 2013|amazed|5|Frim the moment we were greeted at the door till the moment we left, the service, food & overall ambiance was exceptional, beyond oyr expectations, & our waitress Amanda went beyond & above
November 16, 2013|Excellent|5|Got surf and turf with the filet and two pound lobster, was an excellent meal. Very expensive here but you get what you pay for, so be ready to pay but you'll enjoy wonderful meals.
November 16, 2013|Food had zero taste|2|Seafood Pasta was like it was from the frozen food aisle at Stop and Shop. The tuna was ok but nothing special. Overall the food at this place continues to go down. The choices are becoming limited and the flavor gone.
November 16, 2013|A birthday celebration!|5|A familiar and reliable destination. Fresh oysters were excellent. The attention and service always good but especially Saturday night because my daughter in law used to work there at least 12 years ago and she still knows many of the staff so it was like old home day! Food was good, not sensational especially for the price, but it always feels special.
November 15, 2013|Excellent as expected|5|"This has become our ""go to"" place in Providence. Great place to have a drink before dinner and a fantastic seafood menu. Never disappoints."
November 15, 2013|Great catch|5|If you enjoy fresh seafood Hemenways is the best in Providence.
November 14, 2013|wonderful|1|Food and service were fabulous! A great find close to the airport.
November 14, 2013|Service makes a difference|3|I typically leave feeling like I had an epic lunch and white glove treatment. The service struggled on this visit. The hostess overlooked that I was waiting to be seated for my 11:45 reservation and answered two phone calls instead of taking me to my table. Our first server was fantastic, however she was apparently shifted to a more important table and the only time we saw her after getting our beverages was when she brought the bill. Our replacement servers, plural, were rushed and made us feel like an inconvenience. Also, there was never an explanation for the server change, which would have been much more acceptable than the way it was handled. Lastly, we had to wave down our replacement servers for beverage refills, and the check.
November 13, 2013|Great dinner, Fair lunch.|5|In Providence for a conference, thought we'd try Hemenway's. Dinner was terrific with excellent service. It was so good, we decided to go back for lunch the next day. Exceptionally slow service (nearly an hour and a half w/no coffee or desserts) and was rather disappointed in the lobster roll.
November 10, 2013|Awesome!!|5|Service and food was outstanding. We went for my daughters 16th birthday party with a big group. I can't say enough great things, thank you.
November 9, 2013|Love this place|5|Every time we come here we have a really good time. The food was great and the waitress was wonderful. We would recommend this restaurant to everybody.
November 8, 2013|Hemenways Always a Great Tradition|5|Always to be counted on for a great setting, enticing menu and GREAT service. The whole experience has taken a step-up under the ownership of the Newport Harbor Restaurant Group. One of the great things about Hemenways now is that the menu has something of superior quality and interest for everyone. Whether it is fish, fowl or beef (even vegetarian) I think you will be delighted by your entrée and charmed by the carefully trained staff. Highly recommended!
November 8, 2013|Great Escape|4|Hemenways simply provided my wife and I with a well deserved escape from the frantic pace that too many of us have accepted as normal. Despite arriving early for a 7:30 reservation on a Friday evening, we were seated immediately and greeted with a sincere welcome. We mentioned that we were in no particular hurry, requested one of our favorite wines and proceeded to enjoy a truly relaxing evening in Providence. The Cioppino was served hot and hearty, just as I prefer it and my wife's shrimp entree was excellent as well. I had informed Hemenways, through my reservation via Open Table, that it was my wife's birthday and they discretely presented us with a very nice dessert to conclude a wonderful evening.
November 8, 2013|special night out|4|It was very easy to make reservations for this restaurant. We were very happy to be sat down at our table as soon as we got there. The staff was very pleasant and our waitress did a great job, happy that she kept coming back to check on how things were going. The clam chowder is excellent here, love it. My swordfish dish was cooked to perfection and chocolate cake for dessert left me wanting more. So good
November 4, 2013|Ambience and Great Seafood|5|Hememway's has the best selection of oysters you will ever find plus incredible raw bar offerings. The not so secret half price raw bar on Monday's is such a great deal. The restaurant is such a nice blend of chic and casual that makes it so inviting. I wish I could box up the whole restaurant and take it back to my home state.
November 3, 2013|First time at Hemenway's|4|I've lived in Rhode Island for over four decades and never had a chance to visit this restaurant, although I always intended to do so eventually. Well, 'eventually' arrived in the form of a one-year dating anniversary with my girlfriend. Making the reservation through OpenTable was extremely easy - and the staff at Hemenway's paid attention to my note in the reservation in that it was a special occasion. Our server, Louise, took special care of us, from our champagne toast through our delicious calamari appetizer through our sumptuous entrées to dessert. She made sure our wine glasses were filled at any moment and was never intrusive. Now that I know what I've been missing, we will definitely return.
November 3, 2013|Everything was wonderful-an|5|Everything was wonderful-an added perk, the wine was 1/2 off every bottle ordered for each entree
November 2, 2013|catching up with friends|4|The ambience if fine though can be a little noisy. Our table was ready right at our reservation time and they held it for us while we got to have a drink at the bar. Everyone enjoyed their meal, especially the Salmon and Halibut. It had been 5 years since we'd visited Hemenway but we will be back much sooner, more than likely in the next few weeks
October 31, 2013|Great!!|5|Great is the best word to describe dining at Hemenway's. Whether you're having a nice lunch with a friend or business colleage, or planning a nice dinner with family and friends, Hemenway's is a perfect place to dine. The seafood menu is fantastic and it also has other choices for the non-seafood lover! Great appetizers and a raw bar as well. I have been dining there for almost thirty years and it has been consistently good!
October 26, 2013|slow and cold|2|The salmon entrée was cold when it arrived at the table, and the service was unbelievably slow.
October 22, 2013|Do you love oysters?|5|If you love oysters, Hemenways is the place to get them in Providence! Fresh as though they just came out of the ocean at that moment you engage your palate! Our four course dinner we ordered was superb with every course including the freshest of coffee served at the table with dessert. A lovely dining experience for my companion and myself.
October 19, 2013|Great food.|4|Went to Hemenway's for first time. Great service. Clam chowder and tuna were delicious. Lobster ravioli were amazing!!
October 19, 2013|Birthday dinner|5|My husband took me to Hemenway's for my birthday and it was wonderful! Delicious food, great wine selection and attentive staff.
October 18, 2013|Very pleased with our first visit|5|This was my first visit and everything was great! Our server, Diane, was attentive and gave us excellent guidance on our menu choices. We started with Oysters Hemenway, which were excellent. My dining companion had the sushi-grade yellow fin tuna and I had baked scallops with asiago potatoes. The salads were also outstanding, both the Ceasar and the garden salad with the house dressing (honey curry? yummy!). We shared the banana cake with butterscotch sauce, etc. for dessert. Definitely make a reservation. It was noisy in the dining room, but that didn't bother us.
October 16, 2013|A very nice experience!|5|This has been our first time at Hemenway's. The food and service were very good, but the ambience was outstanding! We (my wife and myself) enjoyed it very much and will certainly come again!
October 14, 2013|Great night for half price raw bar|4|Good to grab some drinks and raw bar with friends ... Love this deal
October 13, 2013|Almost there!|3|I did not have any expectations about this restaurant. It was recommended by my inkeeper. I had never heard of the Newport Group. We made a reservation and were seated right away. The host was very friendly and accommodating. Our waitress was great. She made solid recommendations on every course. The atmosphere was comfortable and nice. My only concern was the actual food itself. The scallops wrapped in bacon was delicious and my stuffed shrimp was good. However, my rice pilaf was mushy and bland and my husband's halibut was dry and tasteless as were the sides that came with it. Hemenway's has the potential to be great if they can work on the food itself. Every dish that leaves the kitchen should be tasty.
October 12, 2013|First timer at Hemenways|4|Got last minute reservations online. Went during Waterfire celebration in downtown Providence. Awesome raw bar options and a seafood lover's dream at this place! Great service; very friendly. Definitely the place for a special night out or celebration.
October 12, 2013|Year after year|5|Consistently good on what is arguably one of the busiest weekends of the year--Columbus Day weekend Waterfire.
October 12, 2013|Great food, 'iffy' table location|4|We had made early dinner reservations for a Waterfire night in Providence. Understandably, the restaurant was hopping-busy - nonetheless, the food and service were fine. We each chose a meal from the prix fixe menu and were impressed with the quality and the presentation. However, we were seated at a tiny table-for-two, near a wait station, in a wide aisle between two rows of larger tables/booths. Traffic on either side throughout the meal was distracting to say the least -- esp. when servers came through carrying large plastic pails full of ice? oyster shells? whatever! However, it was a fine meal and we will definitely return. Next time I will request a quiet table away from the hustle of service...
Dined on October 12, 2013|Decent Meal|3|"Overall my party of 5 including wife and infant son, had a pleasant evening at Hemenway's. The staff was wonderfully welcoming. For the parents out there, it was surprisingly conducive to bringing a child as long as the kid does well with background noise. The oysters and other appetizers were wonderful, but unfortunately the entrees left a little to be desired. We had ordered the swordfish which tasted a bit ""fishy"" and scallops which were good but not great. Overall it was a good experience but I felt the food could have been better for the price."
October 8, 2013|I brought a party of 6 here|4|I brought a party of 6 here because they were looking for good seafood and service. I made the reservation on line and they called to confirm the day of the dinner. We were not disappointed. The service was timely, the seafood was fresh and well prepared. The wines were excellent and affordable. We all left saying we would return.
October 7, 2013|Great find!|5|Flew in on a business trip and found this plsce by mistake...what a find! Truly, one of the best I've experienced in New England.
October 7, 2013|This is one of the best seafood|4|This is one of the best seafood restaurants in Providence.
October 5, 2013|all good|5|"From ""soup to nuts"" Hemenways was wonderful. Excellent food, service, atmosphere."
October 5, 2013|Lunch at Hemenways|5|Excellent experience! Free valet parking at lunchtime. Greeted at the door. Table overlooking the river. Delightful server. Diverse menu. Good prices! Will go again.
October 4, 2013|Hemenway's Night out|5|Was in Providence for a wedding.. everyone did there own thing on Friday... and after we all compared our Friday night dinner... with our a question, we had the best dinning experience... and Providence has a ton of great places... our appetizers were first rate, salad was great, and the entree was outstanding.. the clams and mussels were supper fresh, the lobster mac and cheese was loaded with lobster, and the scallops were to die for... A five stare night... Thank you
October 1, 2013|Great experience|5|Service and food were some of the best I've ever had. Our server, Diane, was one of the most attentive waiters I've ever had!
September 29, 2013|We had an excellent dinner|5|We had an excellent dinner as always!! Half price wine on Sunday was also very nice!!
September 29, 2013|Excellent Food|5|Excellent Food. Excellent Service. I can't wait to return.
September 28, 2013|Not so good|2|First off it took forever for our waiter to come even give us water and then take the order. The waiter had a table of six, five and then is table of two, I believe he was more worried about the big tables then making everyone happy. The main dish was disappointing the seafood pasta! We would never go back.
September 28, 2013|Great food, terrific service|5|Great food, terrific service in a beautiful restaurant. The signature stuffed lobster that my daughter ordered was the hit of the table. Danny our server was entertaining as well as offering extensive knowledge of the menu. A perfect night with my wife, daughters and friends.
September 28, 2013|Family favorite|5|We have been going to Hemenway's for years with the whole family. The food is great and the staff is outstanding. I enjoy the food, the vibe of the place, and its location. I highly recommend for a good night out, a good date, night and place to celebrate with family and friends. Destiny was our server during the last visit to Hemenway's. She was attentive, friendly, and eager to help us with our menu selections.
September 28, 2013|Always hits the mark|5|The freshest seafood prepared with finesse. The raw bar is exquisite.
September 27, 2013|Consistently Excellent|5|My wife and I always have a great time dining at Hemenway's. Food is great, service tops and atmosphere totally relaxing.
September 26, 2013|Raw Bar and Appetizers|4|Excellent drinks, raw bar, appetizers. Main dish good but not outstanding. Service extremely well meaning, but in training so hard to evaluate what it is usual, though I think safely four stars.
September 24, 2013|Group dinner|5|Went here with friends that I only see once a year. Great food and high energy. The gluten free menu had plenty of options and the manager visits with all of those who order from the gluten free menu. Top notch service and excellent wine list. Would reconmend for groups of friends.
September 24, 2013|Weeknight Birthday|5|Hemenway's is always consistently outstanding. There is nothing that you can be critical about. The menu, the preparation, the service is always just right on target. Then add in the complimentary parking in the covered garage and you have a great experiance from the time you leave your car with the valet. This location is one of Providence Rhode Islands true gems. Other restaurents should benchmark Hemenway's for how it should be done.
September 22, 2013|Awesome Experience|5|You've got yo eat here! We had aa greaat tale at the window facing the river and skyline. Our waiter Theresa B. was a delight - her exceptional knowledge of the menu was partly due to the fact she is a chef also - hope you get her! The meal was outstanding. The crab leg appie was very good as was the clam chowder. We had a dish of scampi with linguinni & the baked stuffed shrimp - very nicely presented and very tasteful..The stuffed shrimp were a bit rich but was still very good. Don't miss going to this restaurant.
September 21, 2013|Great location to enjoy Waterfire|3|Guaranteed (complimentary) parking,fine seafood and a view of Waterfire,it's a win:win situation!
September 21, 2013|Made our special occasion memorable|5|Very accommodating, great service. Excellent food! A must go if you're in Providence and enjoy good local seafood. I've never had the steaks there but they looked wonderful as they went by. :)
September 21, 2013|Nice spot|4|Good eatery, service prompt and quality of food is very good, good place to go when visiting waterfire.
September 21, 2013|Favorite|5|Hemenway's is one of my favorite restaurants. I always go there for oysters, they are always fresh and served cold as they should be. All the seafood is fresh and tasty.
September 21, 2013|Outstanding|5|The seafood was truly outstanding. We were in a booth and it was warm, not enough air movement. We spoke to the manager and it was corrected. Our second time there and it was just as great as the first.
September 21, 2013|Great Experience|4|My Dad and I had a great experience at Hemenways. Our waiter was outstanding and the food was excellent, A pleasant start for our Waterfire experience
September 21, 2013|One of the best|4|Hemenway's is one of our favorite restaurants in Providence. It is convenient, free parking, excellent and courteous service, attention to food allergies, fresh seafood, and a good place to take friends. Always busy so reservations are usually very helpful.
September 20, 2013|Wonderful seafood!!|5|It is a really classy restaurant with fabulous food. Diane was a superb server, always attentive to our needs, knowledgeable about the menu and the wines available. I had scallops as an appetizer (next time I will order this as the main dish as it was enormous!) and was impressed by the size and tastiness of the dish. I followed with a fabulous lobster salad, just the right choice -- and I brought home half of it for my lunch on Monday! My spouse started with crab and lobster cakes -- yum -- and then had scallops, which she adored. We ended with an incredible chocolate cake. The wines were great. And the bill at the end was surprisingly low. Amazing, classy touch: they give you black napkins if you are wearing dark pants or skirt!!
September 18, 2013|Is this as good as it gets?|2|Providence's top rated restaurant wouldn't make the top 10 list in almost every city where I've dined. There were no clams in the clam chowder, and the waiter and restaurant manager seemed incredulous that I brought it up. The halibut was overcooked. The wine selection was limited. Whatever ambiance could have been created was nullified by an unruly child at a table behind us.
September 17, 2013|Perfect choice|5|Being from Oklahoma when we're East, we love to grab some fresh seafood. This place was fabulous. So happy we chose it on our one night in Providence. Staff was attentive and food was amazing. It's a must go spot for sure!!!
September 16, 2013|Hemenway's: excellent food and view|5|My wife and I ate at Hemenway's in mid-September on a Monday night and had an excellent meal. Try the house dressing: honey and curry. I know. Sounds weird but it was great. Complimentary valet parking good for 3 hours. Fabulous view of the river. We loved it.
September 14, 2013|One of Providence's Gems|5|We have been dining at Hemenway's a few times a year for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. On this particular occasion (our wedding anniversary) we were seated at a 2 top table, which was okay of course for 2 people, but my husband is a very tall man and it was obvious that he was uncomfortable. We didn't have to say a word; one of the managers came to the table, said that the server noticed that he looked uncomfortable and they swiflty moved us to a 4 top table and a window seat to boot ( a bonus as it overlooks the Providence River!) I can never say enough about the food here; it is consistently cooked to perfection and delicious every time! Kudos to Hemenways for remaining one of our favorites for over 20 years!
September 14, 2013|Providence Gem|5|Excellent experience all around. Great atmosphere, food and service. Pricy but worth it. Has upscale, trendy feel. Classy Casual!
September 9, 2013|Not what we expected|2|How long does it take to shuck 12 oysters? Lobster was dry. Steak way overlooked to the point that they removed it from the grill. Definitely not on my list places to visit again. Server was very nice however and the wine selection was good
September 7, 2013|Great for waterfire dining|4|I ate here with friends during Waterfire. The location is super convenient, and the food was great.
September 7, 2013|So So|2|We had reservations and a party of three. We were seated at a table designed for two. The table was very crowded with our dishes, food and drinks. The side salads were miniscule. I had the Georges Banks scallops and rice pilaf. Five itsy - bitsy scallops and two tablespoons of rice. I am all for healthy eating and healthy portions, but this was ridiculous. The waitress was ok but seemed very rushed. We had to ask her to refill our drinks. I work in Providence and come here several times a year for lunch and dinner. Usually Hemenways is a good event. This was definitely a disappointing experience.
September 7, 2013|A Great Night|5|We had not been back to Hemenway's for a while but had a group in town for Waterfire. The food was excellent, we had a member of our party with a food allergy and they could not have been more accommodating including the Manager coming up to the table to assure us they could and would take care of our needs. Bill our waiter was fantastic, even had a funny story to tell. The restaurant was very busy but we were seated as soon as we arrived. At the end of the evening, we had exceeded our parking validation by 15 minutes but the valet comp'd it to cap of a wonderful night. Thank You Hemenway's.
September 6, 2013|great find!|5|we consider ourselves foodies and we enjoyed our anniversary celebration! the food was amazing! I think I have told 15-20 people that they have to go! I work in a very popular restaurant and when I tell my customers where I go to eat..they go!
September 6, 2013|loved it|4|The Vodka martini was great, not watered down and was served in chilled glass. Apps from the raw bar were really fresh tasting. Entrees also very good. Booth table was near the bar but it wasn't too noisy and felt private enough. Would definitely recommend and go back.
September 6, 2013|Anniversary Celebration|5|Every time we dine at Hemenway's is a special occasion - consistently excellent.
August 31, 2013|Very nice environment, great|4|Very nice environment, great service. However, the halibut was too dry. Otherwise, it was a good experience.
Dined on August 31, 2013|Incredible Anniversary Dinner|5|We had an incredible Anniversary Dinner. The crab and lobster cakes were delicious and the halibut was the best fish I have ever had. We can't wait to go back!
August 31, 2013|Great Lunch|5|Had a great lunch for 5 on Sat. August 31. My wife and I were entertaining 3 guests from China so we ordered a seafood platter and several plates form the appetizer section and shared each one. Our server, Miranda, understood exactly what we wanted and did a great job bringing each one out in succession with perfect timing. Each dish was so good - it was impossible to chooose a favorite. The entire staff was excellent and the restaurant superb. We live in N J but hope we have an opportunity to go back another time and sample more of the menu.
August 30, 2013|Terrific!|5|Very welcoming from the outset (and accommodated our early arrival on a busy Saturday night). Great fresh seafood, objective recommendations from our good natured and helpful waiter. Dined with our two young son's, and had a very pleasant experience.
August 29, 2013|Best seafood ever.|5|Everything was excellent.Waiter was very attentive and made some good recommendations.I don't remember having seafood this delicious anywhere I've been,and I have traveled quite a bit.This restaurant was said to be best in the city and they were'nt lying.
August 26, 2013|Lobster!|5|As always very good. Try the lobster fisherman's style with shrimp and scallops. Wow!
August 24, 2013|Water fire|5|We dined at Hemenway's around 6:30 on a Water Fire night in downtown Providence. We had a view of the boats getting ready for the festivities which we enjoyed. We would not have been able to see the lighting of the fires from our seats, but we saw everything by walking along the river. We enjoyed the restaurant, the food, and the server.
August 24, 2013|We especially appreciate the|5|We especially appreciate the effort to accommodate three late attendees to our group. Even though they couldn't be seated with us, the hostess was able to find a table for them inside. That got the evening of to a great start.
August 24, 2013|great dinner before Waterfire|4|It was our first trip to Hemenways and our first trip to Waterfire. Our server, Dan, took great care of us and gave us wonderful recommendations on the menu and what to see at Waterfire. We arrived a little late for our reservation (although we did call) and the restaurant staff was very gracious about accommodating us on their busiest night of the week. We had a great dinner and had fun watching the crowds gather for Waterfire. We then were able to walk over a few steps to see the spectacular on the river right after a great meal.
August 24, 2013|HEMENWAYS 8-24-2013|3|The table was as we requested. However, unlike previous visits we were not made to feel special as we celebrated our anniversary. Perhaps water fire had something to do with that as the restaurant was over crowded with extra tables added. Not the same Hemenways as before the Newport Restaurant Group acquired it. We may give it one more try on a not so busy night.
August 24, 2013|Great Meal, Convenient to Waterfire|4|It was such a beautiful evening we could have been just as happy eating outside, but we chose a window table and got to keep an eye on the Waterfire preparations. Swordfish and tuna dinners were delicious and service was great! Overall a bit pricey but it helps a lot to get validated parking in the adjacent garage.
August 23, 2013|Food and service were fine|4|Food and service were fine but the noise level was LOUD! Pleasant ,fun atmosphere and varied age groups . The waitress went out of her way to make helpful suggestions and was very pleasant and knowledgeable.FRESH , raw little necks were great as was my salmon.
August 23, 2013|a great dining experience|4|beyond the very good service, seafood and location downtown by the riverwalk, inside you'll find a variety of spaces, each with a separate atmosphere, almost like being in a different restaurant. Check out the lobster tank and raw bar. It would be a treat just going in for a drink in the middle of the general movement of people and dishes.
August 23, 2013|Great Restaurant|4|"We love Hemenway's. Anytime we have guest visiting from out of town it is our ""go-to-place""."
August 23, 2013|Great service!|5|Good seafood and great service with a nice view of the river!
August 21, 2013|Great place for entertaining|4|Great place for entertaining business clients. Food is fantastic and menu options are vast.
August 19, 2013|Hollie|5|My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our anniversary on Monday, August 19th. Hollie was an excellent server. By far one of the best waitresses I have ever experienced. She was extremely efficient and extremely knowledgeable when discussing the menu with us. We would most certainly come back and would also recommend her to our friends.
August 19, 2013|A mixed bag|3|We started off with a seafood tower appetizer. The lobster was nicely opened and fresh as was all the raw product. My dining partner had the Paella and I had the Swordfish. The Paella was nicely arranged with ample shellfish. We both agreed it was a touch under seasoned. My Swordfish was at best average. Sadly the garnish, two artichoke halves, had better sear marks and more flavorful taste than the fish. For dessert we had the berry tart and the key lime pie. The key lime pie was the star. Very flavorful with a nice graham cracker crust. The berry tart was a disaster. It was clearly pre-frozen and microwaved to heat it up. What a disappointment. The rolls were not up to the standards of a top shelf restaurant. Service was great.
August 16, 2013|Good meal|4|We were in town to visit a college and after a long day, it was nice to find this place. Its a bit hidden but once you find it, is very good. Parking lot attached and is validated so free parking. Nice tables, not to close and a very good selection of fresh seafood.
August 14, 2013|Consistently Excellent|5|Always a memorable experience with excellent food, service and atmosphere.
August 12, 2013|New England Seafood Fav|5|Time and time again, I meet New Englander's coming here for the raw bar. The seared and grilled selections are great, too. They have consistently good service, food, drinks, and ambience. It is simply a must-do Providence, RI.
August 10, 2013|Everything was great except|5|the clams casino were rubber. Everything else was fresh and well prepared. The service was second to none!
August 10, 2013|Food Good, Service is Horrible!|3|We sat at the bar and ate since the reservations were running behind. The food was good, but the service at the bar was horrible. The bar was not even busy. We wanted to order dessert and an after dinner drink, but by the time that a bartender made it over to our side of this small bar, we just wanted the check. We figured that it would have been quicker to go somewhere else to get dessert. IF every time that you need something, you have to yell out for a bartender, it is time to get new bartenders. After telling the manager, the manager had the expression that he just could not care in the least bit.
August 8, 2013|First-timer|5|I was recommended the restaurant by locals, Great atmosphere with views of the Riverwalk. The portions were amazing.
August 7, 2013|Disappointed on service, Food VG|3|I've been going here for a long time but this past experience was disappointing and it was mainly because of the service. Meals came out halfway through our appetizer. A couple sides were wrong and salad dressing was wrong. Forgot someone's cup of chowder. Not the experience I'm used to here. This guy tries to memorize the orders but he does a terrible job at it and as a result half of the stuff is wrong or forgotten. The food here is always good and I wouldn't let this stop me from returning.
August 3, 2013|Great place|4|Outstanding manegment and staff, best seafood in providence
August 1, 2013|Excellent for fresh seafood|4|A local treasure with a well-deserved reputation for quality. Not pretentious, but nice enough for business or special occasions too. Highly recommended.
July 30, 2013|Consistently Good|4|We eat here often. We love the space and can always rely on consistently good food and service.
July 30, 2013|Seafood at its finest|4|It's not easy being the premier seafood restaurant in the hometown of the worlds largest culinary arts college, however, Hemmingways pulls it off with style and grace!
July 30, 2013|4th time there!|5|Every time we go, the service and food never disappoint. Steamers, cherrystones, scallops...no matter what seafood we ordered it was fresh and delicious.
July 28, 2013|We have been to Hemenway's|5|We have been to Hemenway's on more than one occassion. Each time we have sat in a diferent area of the restaurant and no matter where we sat we had a great view of the river and surrounding park. The food is always outstanding and the specials are always different. It has been difficult to try somehting different of the menu because I love what I had the time before. We have gone for anniversary, Valentines Day, and taken family and friends as a thank you to them. We will definitely come back.
July 27, 2013|Excellant Service|5|Superb experience all around! Host, server, cook, and bartender.
July 27, 2013|From the moment we walked|5|From the moment we walked through the door, the service was impeccable. The food was outstanding. Loved the atmosphere.

July 26, 2013|the food and service were|5|the food and service were superb. everyone was attentive to the smallest detail and made us feel special.
July 26, 2013|On the River|4|Hemenway's is a real find. A little out of the way (one way street) but a great location right on the river with a park next door. Very accomodating; we were late due to traffic but they seated the rest of our party anyway. Great service. Food was excellent. Martini was done right. Fried food not overly greasy. Request for low salt meal was accomodated. A little noisy. We were away from the river side but our view was the Great Stone Bank with it's glass tower. Expensive but worth it for a festive occasion.
July 26, 2013|Great Food|4|The food and the service were excellent. I was taking out of town business guests for dinner. All was great until a large table of kids came in: it became so loud, it destroyed the ambience. I would go elsewhere if you wanted a place to have business discussions but I would go back with my family.
July 25, 2013|No better place for seafood|5|No better place for seafood in the entire Boston-Providence area. Sit at the bar on Friday or Saturday and be fully entertained by Staci, Alyssa, Eric and Cody...combined with stellar service.
July 24, 2013|Service was superlative and|4|Service was superlative and the food is very nicely prepared. The high glass enclosed booths have very good sound insulation from neighboring tables. I would definitely return to this establishment!
July 23, 2013|Food did not live up to the|3|Food did not live up to the description/hype given by our waitress. The fish preparations were adequate, not great. We left feeling disappointed. We did think the overall atmosphere was very good inside and out.
July 22, 2013|its been better|3|We have been here before and I have to say the menu isnt as good as it was. The prices are astronomical and im not sure we will return. The food was good but I can get just as good of a meal someplace else for a fraction of the cost.
Dined on July 20, 2013|Perfect Dinner|5|Waitstaff was excellent. Food was outstanding- Perfect way to celebrate a birthday!
July 20, 2013|Spectacular river front dining!|5|A wonderful seafood restaurant in downtown Providence. Super fresh seafood served in unique ways! Crab-Lobster Cakes were incredible! The prix fix $29 menu was wonderful too! Will be our regular go-to seafood destination.
July 20, 2013|Not Happy at Hemenways|2|We had previously enjoyed several very good meals over the past ten years but I was very disappointed with the service and quality of the meal served. The antipasto was a waste of money, the lobster bisque was tasteless and the burger was no better than what you can get at Wendy's. Dessert was adequate. Steve
July 19, 2013|Dinner|5|We had a party of 6 and Hemenway's was able to accommodate all of us. Our server was amazing and had helpful hints about dinner and wine, she was very knowledgeable. We all had a wonderful first time experience at Hemenway's and really look forward to going back!
July 19, 2013|Great Place|5|My husband and I really enjoyed our lunch at Hemenway's. We hadn't been in years and found the food and service great.
July 17, 2013|Better than ever!|5|We have eaten at Hemenway's many times but this visit was even more exceptional! There were a variety of oysters which were all fresh and delicious. The Caesar salad was subtle, not gooey or overdressed, and came with (optional) anchovies. We each had the pan seared halibut served on a vegetable hash with peas, asparagus, potato coins and chanterelles, as best as I can recall. Perfectly prepared - a thick slice of juicy fish atop a delightful veggie mix. Recommend the Sancerre to go with this terrific dish. Service was attentive but not rushed. We had a wonderful time!
July 17, 2013|Special occasion for seafood lovers|5|Hemenway's is the best place for a special occasion dinner with my seafood-loving family. Even better if we can go at mid-day, because the luncheon menu is less expensive and meals a bit lighter. You get what you pay for at dinner, but it's more than I can finish.
July 16, 2013|Hemenway's is always great|5|Hemenway's is always great ... just love it there. The food and service are both top notch. Highly recommended.
July 16, 2013|Good food, good service...but..|2|"The food were very good. I had the seafood broil and it was very tender and tasty. The lobster bisque was also very good. Our waitress was very attentive. When I got home I checked my email and it said that Hemenway's had canceled my Open Table reservation around the time we arrived. I called the the hostess said that she remembered seating us and that she did not know what happened, but that she would manually credit the visit right away. Two hours later, the credit was not posted, so I called and asked for the manager. Heather talked to me and she said she could not ""back credit"" but if I REALLY NEEDED those points, I should make a reservation for that night and she would credit my account. Very poor customer service !"
July 16, 2013|I have come to this restaurant|5|I have come to this restaurant for 28 years. I love the food, the people and everything. THE BEST!
July 15, 2013|Always delicious|4|The food was delicious as always. We were in the back room which was great until a large party was seated there too. It became very noisy but we were luckily almost finished.
July 14, 2013|Oysters and fried belly clams|4|Oysters and fried belly clams great Hemenway's chowder tasty, but too heavy, creamy, and very few bits of clam
July 14, 2013|Scrumptious food and great view|5|Have been here many times and keep coming back. The fish dishes are always fresh, light and prepared with interesting sides. The service is friendly and helpful. The view of the Providence River just makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. We watched kayakers paddle by, and many people out for a nice walk. Great location!
July 13, 2013|Great Ambience Ruined|1|"We were ready for a great romantic dinner for the waterfire event. We sat at the bar taking in the ambience of the restaurant, which was shattered by the unprofessional arguements of the staff behind the bar. Food was ""dropped"" down, there was no check back about how things were cooked or how we were. Expensive dinners should be matched by service this one def was not!"
July 13, 2013|Restaurant week|3|This was our first visit loved the valet parking the restaurant was beautiful appearance of food looked great was probably not the best time to go during restaurant week no big savings portions small would like to try again another time the view is beautiful and I like the outside dining
July 13, 2013|Can't cook|1|The swordfish went back twice. First for tasting lick a salt lick. Second time for coming out like leather! Absolutely Terrible!
July 13, 2013|First time|4|We had way too much food but that was our choice. We had never been at Hemenways so we decided to order a fair amount of food.... and it was all very good. Service was also very good. Parking was quite easy because of the garage connected to the restaurant. We will return.
July 13, 2013|One of the best restaurants ever!|5|My husband and I visited Providence for the first time and we were only in town for 2 days. We decided to dine at Hemmenway's on a Saturday night even though we could only get a 4:30 reservation. It was everything we could ask for in a restaurant....food, atmosphere and pleasant people and the restaurant was beautifully situated on the canal....my only complaint was we could not get a table by the window overlooking the water even at 4:30 Next time I will definitely specifically ask to be by the window so we can dine by the spectacular view
July 12, 2013|Wow!|5|Hemenway's offers great food nicely presented with the superb, classic service that is all too rare these days. The menu offers something for every taste and never disappoints. Can't wait to go back! One of the best in a city known for great dining.
July 12, 2013|Food and service were excellent!|4|Food and service were excellent! We will definitely be back!
July 12, 2013|Great anniversary date night|5|We went to Hemenway's for our tenth wedding anniversary. We felt that the staff went out of their way to make our dinner special. I had the halibut and my wife had the scallops. Both dishes were excellent. I highly recommend the clams casino for an appetizer and the three fruit tort for dessert. Superb!
July 12, 2013|Wonderful|5|Our server Annie was wonderful. The food is delicious. Great wine list. Really good kids menu and very kid-friendly.
July 12, 2013|A group of 5 retired women|4|A group of 5 retired women went to lunch at Hemenway's. The restaurant was effecient, clean and ver accommodating. Food was high quality. All said that they would return. Floor to ceiling windows gave a bright and enjoyable atmosphere and great view.
July 11, 2013|Always a good choice!|4|If you like fresh seafood, especially oysters, this is the place. Food is always fresh and beautifully presented. Can be noisy on a busy night. Worth a trip.
July 11, 2013|Great seafood|5|Really good value on the special menu, and fine service. The clams were excellent
July 11, 2013|Very pleasant!|4|Hemenway's was just what we were looking for in Providence, a seafood restaurant for lunch in a pretty locale.
July 10, 2013|R week lunch menu: quality deal|5|It was lunch of four parties consisted of my colleagues. I have ever tried both clam chowder and lobster bisque for appetizer - both are great. The seafood broil for entree is my favorite - honestly, the dinner menu and the lunch menu have much similarity, and the only difference is, they serve more scallops & shrimps for the dinner than fewer scallops but more fish for the lunch. White Chocolate Mousse is my favorite dessert at Hemenway's. In all, I have never seen a better quality dinning deal than the lunch menu at Hemenway's during the restaurant.
July 9, 2013|great choice for restaurant weeks|5|The Hemenway's serves excellent clam chowder, seafood broil and white chocolate mousse. The price is surprisingly low during the restaurant week. For the restaurant week menu, the lunch menu has around 50% similar to that of the dinner menu.
July 8, 2013|Nice lunch|4|Half price raw bar on Mondays was a nice touch. Loved the crab and shrimp. Fish and chips were great as was the bisque ... Wouldn't have the broiled seafood again. Service was wonderful by Maura. Best service i have had at Hemengways !! Thank you
July 6, 2013|can't go wrong|5|once again, a great meal was had at Hemenway's! From the fanatastic oysters- Cape Cod- to the Ahi Tuna that was delightful and the Paella...just what is expected. Great seafood, great drinks and outdoor eating, what more can you ask for?
July 6, 2013|Food is Fabulous|4|"For starters, we ordered Oysters Hemenway (spinach, parmesan cheese) and a starter combination including scallops wrapped in bacon, clams casino and calamari. They were all very good. The entrees were great, definitely at ""10"". I got the Filet and it was better than Ruth's Chris. It came with an asiago potato that was crazy awesome. My friend got the lobster mac and cheese and of course I had to try it. It is the best I have ever had!"
July 6, 2013|Hemenway's|4|"Hemenway's in Providence has excellent ambiance, exceptional service and very good food. In addition, while I expected the menu to be high in cost, we were pleasantly surprised to find the food to be moderately priced, for this type of restaurant. I was very disappointed with the New England Clam Chowder. When I was asked by our waiter how the soup was, I was honest and told him that I was disappointed with how thick the soup was...too ""floury"". I did not expect it, but the management comped my soup on our bill. A nice touch."
July 6, 2013|The atmosphere, service and|5|The atmosphere, service and food were outstanding. This is the third time I have been to Hemenway's and each time was outstanding.....
July 3, 2013|Nice Meal|4|We enjoyed a very nice meal at Hemenway's. Our oyster appetizer featured very fresh, delicious raw osters. Wine list was good. Chowder was good. Our server, Theresa, was very knowledgable and helpful. She really goes above and beyond in terms of efficient, but not overpowering, service. My scallops dish was wonderful, as was my husband's ravioli dish. Dining room was full; atmosphere was fun. Recommended!
July 3, 2013|Fabulous in every way....|5|Fabulous in every way.... outside dining with singer Steve Palumbo created the perfect evening.
June 29, 2013|40th Anniversary Dinner|5|This is our go to spot for special occasions. We always make time to have a drink at the bar as it is a small but classic set up. The bartender Eric was congenial and attentive. Upon transfer to the table he brought our drinks over followed by a rose he constructed from a cocktail napkin. It complimented the rose petals on our table that the staff arranged. Table service was excellent as usual. Our server (Jaclyn?) was terrific just the right touch of attention without overdoing it. We had a riverside window table great for the occasion. Great oyster selection, fantastic chowder and good not great entrees, salmon a little too done and the scallops were very good but the cauliflower puree was scant. Still a great experience.
June 28, 2013|great seafood, great conversation|5|watching a gondola float by was the icing on the cake! every dish we ordered was cooked to perfection. the wine, the food and the atmosphere makes this restaurant a wonderful night out. friendly staff along with great service also made our meal that much more enjoyable. would book a reservation here again in a heartbeat!
June 27, 2013|Al Fresco dining,with live music|4|Great (International) group,coupled with fine food.An excellent evening!
June 26, 2013|Hemenway's|4|I hate to write this but I think Hrnrnway's has slipped a little bit or it was an off night. Beautiful setting in the prettiest part of Providence, excellent service but food not as wonderful as I remember in the past. I would still go back but with lower expectations.
June 24, 2013|Great food!|5|Hemenway's is a great all around experience. Good food, service and atmosphere!
Dined on June 24, 2013|We thought the food was very|4|We thought the food was very good. Note that you are better off going there as a party of 4 or more because otherwise you end up sitting in the middle of tables with serves bumping and running all around you. Note also that when you make reservations on line you can only be seated in the main dining room. We have no idea what the other dining room was like but am sure it must of been quieter. Note that the service is good and efficient but it does give the customer a feeling of a factory line at times. I would recommend the seared scallops and for dessert the berries with fresh cream. The salmon was a bit overcooked. Overall, the food is very good and worth the trip
June 23, 2013|Never Disappoints|5|We meet our adult children here from time to time as it is about an hour drive to Providence for all of us. While we always enjoy our meal, this one was exceptional in all respects. Our server, Jenn, did much to add to the joy of the occasion and was spot on with her recommendations.
June 22, 2013|Great for that special date!!|5|Great place! Very romantic and the food was excellent! Service was top notch - could not have been more perfect!!! Great view of Providence and the river. Also nice outdoor dining if you want it.
June 21, 2013|43rd anniversary weekend getaway.|5|Wonderful food, nice room, scenic views, but what made this a great experience was our server Danny Colbert. He was charming , witty, knowledgeable, and caring. His descriptions of menu items would make your mouth water. His recommendations were spot on. He promptly and courteously took care of our every need, I would also like to thank the manager / general manager for doing what they could to get us a quiet romantic table as I had requested when I made the reservation. We here actually seated at the end of a Banquet with the adjacent table having been removed. In a large room filled with many customers, this special treatment was truly appreciated by us. The complementary Chanpagne toast was the cherry on the top . I thank you all !
June 21, 2013|Our server was very friendly,|5|Our server was very friendly, pleasant and well versed on all items on the menu. Quite impressed also that she did not write anything down yet everything was delivered to our table just as we had ordered. I would highly recommened the filet mignon, melt in your mouth tender. The pan seared scallops were also excellent. We finished our meal with a moist, delicious chocolate cake served with whipped cream. The entire meal was fantastic. The staff is very friendly ..

June 16, 2013|Another great meal!|5|We enjoyed a great meal here (as we have in the past). I tried the Paella for the first time and it was great! Started with fresh Shrimp Cocktail. My companion had the Clam Chowder and a cold seafood platter (and they allowed a substitution in the platter). Great service as always and not rushed.
June 16, 2013|Lovely Fathers Day meal. Great|5|Lovely Fathers Day meal. Great food and wonderful gluten free menu!
June 15, 2013|Excellent Food and Service|5|If you want fresh seafood, excellent service from a knowledgable staff that is customer focused the moment you walk in this is the place for your next diner party. The restaurant has a nice view of the city and is adjacent to a park which affords the restaurant some nice additional outdoor dining options. The staff was very helpful to a first time guest and their recommendations were terrific.
June 15, 2013|Great Experience|5|The view of the water and activity outside was a nice addition to a great meal. The later part of our service was a little slow, but we were a group of 7 and no one seemed to mind (I just noticed as the planner). Service was very professional at all times, and food was exceptional. I highly recommend for special occassions.
June 15, 2013|Although the restaurant was|4|Although the restaurant was not full, by any means.....we were denied a 6pm reservation. Why? Service was very good, pleasant servers, food yummy.
June 15, 2013|I love everything about this place|5|We have been dining here since 1987, since our first date. We come on every special occasion, and still enjoy every moment. The atmosphere is celebratory and upscale without being intimidating. The food is spot on, the raw bar to die for. A must-do for anyone looking for great seafood.
June 14, 2013|Enjoyed dinner|4|Great food. The view of the water and of Providence was amazing!
June 8, 2013|Friendly Service and Good Food|4|The experience at Hemmingways was very good overall. Our server had a great personality on top of being a prompt and thoughtful server. The food arrived in a timely manner and was tasty and fresh. I appreciated the tasting of an unfamiliar wine before choosing. The acoustics seemed alittle loud until the restaurant cleared somewhat. Nice casual atmosphere with views to the water.
June 8, 2013|Just OK|2|"I rate everything on the ""value"" scale ... for the price this place is a bit underwhelming. Everything is good, but it's not excellent. Our server did seem a bit too busy to give us excellent service (wait times on cocktails were long, etc.)"
June 6, 2013|Anniversary Dinner|5|Hemenway's is rated as the best seafood restaurant in Providence. It was a wonderful experience. My wife had something on the board and I had a trout dish off the regular menu. Both of us were very pleased. Definitely a place we will return to when we get to Providence again.
June 6, 2013|Enchanted evening!|5|Seven dined for a special occasion. Our wait staff was very friendly, knowledgable, and efficient. The restaurant's ambiance was appreciated by young and old alike!
June 5, 2013|Lovely place but food is sub-par|2|I recently went back to Hemenway's after many years. I really want to like it, and I have been here a few times, trying to find something that is really good on the menu, but perhaps I've had back luck with ordering. My last visit was no exception, as I thought the fish that topped my salad special was a little off. My colleague had to return her dish to have it cooked properly, so it wasn't just me being picky. The staff are super polite and the location just off the water is very nice, but I'm sorry to say that the food is not good.
June 1, 2013|Wonderful Experience!|5|"We have been coming to Hemenway's every year when we visit our daughter at RISD. This was the ""special"" dinner for the trip. For the last four years, Hemenway's has been consistently great and we have so enjoyed returning again and again. She just graduated so we are not sure when we will return. Hemenway's became a tradition for us and it never disappoints. We especially appreciate your staff for the great connections and fun evening."
May 31, 2013|While the food was very good,|3|While the food was very good, the service was slow and by the time the main entries came, we were ready to go. I have dined here previously and this has not been the case. It may have been due to graduation weekend for RISD.
May 31, 2013|Very disappointing|2|The steamers were excellent, but my husband's martini was not chilled and had too much vermouth, his entree had no flavor. The service was slow and distracted. Very unusual for this restaurant,. We may try again, but Providence offers so many great places it may be a long time.
May 31, 2013|Night out|5|I was in Providence for my 10 year college reunion and made reservations at Hemmenways...could not have been more happy with the night. We had an amazing dinner, clam chowder and oysters to start, salads, and then seafood casserole and fish. The food was just amazing! Our server was extremely attentive and was easy to talk to. Place was pristine and we had a great view of the river. We will be going back soon, the only tough decision will be what to order!
May 26, 2013|The food and ambiance at Hemenway's|5|The food and ambiance at Hemenway's was outstanding. My wife ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and we told they couldn't serve it because they weren't allowed to order drinks with multiple liquors. My wife ordered a double vodka on the rocks and we were told that came under the same rule, so we ordered two-single shots of vodka on the rocks. The server brought the first drink, but never brought the second one. When the bill came, we were charged for two Stoli Rocks. When I questioned the server she seemed oblivious that we hadn't received the second single vodka on the rocks. She then brought us the second drink because it was too difficult to remove it from the bill.
May 25, 2013|Elegant and Atmospheric|5|Hemenway's looks out over the Providence river through all glass walls enclosing the beautiful high-ceilinged dining room. Seafood and shellfish are in no short supply, with a water feature filled with prospective lobster greeting you at the door. The menu also features some alternatives for those not fond of fish. The service is crisp and professional, but not snobbish. Feels appropriate for date nights or special occasions. We visited during graduation weekend and 3/4 ordered the halibut special, which was excellent. Portions were generous, but we managed to save room for dessert.
May 25, 2013|Excellent seafood|5|Fresh and expertly prepared. The steamers were fantastic. The whole experience was first class.
May 24, 2013|hemenway's disappointing experience|1|Went to Hemenway's for an anniversary; typically go there for business meals. We sat in the small dining room in the back left corner. We noticed a cool breeze blowing down from the high ceiling, despite the weather being cold & rainy outside. We asked the waitress if she could reduce the blowers. The mgr came over; he stated the whole restaurant was on one thermostat, he would turn down the AC & it would take 10mins to take effect. The cold air continued to blow and when the waitress returned later with our meal, we strongly complained. We were both freezing! The mgr didn't return to interact with us, and we weren't offered an alternate table. The cold air was still blowing when we paid our check.
May 24, 2013|Great food, slow service|4|Food was great. We had a lobster blt and a salmon sandwich. Waiter took our order in a timely fashion, but after the meal was delivered, he was no where to be found. Ended up spending quite a bit of time waiting for the check. Overall, it was a very good experience.
May 23, 2013|Excellent Seafood Restaurant|5|We have been to this restaurant many times and are never disappointment by the food or service. This time we were there for lunch. Delicious!
May 22, 2013|Great Experience|5|I took my Mom for supper for her 89th birthday. She had never been before. (I have been numerous times) My mother can be very critical as most elderly can, and I was a little worried she would find something to pick on. I'm happy to report that she had nothing but good things to say. She loved the chowder, the shrimp scampi, the waiter and the surprise cake he brought in her honor. She said I can bring her back there anytime! Thank you for making this such a positive experience.
May 18, 2013|Not High on Hemenway's|2|The server told me that they were unable to serve popular drink - a Long Island Iced Tea. Never received a reason why they could not. The server was asked for a less incendiary cocktail sauce for the shrimp cocktail and brought more of the same. One diner ordered sautéed scallops and received them grilled. Two diners requested grilled asparagus and received steamed asparagus. The food was plated poorly. A 1st year culinary student at Johnson and Wales University would have done better. The tuna was served on top of rice that had no flavor.
May 17, 2013|Good Food, Good Service, Slow|4|We really had a wonderful dining experience at Hemenways. Really liked the validated valet parking garage right next door. Waiter was great, wine he suggested was awesome. Apps and salads came out fairly quickly, but entrees took a little while longer than expected. Worth the wait, though. The food quality and portion sizes were outstanding. The ambience was nice, if a bit loud- we had a nice view of the river (would be great for Waterfire!). Also, more reasonably priced than expected (party of 4- about $56 pp.). Would definitely go back and recommend to others.
May 16, 2013|We have eaten at Hemenway's|3|We have eaten at Hemenway's many times over the years and never have been disappointed with the quality of the food. This time was no exception. The food was delicious. The service, however, was rather slow. It was more than a half-hour from the time we got our menus to the serving of our meal, though the restaurant did not seem very busy at that time. Nor was the server very attentive. We will return to Hemenway's since this was an aberration in our experience, but it should be noted.
May 13, 2013|birthday|5|This is our 5 year of a group of us going to celcebrate my birthday. We request Catherine as waitress -terrific food and service outstanding. Lunch is reasonable price for special occassion.

May 11, 2013|Fabulous as usual|5|We go here whenever we are in the mood for awesome seafood. This was a special occasion so started with a bottle of Moet Chandon and then cherrystones followed by lobster and white chocolate mousse for dessert. All excellent as was our waitress. slmetimes we go just to sit at the bar or lounge area for a martini and their AWESOME cols seafood platter. A fabulous Waterfire Night place too.
Dined on May 11, 2013|Worth going back|4|There are dozens of excellent restaurants in town. This should be considered one of the top 10. Food, service and decor are very good. Nothing to complain about. It was a little loud but it was a Saturday night and you can't blame the management for the acoustics. I'll put this place in my regular rotation of places to dine. Prices are reasonable.
May 11, 2013|Excellent food and service|5|"Hemenway's is one of our ""goto"" places for the fancy dinner or Sunday lunch. We recently too my mother there for mother's day and got a lovely table overlooking the river. The only issue with the restaurant isn't with the restaurant, but parking. It's easy enough to park at the garage right next door and before the restaurant, but if you kiss it, you have to go down and around, which for some not familiar with Providence can be confusing."
May 10, 2013|Disappointed|2|Looking forward to a wonderful dinner - Started with oysters - bad choice- They were so small it , a few shells look empty - Do not understand how they would even serve them, .let alone charge for them. 2 out of the 4 entrees were ok - other 2 - fish dish and lobster - dried out - We used to love Hemingways- the atmoshere ,service and cocktails are still great - but the food is lacking - Unfortunately we won't be back
May 7, 2013|Good place for seafood|4|Everyone in our group of 8 enjoyed their entrees. A little more expensive than other places we dined at in Providence.
May 4, 2013|birthday dinner|2|the mussel appetizer was awful. The mussels were fishy tasting and soft. Too much salt was used on my meal ( mushroom ravoli) swordfish wasn't the best . Wouldn't go again.
May 4, 2013|Hemenway's keeps on giving...|4|We really enjoy our meals at this seafood restaurant in downtown Providence. Attentive service, great location, and good food are what we expect and what we continue to get.
May 3, 2013|Great fresh seafood.|5|The service was absolutely amazing. The food here is always good. This place always has very large lobsters in stock, 4-5+lbs.
May 3, 2013|Great Night Out|5|We had a great night out at Hemenway's for my wife and my dad's wife's birthdays. Great seat with a nice view, awesome service and fabulous food.
April 28, 2013|A Lovely Sunday Spent|5|We had never been to Hemenway's for lunch and we thought it was fantastic! Being Sunday, they only had the dinner menu, so it was a tad bit pricey. The food was perfect, and it was worth the expense. Additionally, out waitress, Debralee, was one of the best we have had anywhere. So incredibly knowledgable and well-stated. She had a strong understanding of the menu and gave very thoughtful recommendations, from the tea I ordered right down to the entrees. She is a cut above the rest and a definite reason to return. We will be back!
April 27, 2013|Food and service was excellent.|4|Food and service was excellent. Have not been here in a few years so I was disappointed in the menu change. Always enjoyed picking out a fish, swordfish etc and choosing how it was cooked. Now the menu seems to be just another Newport group resturant menu. That being said I will be back, hope they hear the menu concern.
April 27, 2013|My husband and I frequent|5|My husband and I frequent this restaurant not just for their amazing food, but especially for Bill, the server we request EVERY time. He makes our dining experience leisurely, pleasant and ALWAYS great.
April 27, 2013|Great Service and Food|4|They sat us right in front of the water-view glass, perfect! And the service was phenomenal, very caring and attentive. The options for food were all very tempting, we tried the Oysters Hemenway, Stuffed Steamed Lobster and the Seafood Boil. All were great dishes.

Our drinks were delicious (my husband tried an Old Fashioned for the first time and our server provided excellent assistance with helping him decide whether it was a good choice for him).The King Crab appetizer and oysters on the shell were amazing. As was the tuna tartar. We each really enjoyed our meals--swordfish, seafood paella, and the filet mignon. We all agreed that the Caesar salad was one of the best we'd all ever had. To top it all off, Catherine, our server, was phenomenal. We will definitely be back!
April 20, 2013|Great Service & So-So Seafood|3|We went to Hemenways to celebrate my husband's birthday and had low expectations from what we'd heard and experienced in the past. Our server. Steve immediately cheered us up and he was amazing for the remainder of the meal. We ordered the calamari to start and a dozen littlenecks. Both dishes were perfection- the calamari was done Rhode Island style with hot peppers...and very very fresh! Our chowders were a little packaged tasting- like definitely not made in house. My husband's salad with cold shell fish was also mediocre and the shellfish was not particularly fresh tasting. The meal was not overly impressive, but the service was!
April 20, 2013|Good for Food Allergies|5|Delicious food, friendly and attentive service. The clam chowder was outstanding. The waitstaff, manager and executive chef were appropriately attentive to my food allergies without being overbearing. The setting was beautiful - as we dined, we watched a gondola going back and forth along the river.

April 15, 2013|Good food, service lags on a Monday|3|This was our third time at Hemenway's in the last year or so and it has become one of our favorites. This occasion was a rare Monday nite out and we were surprised by the number of people at the restaurant. Apparently Hemenway's was surprised too as the service was way off. Our server all but disappeared on several occasions. Food took a long time and even the check was a tedious process. I do recommend Hemenway's based on the quality of the food and past experiences, but they are now on double secret probation.

We were greeted promptly and escorted to a romantic table overlooking the water. Our server was super nice and super attentive. Drinks were awesome. Pace was very unhurried. Steamers were ridiculously good. The George's Bank baked scallops were to to die for! The Paella was really good too. Our server provided us with a free dessert for our special night, and even presented it with a lit candle. We spent three hours in unhurried food bliss... I'm glad Hemenway's was a part of our special celebration!

March 31, 2013|Our service was outstanding|5|"Our service was outstanding in spite of the restaurant being very busy. All servings were timely and we did not feel rushed. The chef special of crab and lobster stuffed salmon melted in your mouth, it was delicious.The key lime ""pie"" for desert tasted more like key lime cheesecake, excellent."
March 30, 2013|We have always been impressed|5|We have always been impressed with the Newport Restaurant Group. I am gluten free and Hemenways catered to my needs with great gluten free dinner rolls, specially made Calamari and overall expertise on each dish inquired about and ordered.

March 22, 2013|Disappointed in Providence|2|"Was excited to go to Hemenway's. Have enjoyed some good meals there before. This night, I was accompanied by my wife and two daughters. We had oysters and shrimp from the raw bar, ordered a nice bottle of wine and waited for our meal. And we waited. And we waited. When the meals finally arrived, the tuna I ordered (which was ordered ""as rare as you can possibly prepare it"" was cooked through. Not red, not pink, but white. I sent it back. My wife and daughter shared their meals with me while I waited for my dish to come back from the kitchen. Their fish was ok, but overcooked. Nothing special. And it should be for what they charge for their entrees. This night, the meals were average, service was slow and price was too high."
March 22, 2013|Always a pleasure to eat here|4|Enjoyed our dinner here as always Since they updated the menu it has become one of our favorite places!
March 21, 2013|We chose Hemenway's through|5|We chose Hemenway's through a recommendation from our hotel concierge (Providence Biltmore). We wanted something that gave us a sense of the character of Providence and Rhode Island, since we were first-time visitors. We were not disappointed. The food was excellent, and our server was superb. We each got the two chef's specials that night and were so glad that we did. And the local oysters are some of the best we've ever had. We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Dined on March 21, 2013|A great way to end a busy day!|5|"Hemenway's is a downtown Providence favorite. Pleasant atmosphere, great service. We sat at the bar and it was totally enjoyable. Bartenders were on the ball and quick to attend to your needs. The food was ample and delicious. Great place for a business meeting, a casual drink or ""that special occasion"" and highly recommend. Parking is somewhat of a problem but valet parking is availalbe at a cost of $6 plus a tip (if so inclined). Parking is in the same building which makes it convenient."
March 17, 2013|Safe Gluten free dining|5|Hemenway's staff and chef were very helpful when my husband told them he needed a gluten-free meal. They do have a gluten free menu and that always lets us know they are aware of how the meal needs to be prepared and served. My husband asked a couple of questions and the chef came out to answer them. That is real service at it's best.
March 16, 2013|Great space and service|4|"When you want to go out to dinner with special people, Hemenway's is always a good bet. The space is dramatic and the view of downtown and the river during the daylight hours is quite wonderful. Service is always top notch and our server ""Bill"" was engaging, fun and professional. We have always found the food average. There were four of us on a very busy Saturday evening. We all ordered the Flounder special ($30) and it was okay but not great. Broccoli Rabe was cold (maybe that's the way it was supposed to be). We like to have dinner there, mainly due to the space and the service, but always go without great expectations on the food."
March 16, 2013|Disappointed in service -|3|Disappointed in service - ordered boiled 2 lb lobster and got baked stuffed at additional price because server kept saying it was their special. Manager said would adjust bill, but it was not adjusted when presented. First time ever had a problem here. Food is very good and that is why we return.

March 10, 2013|I had baked stuffed shrimp|3|I had baked stuffed shrimp and the shrimp was way overcooked - tough and rubbery. In addition, there was a vein in one of the shrimp so it was not even cleaned properly. Our first course of littlenecks and chorizo was very good.
March 10, 2013|Could have been better|3|The manhattan chowder was delicious. The seafood caesar salad was disappointingly ordinary - just cooked (boiled?), unseasoned seafood, put on a pile of romaine lettuce. The tea came in a pot which allows the tea to steep - very nice touch. The fried calamari was very good. My husband's Bloody Mary was not especially good - seemed watery. The rolls were ordinary.
March 9, 2013|terrible experience|1|Our table was tiny, the food was terrible, the service was terrible as well. The waitress never checked back after dinner was delivered so we didn't even have an opportunity to alert her. She never told us any specials, which I heard another waitress share with her tables. We been going here for years despite a 40 minute drive because we usually enjoy it so much, not sure if we will ever be back, things have changed.
March 9, 2013|I've been to Hemenway's many|2|I've been to Hemenway's many times and the other evening it missed the mark. The food was sub-par. Disappointed.
March 9, 2013|If you haven't been to Hemenway's|5|If you haven't been to Hemenway's in a while, you should try it again. The menu is fresh yet still has some of the long-time standards. And, all the food is good. Much of food is local sourced. So the good seafood that Hemenway's has had is no longer spoiled by those horrible salads they used to serve. Fresh, delicious food and wonderful service. Nice, grownup cocktail offerings, too along with good wine selections.

March 2, 2013|We started at the bar and|4|We started at the bar and moved to a table. Food was delicious and service was good.
March 2, 2013|Our experience started off|3|Our experience started off well. Our server was very knowledgeable in regards to the menu; she was able to answer several questions without hesitation, and was able to make excellent recommendations. Soon after we received our soup, a party of 14 was seated next to us. They also had the same server as us. Once they were seated, we saw our server once during the main entree and then one more time to take our dessert order. Other people brought out our main dish, took away our empty plates, and cashed out our ticket. Our original server did thank us and wished us a good night. We felt that the party of 14 took precedence over us, and that we were an afterthought to our server for the remainder of the evening. Our food was excellent!!
March 2, 2013|Have been to Hemenway's many|5|Have been to Hemenway's many times and am never disappointed. Food is always excellent, service wonderful. It cam be a little pricey, so I would save a visit for a special occasion.

March 1, 2013|We can't wait to go back!|4|We dined on a Friday night. Even though the restaurant was full, our request for a specific booth was honored. Our waitress Louise Burke was awesome in all aspects of serving us. We had a wonderful and relaxing experience. Oh, and did I mention the food, bisque, raw bar samplings, clams casino, lobster, steak and swordfish were generously portioned and tasted absolutely superb? We can't wait to go back!
March 1, 2013|good|4|We went when we were visiting providence. It got good ratings on open table. The food was very good but a little expensive. We will go back again when we are in the area.

February 25, 2013|Always Reliable and Enjoyable|4|Food is always good here with a variety of cooking options for almost very menu item offered. There is experienced mature service staff that understands how to sell rather than “take and order”. The booths are very tight for a larger person. Request a table by the window, there are many to choose from with great views.

Restaurant was out of mi first entree option even though we were the first table for dinner at 5:45.

February 16, 2013|Hemmingways has always been|3|Hemmingways has always been our favorite restaurant to experience excellent food, outstanding service and fantastic people watching, untill last Saturday. My reservation time was 7;45, we were seated promptly, but we were brought to the dark room waaay in the back, which, we had no idea even exsisted, had we known, i would have made sure we were in the main room. Seating is too cramped, and too invasive. Our meal was excellent as usual, but we had to order drinks, appys, main meal all at once, the usual relaxed atsmosphere lacked, seating poor, and i noted the menu changed. This was a different Hemmingways from May, when we were there last. I found on this night, the cost of this evening was not worth the effort.
February 16, 2013|From the moment we checked|5|From the moment we checked our car, checked in with the Hostess station and were sat to a tremendous waiter (David), the experience was just the perfect balance of formality and hospitality. Service was timely, knowledge of the menu supreme and overall emphasis on us was unheralded. The salads, soup/chowder and entres were exquisitely prepared and as described! Great wine list and wonderful bar for consumers of such plus they offered non-alcohol options for all others. This was dinner for our first anniversary and 'the house' hosted us to a glass of champagne;quite unexpected and further evidence of the spirit of 'we are here for you'! Ambiance/atmosphere were elegant, warm and romantic simultaneously. Truly a restaurant to return to.
February 15, 2013|Most tender, melt-in-your|4|Most tender, melt-in-your mouth scallops I've ever had! I also had the stuffed shrimp which were to die for! Amazing food!
February 15, 2013|First time at Hemenways and|4|First time at Hemenways and we were very impressed. Food was very good, restaurant was quite busy that night but we never felt neglected by our waitress. Our only complaint and this was probably due to how crowded it was (Valentine's Day) was we were seated by the bar which as people started waiting for their tables got quite crowded and we felt like we were being observed. Would definitely go back there though.
February 14, 2013|Great dining experience.|4|Fantastic food. Server was very knowledgeable. Noise level was perfect.
February 14, 2013|Went for Valentine's Day dinner.|5|Went for Valentine's Day dinner. Very courteous staff that was attentive and knowledgeable. Food was excellent and well prepared
February 14, 2013|everything was very good-seated|4|everything was very good-seated within 15 minutes of our reservation considering it was Valentine's day I was happily impressed-over all a great experience
Dined on February 14, 2013|Def. a repeat experience!|4|Despite it being Valentine's Day and therefore very crowded, the service was excellent and the kitchen kept pace, and the food was wonderful as usual. This is the best seafood house in Providence. Our reservation was for 7 and they were just a bit behind, but within 15 minutes we were seated and in the meantime we went ahead and ordered our bottle of wine at the bar (quickly served) and were mellow by the time we ordered dinner.
February 14, 2013|Not a place for Valentine's Day|2|1. Reservation for 7 p.m. Not seated until 7:20 p.m. 2. Waited on by two servers who initially were confused as to what the other may or may not have said or done. Strange. 3. House salad was notably unspectacular and rather pedestrian for an upscale restaurant. 4. Wine was requested with entree but served with salads. 5. Waited fifteen minutes for coffee following request after finishing entree. 6. The seating arrangement was very unpleasant. We were so close to diners on either side that we were able to hear their conversations. The tables were so close they may as well have been pushed together. I will not go to this restaurant again. What a waste of a lot of money.

February 2, 2013|Disappointed Times Four|2|We were looking forward to an excellent dinner, but were very disappointed. In a party of four, and everything to the bread to our entree was poor. Several of us got the Lobster Mac & Cheese zero flavor...it was a bit shocking with zero cheese flavor/not much lobster not to mention expensive $30/each. The house salad was iceberg lettuce...with such an upscale restaurant I think they could have upped the lettuce. Scallop/bacon app was not appetizing...bacon was fatty, scallop & bacon were not seared or browned in any way. Very disappointing from start to finish on food. Our waitress was lovely, restaurant looked inviting and interesting but those were the only good points. I was pass on this restaurant if good food is your calling.
February 2, 2013|Excellent seafood and great service|4|Dined on a busy Saturday night. We were seated right at the time of our reservation. Service was attentive and never rushed. Clam chowder seafood casserole, and swordfish were all excellent. Definitely one of the top places to go in Providence for fresh seafood cooked perfectly.

January 27, 2013|A wonderful experience|5|My boyfriend and I went to Hemenway's for our 4 year anniversary. We enjoyed ourselves so much we are going to make a tradition out of it. Upon confirming our reservation the hostess asked if it would be ok to decorate the table and of course I had no objection. When we sat down they had sprinkled it with fresh rose petals which I thought was a very nice touch. The food was spectacular the service was outstanding and the ambiance was classic, romantic, and tasteful. I highly recommend the shrimp and scallop ceviche as well as the seafood pasta. For dessert get the butterscotch cake. Its delicious! If you enjoy fresh flavorful seafood with great attentive service this is definitely the place for you. We will absolutely be going back soon.
January 26, 2013|Hemenways never lets us down.|5|Hemenways never lets us down. The food was delicious, the service excellent and the evening very enjoyable.
January 26, 2013|Great Food Bizarre service|4|"While the food was delicious the service was bizzare. Our waitress made very wierd rejoinders attempting to build rapport and converse with us but it came off very forced and wierd. She brought the wine after our appetizers were served, and then talked for about a minute until I finally rejoinded with ""Please pour the wine!"" Our lobster Bisque soup was cool and when I asked whether it was supposed to be cold she offered to warm it up to which I said no thank you. I ate out the lobster pieces and left the soup part. The manager did come over and took the soups off our bill after asking if we liked it so they did score some points for that. The topper was it was my birthday cake and in chocolate Happy Birthay! NO D LOL!!"

January 19, 2013|One of the best (year in/ year out)|4|Been here before and loved it and had the same experience several years later. One of the best spots for the freshest seafood in Providence served by great waiters and waitresses. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone who like a great meal.
January 19, 2013|Great seafood and great service!|5|I must say thoroughly impressed with the food and value, but above all our server Donn was outstanding! Best waiter we ever had! The seafood is always fresh and perfectly cooked. The 30 three course dinner special was a great added feature. If anyone has a complaint about our dinning experience was that it was a lil crowded. If you get a chance to eat in the anti room do so!
January 19, 2013|My first time Great food & service!|5|It was packed due to restaurant week in Providence, but service and food were great. I loved the special offered and the waiter was very helpful and pleasant. We look forward to dining again at this great place.

January 19, 2013|Best Restaurant Week Venue!|5|I went to Hemenway's for the first time during Providence Restaurant Week and the lunch menu exceeded my expectations. Hemenway's certainly does not skimp out on the quality of the food, despite the $14.95 steal that it offers for lunch unlike some other participating restaurants. I had the Seafood Broil and it is the best bang for your buck with seasoned root vegetables and tender scallops, salmon, and shrimp. I would have liked some greens with the entre but the overall dish was delicious. The dessert chocolate torte had a rich finish that melted in my mouth and rivals my favorite baked goods at Patische. In addition, the atmosphere was great and I highly recommend the restaurant as it most definitely lives up to its reputation!

For many years I have also made it a point to go in between shows and pass on to others of my great experiences there. I was very disappointed with the menu and food my last visit. Much less to choose from and nothing special or different from any other so-so place around. So sad to see this happen to this wonderful place. The staff was fabulous and the atmosphere wonderful,they need something special to sell. Unless it changes, I wont be back nor will I recommend.

She asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and brought us champagne for our anniversary. Overall, the meal was superb and service even better.
January 10, 2013|I have been to Hemenway's|5|I have been to Hemenway's on many occasions and i have never been disappointed. The food was fantastic and our service was excellent. I had a baked schrod that was fresh and well prepared. Two of my companions had the lobster mac and cheese (which I must confess I recently had myself) and it was excellent with a very generous portion of lobster. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great place to eat in Providence.
January 5, 2013|Maybe we are getting spoiled|3|Maybe we are getting spoiled by all the wonderful restaurants in Providence but our experience at Hemenways was good but not great. Atmosphere and service was wonderful. Shrimp cocktail and oysters were superb - wonderfully fresh. Entrees - scrod, bay scallops and regular scallops were mediocre and unimaginative.

December 31, 2012|We've been here before and|2|We've been here before and it's never disappointed until now. The service was terrible.. The waiter needed to be reminded of the things we asked for constantly (forgot the straw several times, messed up the drink order, didn't take my salad order until my partner's salad arrived, asked for no onions - got the onions in the salad, forgot the bread which arrived after salads and right before the main course, rare steak came out med-well so we had to wait for the second one to be cooked). Would not recommend the place based on our last experience as it was quite aggravating (what's he gonna mess up next?).

December 27, 2012|Great service, ok food|3|We enjoyed a quiet dinner at Hemenways. The restaurant was not especially busy so it was quiet and romantic. All of the staff and our service was outstanding; everyone was very knowledgeable, polite, and friendly. The food, however, was only ok. We had the antipasto plate appetizer which was very good. Our salads were ok, nothing too spectacular, though my husband was impressed by the quality of the vegetables. He ordered the NY Strip steak and found it to be very bland, slightly overcooked, and on the tough side. The meat just didn't seem of especially good quality. I had scallops with pumpkin ravioli. The scallops were excellent and perfectly cooked but the ravioli was too sweet.
December 27, 2012|A good choice for lunch|4|We have been to Hemenway's a number of times for dinner. We thought we would try it for lunch. We were given a lovely table by the windows that look out on the river. The lunch menu was varied and interesting. Our waiter was attentive. My only complaint is that it cost $6 to park in the lot next door. Dinner parking is validated, but lunch parking is only partially validated - this is what I was told.
December 26, 2012|Because I noted in my reservation|5|Because I noted in my reservation that I was gluten-free I was presented with a gluten-free menu without having to ask for one or explain anything. This was a first. It was the perfect introduction to an outstanding meal and excellent service. The oysters and lobster were fantastic.
December 24, 2012|Good but a pinch below expectation.|3|On balance food was good; scallop and clams casino appetizer and their chowder are top notch for example. Drinks were generously portioned. One of our party ordered the pork chop which was very dry; and the shrimp cocktail ( at 3.50 per piece) was not impressive in terms size or flavor, just average. I ordered the lobster, stuffed with shrimp and scallop: the waiter (who was quite attentive) suggested I order it 'fisherman's style' which is a 8 dollar surcharge to remove the meat from the claws—seemed inappropriate. I also wondered if I lost some of the volume of the tail to the 'stuffing.' Setting is lively and nice for families or special occasions.

December 22, 2012|Heminway's gets it|5|AS I do not eat red meat, I was disappointed that the chowder had pork in it. Other than that everything was excellent. We do not very often eat in a restaurant that we agree we would go to again. This one we definitely would!

December 10, 2012|Chelos style managers in a fine din|3|We went with a birthday group and tried to sit at the raw bar. The manager made such a big deal out of it. We could see him yelling at the server saying he could seat us and we would have to sit in the restaurant and have a sit down dinner which we didn't want to do. Eventually we got to sit and service was great!! The poor waiter who I felt bad for but was so wonderful with us. The manager made us feel as though we were a pain. Eventually when we did get some oysters and apps it was a good time. Our check was I believe around $800 so I hope the manager felt that was okay we knew we were going to drink and eat well we just prefer the bar and raw bar scene. I think he thought we were being cheap with not having a sit down dinner.

December 6, 2012|Another good meal!|5|As always, a great meal here. New menu since my last visit. We started with the Calamari and loved it! I had Mahi Mahi and my companions had: Swordfish, Rainbow Trout and Scallops. We asked that the Trout be served with the head removed and made some side dish substitutions and they complied with no problem. One person cut into her largest scallop and it didn't look cooked all the way through. She wasn't sure if it was that or the reflection of the red portion of a nearby neon light. But once she had it in her head - she couldn't shake it. She ate (and enjoyed) all the smaller scallops. When they were clearingthe plates, they noticed what she left, she explained and they removed the meal from the bill. Class place.

However, dressing on salad which came with the entree was a bit too much. I could only taste dressing but vegetables and seafood pasta was really spicy that my husband couldn't finish it. The lobster that I had was very good!
November 23, 2012|The Ultimate RI Seafood experience|5|Since both of our sons have moved away from RI, they always look forward to having really good seafood when they return. We took a group of 7 here the day after thanksgiving and it was fabulous . My husband and I have been here many times and our favorite is to go just for the cold seafood platter and their fabulous martinis. 5 out of our 7 ordered lobster and loved it. The others ordered lobster ravioli and also said it was fantastic. Plan to make this our annual post Thanksgiving dinner each year.

November 17, 2012|I have been going to Hemenway's|3|I have been going to Hemenway's since it opened. I have not eaten there in about a year. I was disappointed in how limited the menu has become. Very few choices for fish.
November 17, 2012|Hemenway's pays attention!|4|This was my first Open Table reservation and I wasn't sure how well the restaurant would react to special instructions etc. Hemenway's nailed it. They obviously read and paid attention to my special instructions and comments and did a great job. My wife and I had a great night at a good table with good food, friendly personal service and the kinds of details that make a good restaurant stand out against lesser establishments.
November 17, 2012|GREATTT Lobster!!!|5|Hemenway's was a great seafood restaurant in the heart of Providence, Rhode Island. My husband was there on business for the weekend and I tagged along, so for dinner on Saturday night, we treated ourselves. Our reservation was 6:45, we arrived at 6:40 and we were seated right away. The waitress recommended everything from the wine, to the appetizer to several different variations of lobster which is why we went there. Her recommendations were all excellent, including the portion size. I would definitely recommend Hemenway's and we intend to return next year when my husband travels back again.
November 16, 2012|First time there; convenient|4|First time there; convenient parking (which is HUGE plus for me). Delicious food, nicely presented, attentive service, reasonable cost.

We felt a little rushed at the beginning with appetizers and drinks, but everything went well after that. Lobster chowder was delicious, and the scallops with pumpkin ravioli was definitely very different and awesome. Lobster Mac and cheese was the only minor disappointment food wise, as we found it to be a little on the dry side. Overall, I would strongly recommend Hemenway's to anyone looking to try some legit local seafood.

He was not disappointed. We had a reservation for 4 but I was able to add a 5th shortly before our reserved time without any problem. The restaurant was busy but the waitstaff was superb and very timely in their service to us. Our server took the time to explain several dishes to us and was knowledgeable about how they were prepared and served. It was a fun and great experience for our first dinner at Hemenway's. We will recommend it to others."
November 13, 2012|No Lobster Bisque?|3|Henemway's has been my favourite restaurant for many years. I was surprised to see that the lunch menu had been reduced in size dramatically, offering fewer choices than previously. The other surprise was to discover that they no longer offer their lobster bisque. It has always been fabulous, and the substitute of lobster chowder wasn't very good. The soup was sort of a tomato-cream style with what looked and tasted like frozen peas and carrots. The lobster was so chewy and stringy that I had to use my knife (in the soup cup) to cut a piece in half. Very disappointing. I also noticed that the size of my favourite Jumbo Lump Crab Salad has gotten smaller. Still enough crab, but less lettuce. Very disappointing.
November 9, 2012|Love everything about Hemenway's.|5|Love everything about Hemenway's. Food quality, price, atmosphere, servers are excellent. We keep going back. Tonight we celebrated our 32 anniversary and the staff acknowledge that several times. Parking is next door convenient and enclosed.
November 6, 2012|Birthday dinner|5|I took my mother there for her 75 th birthday. Dian was our server. She was fantastic! The food was great! Can not wait to go back!
November 5, 2012|Although our overall experience|4|Although our overall experience was very good and our server was great our appatizer was overdone. Over-cooked scallops are never good and when there is bacon involoved that makes it even worse. Otherwise the Seafood pasta was great as well as the lobster ravioli. Try the seasonal Pumpkin Patch drink...very tasty!

Scrod was bland, a bit overlooked. Not tender at all. Clams Casino were nothing to rave about, could have come out of a frozen package as a comparison. Might be nice for a drink in nicer warmer weather
October 28, 2012|Usually at least 4 stars across|3|Usually at least 4 stars across the board, but we had a waitress that was a little too intrusive, offering opinions whan we weren't seeking them and overall too talkative. Eat at the bar when you can...the atmosphere and the service there is always tops.

The food was amazing, from beginning to end. The seafood was local and fresh, the dessert was nicely done, sweet but not to sweet. Over all I would highly recommend Hemenway's to anyone who enjoys a fine meal."
October 27, 2012|Disappointing|4|"We chose Hemenway's to celebrate my husband and daughter's birthdays. Danny was a good waiter. A little to quick on his feet at times and he set the tone that he knew best. After dinner, our coffee arrived and it took another 15 to 20 minutes for the children's ice cream to arrive. We then waited for our check at least 20 minutes with no glance our way. Our guests with children had to leave because the wait was so long. We sent someone to find Danny so we could get our check. When I asked if he applied the gift card, his response was ""Yes. Look right here (and pointed) it's a little thing called math."" We paid our $400+ bill and left insulted. This was completely unlike other experiences we have had at Hemenway's. What a shame!"
October 26, 2012|Excellent food, wonderful|5|Excellent food, wonderful service, would go again. The rose petals were a really nice touch. It took us 5 months to find a kid-less time to have our anniversary dinner and this place was fabulous.
October 23, 2012|Very nice, attractive place|4|"Very nice, attractive place with excellent service [the waiters sort of read from an unseen script, but they do it well]. Lobster and crab cakes were top-notch, great house salad, stuffed shrimp had tasty dressing but the shrimp themselves were kind of rubbery. However, you must have the ""smashed potatoes"" side dish -- a zillion calories probably but the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. Generous drinks, a little skimpy with the wine. Overall, a very pleasant experience."
October 20, 2012|3rd visit|5|Always awesome food and great service. A little pricy but well worth it for the food, service and atmosphere that comes with it. This is both mine and my fiancées favorite, which is why I chose this place to celebrate our engagement. She was not disappointed.

October 19, 2012|Uneven but worth another visit.|3|Artic Char had no flavor. Another entre was the paella which was really great. The last dish was also mahi mahi which was good. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was good but a little overcooked and didn't taste as fresh as expected. The service was very personable and we really enjoyed speaking and laughing with the waitress. We would come back to this restuarant in the future.

October 13, 2012|5-star repeat performance!|5|My wife and I always remembered having a wonderful dining experience at Hemenwey's many years ago while on business. Wanting to mark a special occasion we wanted to have a repeat performance. It didn't disappoint! We have a passion for good seafood, and the menu provided an excellent range of choices. The wine list was extensive including one of our favorites. To compliment our great meal with an attentive wait-staff, we had a great desert and after dinner drink. Situated in the downtown area, we found the atmosphere as we remembered it. We wanted a table close to the window for the view, and it was ready for us, on time, thanks to our reservation over the Internet. Nothing went wrong, and we will return again!

We got assigned a table that had a cool breeze so we sat over at a high top in raw bar section, there were no other tables they could seat us at...I guess we didnt need to make a reservation after all. We got my husband a bar stool with a back, but I sat on a bar stool with no back...not so comfortable. I had to ask for bread and it took a while to get our drinks. Not the perfect evening I had planned but the food was delicious.

I am not an avid computer user so I was a little skeptical about making a reservation this way but I am a believer now. The restaurant was terrific! We were greeted by friendly staff and seated at a table with a great view as I had requested because it was our 16th wedding anniversary. The rose petals on the table were a nice touch along with the glass of champagne and impressed my wife. Our waitress was excellent; attentive but not smothering. The food was the best we've had dining out in some time. Our meal was not rushed. The swordfish & salmon were tender and perfectly cooked. We'll definitely be back.

October 6, 2012|My favorite seafood restaurant|5|My favorite seafood restaurant when visiting Providence, which my wife and I do 2 to 3 times a year. We especially like visiting in the fall for the last “Water Fire” festival. Hemenway’s is located right at the start of the festival and when we walk the whole event along the river we are back at our hotel across from the Providence Place mall. So, great food and a great location.
October 6, 2012|My favorite restaurant|5|We eat at Hemenway's every time we travel to Providence. I don't know of a restaurant anywhere that I love more. The food is mouthwatering. The menu is amazing. I love just being there. A special occasion atmosphere that makes you always feel elegant and cozy at the same time. Never take the Portuguese Grilled Little Necks off your menu. Great wine list. Even on one of what must be the most crowded night of the year (paren't weekend, waterfire, etc), the pace in the restaurant feels excited but relaxed. I never feel rushed. The staff has made an effort to fit me in or adjust my reservation when possible. What a perfect place!

September 29, 2012|Four of us gathered for lunch|4|Four of us gathered for lunch at Hemenways. We started with the seafood sampler appetizer. The calimari and scallops wrapped in bacon were very good, the clams casino were close to inedible, overcooked and rubbery. For main courses we had, the fish tacos (which were dry and tasteless), the lobster BLT, shrimp scampi and the lobster ravioli...all with great reviews. Finally for dessert we shared the chocolate cake which was delicious, moist, chocolatey, to die for. All in all, we would definitely go again, but would stick to more traditional seafood fare.
September 28, 2012|Favorite Restaurant|5|This has become our favorite seafood restaurant in the area. The staff is professional from the time we enter till we leave.

September 28, 2012|One of the best places for|4|One of the best places for seafood in all of New England. Sit at the bar for great conversations with the staff and the regulars (of which I am gradually becoming). Everything from the raw bar is great, as are all the appetizers. The simpler entrees are best. I'm not a fan of the recent trend of restaurants of adding some kind of fruit topping to fish (e.g., banana aioli or roasted strawberries), but if you fancy that, I'm sure Hemenway's does it well.
September 26, 2012|insufferable wait staff|3|"This could be a wonderful restaurant, but the wait staff treat diners like toddlers who have never been to a restaurant before. It""s bad enough to have a waiter introduce himself by name, and explain that he or she will 'be taking care of you."" But the explanation of the menu that customers are holding is insufferable. I am embarrassed to take out-of town friends to this restaurant, which is too bad, because the food, the ambiance, the vibe are all quite nice."

The waitstaff was very knowledeable of the items on the menu and service was first class. All of our menu selections were excellent and the portions were just right. The desserts followed suit as well. The right size for tasting and sharing without over-stuffing yourself. It had been sometime since I last visited this restaurant and the quality is still there. My next visit won't be far away.
September 15, 2012|Excellence every time|5|We make sure to have dinner at Hemenway's whenever we're in the Providence area because the food and service are always excellent. This visit was no exception to that rule. Around the table we had pork tenderloin that was succulent and fork tender, a paella that included a wealth of fresh and delicious seafood, huge tender scallops that were a virtual melt-in-your-mouth experience and the most flavorful baked stuffed shrimp ever. The dining experience was topped off by the attentive and entertaining service rendered by our waiter, Danny.

September 8, 2012|Great visit|5|Dined at Hemenway's for our 20th Wedding Anniversary. Our server made it very special. Food was great. Great view of the river, although it was pouring rain. Complimentary dessert was a nice touch.
September 7, 2012|Server was fun. The delay|2|Server was fun. The delay between dishes we believe was due to the kitchen. Food was less than expected. Lobster Mac n Cheese, which promises a whole lobster, fell short on taste and lobster. Overall a less than expected experience, after such great reviews.
September 7, 2012|A Hodgepodge of Fresh Seafood|4|Even though Hemenways is a seafood restaurant, I was astonished at the variety of fish and shellfish offered on the menu. When we ordered raw oysters, we were given a choice of three different types. I guess when you have that many varieties, it's hard to make everything exceptionally well, so although we were all satisfied with the dinner, none of us thought that the food was superb. Everything was fresh and quite tasty, but we didn't finish a single item we ordered (which, for our family, means that we just didn't love it enough to suffer the consequences of eating the whole thing). Nothing was bad or disappointing. It was all just good. The service was, however, absolutely wonderful, albeit maybe a bit slow, but we weren't in any hurry!
Dined on September 7, 2012|Hemingway|4|Seafood was very good, Hemingway Oysters I would recommend. Pricing a tad on the high side, ambience was nice and the server was great!

September 2, 2012|We always go the Hemenway's|3|We always go the Hemenway's when we are in town. This time the restaurant was extremely busy. We had a 7:30 pm reservation and were seated a few minutes past that time. The service (not the waitress but the kitchen) was extremely slow. By the time we got our entrees, it was about 9:00 PM! However, by that time our appetites were diminished and we were no longer hungry. I spoke to the manager and the bill was reduced to partially compensate for the delays.
September 2, 2012|The service was incredibly|3|The service was incredibly slow. While this appears to have been the fault of the kitchen, there was no acknowledgement of the delay and/or apology from the servers. Dinner took 2.5 hours overall (appetizers and entrees, no dessert).
September 2, 2012|We ordered the paella and|5|We ordered the paella and it was delicious. It had just the right combination of rice and seafood. The service was flawless. We were a group of 7 and sometimes the service gets a little disjointed with a large table, but our waitress kept right up with it. I have dined here a few times a year for the past 5 years, this was our best meal yet.
September 2, 2012|You will keep coming back|5|Have dined at Hemenways for years, and the seafood, preparation, and service is always of a consistent high quality. Valket parking setup with attached garage is very convenient in any weather.
September 1, 2012|Took my girlfriend out for|5|Took my girlfriend out for her 35th birthday and she loved it. She had the stuff lobster and said it was amazing. I had the New York Strip, thought it was good but wished it had more seasoning found it a bit bland, but the stuffed shrimp was amazing. When we first got there around 9pm it was a bit loud for me but that's because it was busy...as it got a bit later and less crowded it was quieter. We got an amazing table looking out on the water which was perfect. We took dessert home for later and it is probably some of the best dessert I have ever had. We had the chocolate cake with espresso sauce and the cheesecake. I would definitely go back but would stick with the seafood next time...our server was David and he was great!
September 1, 2012|Our first time there. It was|5|"Our first time there. It was truly one our best memories. Being so busy the waiter still managed to make us feel special and attended to. A great flow from the bar to the seating was a plus. THe food overall was excellent and food portion was generous. The lobster was on the dry side and I thought $5.00-$7.00 higher than expected. it was probably due to the volume of traffic. As for ambience it seemed that the owners tried to mix some local charm with cosmopolitan feel. It detracts slightly from your professional staff doing such a great job. To finish the rose petals and window view really made our night. You know the saying ""Happy wife makes a happy life."""
September 1, 2012|Overall it was a very nice|4|Overall it was a very nice meal,although a little over-priced given the unimaginative menu. The decor is lovely and the view is very nice. I had the scallops with porcini mushroom ravioli. The scallops were perfectly cooked and nicely browned and the ravioli were tasty. My husband had the lobster ravioli and our son had the halibut. They both enjoyed their entrees, but didn't think they were in any way special. The desserts were just ok, nothing at all interesting and not particularly well prepared. The crust on the berry pie was completely soggy and inedible, but the berry filling was tasty.
September 1, 2012|First time at Hemenway's -|3|First time at Hemenway's - I've heard great things about it but was a little disappointed with the food. It was good, just not as GREAT as I imagined it would be. What they lacked in taste, they made up for in service. I'll give it one more try.

Yes it is a ""tourist"" location and does not have the charm of the bistro's on the riverfront. The seafood is always good and the service always friendly. We find it comfortable and go there on most of our visits to Providence."
August 25, 2012|A wonderful high end seafood|5|A wonderful high end seafood restaurant overlooking the canal. The evening's special of lobster & crab cakes were the best we've ever had. They had a strong lobster flavor, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Our waitress was friendly, attentive and gave us just the right amount of time with each course so that we could comfortably socialize with our guests. We'll definitely return to this gem!
August 23, 2012|Our Special Day|5|I have reviewed Hemenways before and my review has not changed. I only go to this restraunt for special occasions and this one was very special: I was asking the love of my life to marry me on a Gondola after dinner. Our regular waiter Bill was so exited that he had us come back after the proposal to congratulate my girl. The manager gave us complimentary wine and Bill thanked us for including him on our special day. If you want a delicious meal and great service go to Hemenways. If you want the greatest service professional in the industry: ask for Bill.

August 18, 2012|Hemeway's was perfect for|5|Hemeway's was perfect for a late-night Saturday dinner. The full menu was available (unlike many spots that have late-night dining with shockingly limited menus.) Basil Lime Gimlet, hendrick's style, perfection in a glass. The Calamari, Kung pao style, was amazing. Not too sweet, very different than any other calamri I have had. The texture was just right and the flavor was incredible. For an entree I had simply grilled tuna, rare, cold in the center and smashed potatoes. The tuna was the correct temperature, the texture was spot on, it was a delicious piece of tuna. Clearly a quality cut of fish. The potatoes.... What can I say? No one can beat Hemenway's! If you are looking for a fantastic dinner, go to Hemenway's.
August 18, 2012|A special restaurant in Providence|5|This is a special restaurant. The food was so well prepared and interesting for our first night in Providence during Waterfire night. We started with a tasty clam appetizer. The lobster prepared fisherman style was an enormous treat - bring your appetite. The swordfish my wife had was tasty and expertly prepared. Enjoyed the lively atmosphere. This was a great place to be.
August 18, 2012|Disappointed|2|I have been to Hemenways several times and have had mostly good experiences. This visit was disappointing. The food was good but the service was terrible. The waitress was inattentive and disappeared for 1/2 hour more than once. It took us over two hours to finish and we did not have dessert.
August 18, 2012|It was truly a wonderful dining|5|It was truly a wonderful dining experience. We went there with another couple who actually recommended the restaurant and all of our meals were superb! Unfortunately, we had requested a table by the window which was not available to us, however, I would try to call earlier to have that particular seat, it looked like it was well worth the wait.

We believe that booking online several weeks in advance got us a perfect table and no wait. Once at that table, the service could not have been better...our waitstaff nicer or more accommodating. And, the food was superb. Our guests felt it was the best seafood restaurant they had ever been to and we all enjoyed our evening immensely. We will return and we will recommend Hemenway's to others. Excellent!
August 18, 2012|No waterfire view!|4|Overall we were very satisfied, however Hemmingways boasts their view of waterfire and though we had a window table the actual waterfire was on the other side of the bridge and out of view. Misleading to say the least!!!

August 17, 2012|Hoped for the best, but..........|2|We read mixed reviews for this restaurant and decided to take a chance anyway. Our visit was an early Friday night dinner for 4 and we were seated overlooking the river (very nice). The atmosphere was pleasant although somewhat noisy. Our waitress was very friendly however the service seemed to decline noticably as the night went on. The appetizers were tastey however our main fish courses were very dissapointing, cold and tough. I'm sorry to have to say that this restaurant is overpriced for the dining experience.

August 7, 2012|Excellent service and food.|5|Excellent service and food. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The lobster was very sweet and delicious but I wouldn't put the topping on for the crab was mild so did not have much taste and although the scallops were good, I would rather have had them separately on another occasion. Baking, even though minute, did dry some parts a little thus I would not choose having it this way. The ceviche was delicious but I prefer when it is chopped and has more tomatoes and onion chopped with it. However the sauce was perfect. The scallop dish was excellent.

She was not especially attentive and we felt like we we had to jump on her if she ever walked by since she was hard to track down. At the end of the day, we hate feeling guilty to ask for things or for more drinks before our current drink is done because we don't know when the she will be back. It is a popular place so I guess so-so service is just the consequence of a busy restaurant. We actually still highly recommend it to everyone, just maintain expectations on service..the food is delicious and well worth it.

The only downside of the experience....and it was a HUGE downside....was that the restaurant was extremely hot! It was so hot, the opportunity to truly enjoy the dining experience was ruined. You know when the ice in your water quickly melts and your wine glass is sweating profusely....and so are you and your dining companion.....it is too hot! The service was lovely and the wait person was very apologetic about the uncomfortable temperature, but I would not return when temperatures are high.

The New England style clam chowder was fantastically thick and creamy, the scallops were perfectly cooked, the surf and turf was to die for, and the white chocolate mousse was so delicious that I forgot that I tend to dislike white chocolate.

The server was knowledgeable, attentive and was always pleased to hear we were enjoying our wine selection, appetizer, entrees and dessert. We arrived at 6p and found the restaraunt very quiet. However, as we continued on with our meal, the tables filled up and became quite busy, the noise was moderate, but did not distract from the personal table conversation we were having. We have eaten at several of the Newport Harbor Corporation Restaraunts and view Hemenways as on par with the high quality and service expected from this level of dining. Only recommendation would be to add a soft musical selection to add to the ambiance of the dining room.

The plating is even nice, the only problem is the very slow service and difficulty even finding the server.

Being in the food industry for over 15 years now, I can be a picky person to please in a restaurant. Hemenway's has not let me down yet and I have a feeling that they are not going to, either!

If the restaurant needs to charge a little more to increase portions they should. Positives about the restaurant include good service and a nice view of the Providence River.
June 2, 2012|Incredible First Experience|5|I booked a reservation here for my wife's college graduation dinner. It was just the two of us, but I wanted to make it very special for her considering the hard work she had put into her education. The staff was incredible, because I had to switch my reservation at the last minute due to the graduation ending much earlier than we anticipated. The staff there accomodated us with no questions asked. I also had flowers ordered to be delivered to the restaurant as another surprise. Due to the rescheduling, the flowers hadn't arrived yet when we got there, but again the staff went the extra mile and put rose petals on the table to hold us over until the flowers eventually did arrive. The food was amazing as well.
May 27, 2012|Best Ever|5|I have been in the industry for over 15 years and Hemenway's is the only restaurant I would like to duplicate and make a restaurant of my own!!!

I visited with my mom (turning seventy in a week) and my aunt turning 79 in three weeks) and between the three of us we have never had such a terrific waitress. Diane was phenomenal, attentive, kind, and warm. She knew exactly what we needed before we even needed it. She took such terrific care of my mom and aunt, it actually brought tears to my eyes. She made them feel special! The food was excellent, my mom had the Paella which she said was sensational and my Aunt and I enjoyed the lobster. Their birthday slice of cake was beyond yummy! I would highly recommend experiencing this restaurant. Time it right during the summer and you can step right outside following a delicious meal and enjoy Water Fire!

Standard fare at above standard prices, crowded seating, and no valet parking (really, in this day and age!). Hemenway's had a distinct ""chain"" feel, as if I'd eaten there before...very similar to McCormick & Schmick's, or Mitchell's - only with a higher price tag. All-in-all, I can't say I'd rush to visit again."

My only beef was not pleased with my trout dish - it was wrapped proscutto (sic) over powered the trout which was delicious. Waitress was great. Always like my food in past so maybe it was just this dish. Other guests enjoyed their meals.

Probably would have been smart to some kind of recovery that day or in the days after. I'll be back but if it happens again I'll squawk and I won't eat there prime time. Think about my recommendation going forward?

Had our 6 year old with us and she loves to walk arround the area after dinner. They had Porter House Oyster Stout on the beer list which I had in Dublin ten years ago- never thought I'd find it in the States much less here in RI.

May 11, 2012|Great seafood restaurant|4|Overall a great place to eat. Food and service are great. Ambiance is more lively and brighter than other top-notch restaurants, which is good since I like to sometimes see what I'm eating. It's not the best seafood restaurant, but it's definitely one of the better ones in Providence. I would definitely return here again.

Service variable - we had a friendly but slow server this past Saturday evening - had to wait 20 minutes before getting water, giving drink order, etc. Still, we had a great dinner (loved the Oysters Hemenway appetizer) and a very enjoyable evening.

April 28, 2012|Memorabel Evening!|5|My wife and I and best friends came to Hemmingways to celebrate our 25th and their 15th wedding anniversary. The service, food and drinks were outstanding as it always has been in all our past visits. Not only did they accomodate our reservation request for a table on the window view side, our waiter Bill was awesome! His professionalism, personality and attention to our table was fantastic. And then when we thought we were ready for desert, low and behold Bill came to our table with a Happy Anniversary Wish and a slice of Cheescake and chocolate cake with exquisite presentation and taste on behalf of Hemmingways. Thanks Hemmingways for making our Wedding aniversary celebration a fun and memorable evening. Be back real soon. Cheers!

April 21, 2012|Not Good|1|My 1st time experience at Hemenway's was horrible. The shrimp scampi dish needs a lot of work, it was garbage. The pasta was too thick and tasted chalky, shrimp was cooked in the microwave because it was like chewing gum and the scampi sauce tasted like medicine. The service was very slow and unfriendly, except for the 2 managers. My sorority selected this place as an alternate dining place because our regional conference was being held nearby and I must say it was terrible decision. Our pre-elected menu items were paid for in advance (including the gratuity) and we got robbed blind. The waiters and waitresses only catered to the regular customers. I do not recommend this place and will never be a returning customer.

Our Server, Dan, was spot on from start to finish and really helped make the evening so special. His wine choices were spot on. He truly knows his stuff and is an exceptional waiter. I will definitely be asking for him when we return. We started with a bunch of items from the raw bar (1/2 off on Mondays!) and the oysters were out of this world (we ordered 12 more!).

March 23, 2012|One of Providence's Best|5|There is first-come seating at the bar, but make a reservation to avoid the wait. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and were seated right away. Our booth was up high on the bar level and had a decent view of the river, though I don't think there's a bad seat in the house. The waitstaff was prompt and attentive, the menu offerings enticing, and our selections prepared beautifully. They do salmon and lobster particularly well and their specials are usually fantastic. Take advantage of the valet service in the parking garage right next door, and Hemenway's will validate your ticket. This is one of my wife's and my favorite restaurants in Rhode Island, and we'll be back soon!
March 21, 2012|Consistently Good; Responsive Staff|5|Hemenway's is consistently good, and this is the essence of its long-term viability and success among the fickle Providence restaurant scene.The waitstaff is exceptional - I believe Diane was the name of the waitress that took care of our business-meeting party. She was very professional, knowledgeable, and responsive. The food was prepared perfectly, and served very quickly. Wine list is exceptional and they go out of their way with things other restaurants miss - details - to keep the water glasses full, validate parking and keep you aware of special offerings that day or night.Our guest was in from Florida and was very impressed.

We prefered to wait and found two seats at the bar. We asked for a window seat if possible. They were not able to accomodate that request, however we were seated in a booth across the room. Our table did not end up being ready until almost 8:10PM. Understanding that it was a Saturday night and the restaurant got busy very fast.. we were okay with the timing. the food was fantastic.

However, our server was excellent and the kitchen/chef kindly adjusted one of our orders by making it vegetarian, which I know on a busy night isn't easy. (It was delicious!) So, a mixed experience, but we'd go back.

February 13, 2012|Outstanding food and Great Service|5|My Boyfriend and I went to Hemmngways for Valentines day. It was our first time there and our server, David was very helpful in suggesting wine and food pairings. Everything on the menu sounds so good you will have a hard time choosing what you want for dinner....and that definitely happened to us because we didnt place our orders until after we finished our appetizers. We wanted a nice relaxing romantic night and thats exactly what we got! We didn't feel rushed by David at all even though we could tel the restaurant was getting pretty busy half way through our meal. All in all an absolutely wonderful experience. We will be back!

No privacy or much room to pass between them. Better idea would be to not pack so many tables on the floor, it makes for an unpleasant dining experience

February 11, 2012|Good food but I've had better|4|The clams casino lacked seasoning. They were lacking in flavor also. The head chef should really consider revamping the recipe. The lobser and crab cakes are EXCELLENT. My entree was decent I had the scrod with crab stuffing and scallops. Again it lacked flavor, not enough crab on the scrod. Wine was great. I would go there again.

Unfortunately, in the corner table located directly behind us were two mothers and their young sons. I could not carry on a conversation after their arrival due to their decibel level and was extremely disappointed. Waiter knew these people and spent most of his time with them taking photos with the kids, talking about life, etc. Really disappointed with ambiance.

January 28, 2012|Hemenway's was a joy!|5|We were there for Restaurant week. The prix fixe menu choices were excellent - the portions were more than ample. They were extremely accommodating - we had a large group and they were more than willing to provide us with separate checks. Food was excellent, service was excellent... a terrific experience.
January 28, 2012|I recently participated in|3|I recently participated in Prov Restaurant January weeks. The selections on the prefix menu for lunch looked wonderful but when the meal arrived I was underwhelmed. While the dessert was outstanding, the soup and entree were at best boring; the vegetable side was a confusing masss of texture and flavor. On the plus side our waiter was very attentive and helpful & the room and decor were lovely.
January 27, 2012|Our waitress gave us a great|5|Our waitress gave us a great wine suggestion. Service was very fast considering it was a Friday night during restaurant week. Did not feel rushed though. We were seated in the back room which was still nice/elegant but we were in the corner under a bright pot-light which was the only detail I would change about the experience. Reasonable prices too.
January 27, 2012|The service was good, not|4|The service was good, not great. The waiter was knowledgeable but not as personable as we would normally expect. We were seated in an area with a great view of the city. We were surprised to see so many other customers that were dressed in jeans and flannel shirts, didn't expect that. The noise was a bit more than resturants of this caliber usually are making the ambience less than expected. The appetizer, meal, and desert was very good. It was hot and well timed. Overall a good experience and would go back to try it again.

January 23, 2012|I was meeting an old college|4|I was meeting an old college friend for lunch halfway between Newport and Boston and Hemenway's seemed like the ideal spot. I've never been disappointed with the food in other restaurants of the Group, Castle Hill, The Moorings, 22 Bowens so my expectations were high. I ordered a seafood dish,salmon shrimp, scallops. It was dried out, overcooked, and less flavorful than an fast food fish sandwich. The cook should take a refresher course at J&W or spend sometime in the Castle Hill kitchen. There is stiff competition between Providence restaurants so don't waste your time here. I'll never go back . If they continue to serve food like the lunch serve to me it will get a lot quieter. The service was excellent and saved the experience.
January 22, 2012|It was not a good night for|3|It was not a good night for Hemenway's which is VERY unusual. Sunday night at 8:00pm was our reservation. Cold chowder with no clams, re-fried clams, nuked rolls - incredibly shocking for Hemenway's.

I came in for restaurant week and the restaurant week choices were lame. I didn't feel as if I got my money worth. I would look for their restaurant week menu if I were anyone else. My server was excellent!

I have recently taken groups of 20 to 25 people there, and the food is good, atmosphere is nice, and service is usually very good. But this time it was not the case. Not sure if it was because of Restaurant Week, but the service was delayed, made mistakes with the order, and the food was less than enjoyable. A disappointing dinner. Unfortunately I was entertaining a guest from Europe, so it was a bit disappointing to show this level of service from a fine U.S. Restaurant. Waitress repeatedly apologized, but it never got better.
January 14, 2012|Hemenway's is a great spot|5|Hemenway's is a great spot for that special occasion without breaking the bank. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you receive as well as the attention from the servers. The view is very nice and would be one of the prime spots to dine during full Waterfire events (when the event extends to this part of the river). Both my wife and I had the baked George's Bank scallops and they were prepared perfectly and some of the best we've had recently.

One small issue was cleared up quickly, my dinner reservation requested a window seat and we were seated at a table directly in front of the kitchen. Even though it was New year's Eve and crowded, I noticed a few open tables next to the windows in our dining area and the ""River Room"". I spoke to the Hostess and she immediately placed us at a window seat table. My advice would be that when Hemenway's calls you to confirm your reservation, you should remind them of your reservation request. Aside from that, our waiter was fantastic (Mike) and our food was cooked precisley to our request."

Our meal arrived out of order- soup and salad before the appetizer and wine after the salad. The calimari appetizer was disappointing.

I had the fried fisherman's platter, it comes with clams, scallops, shrimp and fish. The whole bellied clams were so good. The scallops were sweet and big. The shrimp were good and the fish was ok. Probably because everything else was so good it made the fish seem run of the mill. Only issue was the tartar sauce was odd, i was not a fan.

I had not been to Hemenway's in a number of years, so was hoping it was still a good place to choose...and I wasn't disappointed. My table was ready, and they made note of the fact that my colleague was 6'7"" and gave us a table with comfortable space. Our server Bill did a great job of describing the day's specials and highlighting things on the menu since we hadn't been there in a while."

Any restaurant can have a bad day, and I feel comfortable in saying that Hemenway's is still worth trying.
October 28, 2011|Excellent!!|5|My husband and I went to Hemenway's for the first time last week after a recommendation from our neighbors. The food and service was excellent. I had the halibut with mushrooms over a bed of pine nut rice pilaf. The halibut was very thick and cooked perfectly...absolutely delicious! My husband had the 2 pound lobster stuffed with scallop and crab stuffing. His meal was pricy at $60, but it was sooo good! We also started off with the lobster ravioli appetizer....again, no complaints here. We will definitely return.

We had a reservation and even though there were roomier tables available in the dining room, four men were squeezed into a booth adjacent to the bar. Our waiter was adequate but not the most observant or attentive. I often order the crab/lobster appetizer as an entree and did so again this night. Although usually delicious, this night they were mostly bread crumbs, very little lobster and I could not find any crab. I was with business guests and didn't want to create an uncomfortable situation so I did not complain. I hope this experience is not an indication of where the restaurant is heading...

October 20, 2011|The Shellfish Tower is awesome|5|"I take my clients and friends to Hemenway's because the food is *always* fresh and delicious and the service is attentive but not intrusive. Don't be fooled into ordering the so-called Grand Shellfish Platter -- it's good but it's just a single plate of shellfish. Smart money is on the frequently overlooked ""Shellfish Tower"" an amazing double-decker feast which is buried in the middle of the seafood box on the menu with no adjective. If the platter o' shellfish can be called ""grand"" then the tower of shellfish needs to be called ""stupendous"" or ""ginormous"" or something worthy like that."
October 19, 2011|I thought the food was just|3|"I thought the food was just good - maybe better than good, but did not justify the prices. The hostess did not make us feel valued as we waited for a table - we did have a reservation, and, after asking us for the name in which the reservation was made and telling us she could seat us at a ""small table or shortly in the bar,"" she just let us stand around near the front door for about five minutes. The waitress, on the other hand, was very good. Overall, I did not think Hemenways was a good value - that is I did not think the food, service, and ambience justified the prices."
October 15, 2011|The restaurant was great.|5|The restaurant was great. The lobster was fantastic! The food was delicious and the servers were very helpful. A little loud for our taste, but that is probably because the place was packed.

The food is terrific and the service is excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion.
September 24, 2011|Thank You Hemenways!|5|I go to Hemenways for special occasions... Birthdays, valentines day, etc. Every single time I have gone I have got nothing but top quality service, excellent food, and great drinks! This is by far my favorite place to go! If you haven't tried it yet, please go and do yourself a favor! It's a little pricy but definitely worth every penny!

The Point Judith Flounder dish was excellent in terms of flavor but the flounder was a tad overcooked. Calamari app was great. Ceasar salad was adequate but not anything special. I will go again and would recommend it. On balance it is a good spot.

September 10, 2011|noise level a major drawback|4|Nice view for Waterfire. Food was good although a bit pricey. Service was very good. Noise level was very unpleasant but masked the fact that small children at the next table were screaming at each other. They were pretty much drowned out by the overall noise level in the room.
September 10, 2011|FABULOUS FOOD, SERVICE & AMBIENCE|5|Wonderful restaurant, excellent food. Can't say enough about the service as well, Catherine (Cat) and Lana were terrific.

August 26, 2011|Best Seafood in RI!|5|Hemenway's is a Rhode Island treasure. Not only do I eat here with my local friends, I also recommend it for my out of town clients and family. Every person has always come back and said it was one of the best meals they have ever had. The service is fantastic and the seafood is so fresh.The crab & lobster cakes and calarmari are a meal alone and great to share with friends. Be sure to ask about the specials. There is always something special on the menu to enjoy!

Our experience was wonderful; it was our 23rd wedding anniversary and everything was well taken care of. The entire staff was very nice, our waitress Louise was Awesome; she took care of everything for the evening.

I had the special of the day which was a swordfish dish that was very good, but my dinner companions had a poor shrimp scampi and an adequate lobster ravioli.

August 8, 2011|Fine, not great|3|Provides a good range of seafood in various preparations (plain to reasonably creative). Quality is fine but created no 'wow' reactions in our party and does not meet the expectation created by the high pricing. The atmosphere, too, is louder and more informal than the restaurant's reputation and self-portrayal would suggest. If you want many choices of seafood, even in the off-season, this is a fine place. But in the summer most good restaurants in RI have great seafood selections, and there are many better (and cheaper) restaurants in Providence than Hemenway's.
August 6, 2011|Our party of four enjoyed|5|Our party of four enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Hemenway's on Saturday evening. The striped bass special was, indeed, special. The ceviche elevated the dish a notch and was a very nice touch.

It was lovely and I loved that the restaurant had family groups as well as business diners and handled everyone the same way. Our waiter had great suggestions for food and wine and we loved it all:) Can't wait to visit Providence again and eat here...
August 4, 2011|Good but not Great|3|We were there on a nice summer day. Nice spot outdoors. Service was great and food was good.

I hadn't been in Providence in a while and was surprised to see they are still in business! It's as good as Boston seafood eateries, but at least 20 percent cheaper. The special Halibut was out of this world. I hope they stay in biz for another 25 years!

July 17, 2011|Disappointed return|3|"I recently dined for the fourth time at Hemenway's and had a disappointing evening. Outside of the still fantastic Caesar Salad, the dishes I and my companion ordered were all bland, or a combination of over- and under-cooked items. Undercooked Asparagus, over cooked Salmon, ""ranch"" style blue cheese without any flavor, bland and thin bacon-corn chowder with the flounder. Prior visits had left me quite happy with the Cioppino, Caesar Salad, and calamari."

Unfortunately our food was pretty awful. My entree was so salty that I couldn't even eat most of it (and yes, I like salt). My teenage son will eat almost anything, and even his food went largely untouched. Also he ordered a bowl of clam chowder that was never delivered. The bread and salads were good.

June 4, 2011|My husband ordered the monkfish|3|My husband ordered the monkfish which is served in a simple lobster broth w/ diced red potatoes. The portion of fish was decent but for the price I would have expected at least more potatoes. It was bland overall.I ordered the baked stuffed lobster which had scallops and crab meat.The lobster was overcooked unfortunately but it was lobster so it still tasted good. I couldnt help but think about the lobster roll I had recently that was a 1/4 of the price and cooked much better. I was really dissapointed with the lobster, at 60 dollars all I ask is for the lobster to be cooked well.The side I chose was the parmesan vegetable risotto which was far from a risotto,it was more like a pilaf.The 3rd star is for dessert. Not a place for real foodies

May 21, 2011|Disappointing!|3|We had heard good things about Hemenway's so I booked it for a graduation luncheon. I ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese and it was on the small size but what bothered me most was that there were only 2 rather small pieces of lobster in it. For $30 it was outrageous. The mac & cheese wasn't anything that special either. Two others with us got a special of 3 stuffed shrimp and a lamb chop. It wasn't a typical looking chop and it was very small and mostly all bone. The meat was supposed to be cooked medium and it was more like rare. There was such long waits in between each part of the lunch (apps/salad/meal) that we didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait any longer. I've been to other restaurants in Prov. that were far better.

May 13, 2011|This was the first time dining|5|This was the first time dining at Hemmingways even though we grew up in Rhode Island. We were looking for a great seafood place and we found it. Our server Tom was great and really set us up for a good meal. He suggested the 5lb stuffed lobster for the two of us and we loved it. He also suggested a beer (I dont remember the name) that was like a blue moon and that was also great.
April 30, 2011|She loved the tuna salad and|4|She loved the tuna salad and she will send it back if it's slightly over cooked. I had stuffed sole which was nicely done with an interesting cranberry walnut stuffing. She had raw oysters as well which she also liked very much, large and clean, from near Bristol RI. We also tried the macadamia shrimp with an amarreto sauce that I thought was to die for. We each had a martini, no wine, and the bill was under $100. We were pleased.

April 24, 2011|Top-Notch Experience|5|My husband and I have regularly frequented Hemenway's since getting engaged there back in 2001. The food, service and quality of the experience never disappoint and we highly recommend Hemenway's to family and friends.

This time we tried the natural beef sirloin. It was good but a bit pricey given that the taste was nothing out of the ordinary. But the smashed potatoes and oysters, as always, were excellent.
April 2, 2011|Our evening started off well.|1|"Our evening started off well. We were immediately seated at a waterfront table. Our waitstaff was courteous and efficient.An appetizer of calamari was delicious and quickly disappeared.However, the three ""Chefs Selections"" were bland and boring.Each of the three entree's neither highlighted the fish nor arroused any tastebuds.All 3 of us were disappointed. As it was a birthday dinner, we didn't even stay for the cake and went elsewhere. The last time I was there the dinner was exceptional, far from it this time. I won't go back."

The sides are a huge disappointment compared to the main seafood dish which are usually excellent. Salads are fresh and plentiful. Chowder was very good.
February 18, 2011|A delightful seafood find|4|A delightful seafood find in Providence. Upscale setting with fresh seafood to match. The clam chowder was sustaining and rich, and the grilled Mahi-Mahi was done to perfection. The service was attentive without being intrusive.

February 14, 2011|We always think of Hemenway's|4|"We always think of Hemenway's as a place to celebrate ""special occasions"" as it is 45 min from home. Valentine's Day being one of those occasions it was an easy decision. We've been there before for Valenjtine's Day but it seemed the restaurant had changed. The upscale air was replaced by a more ""easy going"" atmosphere. The waitstaff were wearing black open neck shirts our waiter, although very competent, fell into that folksy demeanor you get at a thousand other restaurants. We have had Steve B, in the past and his service was memorable. The food was excellent and the portions healthy. I hope it doesn't become just another restaurant,"

February 12, 2011|Hemenway' got greedy and overbooked|2|"We arrived 15 minutes before our 7:45 PM reservation at Hemenway's for our Saturday pre-Valentine's day dinner. We were told there was ""a few minute wait"" and it was suggested that we ""grab a drink at the bar while we wait"". We did just that. We stood around the over crowded bar, elbow to elbow, for 35 long, hungry minutes. After I twice went to the hostess asking what the issue was we were eventually escorted to a fold-out table with a table cloth over it to be seated. We were not dining until almost 9:00 PM after all was said and done. The food was good as was expected and the service, when attended to, was polite. Bottom line, the restaurant became greedy and overbooked and lost the ability to properly see to its patron's requests."
February 11, 2011|Charming Providence Seafood eatery|4|Hemenway's was reccommend by several friends who had spent time in Providence. The restaurant was slightly more causual than advertised and it seems perfectly acceptable to wear something a little more casual than 'business casual'. Everyone at the bar was wearing jeans. The cuisine was basic high quality New England Seafood. Great Clam Chowder, Oysters were excellent and the entrees (we all had one of the fish specials) were very well prepared and large portion size. Dessert options were also excellent. Not that impressed with the wine selection, thought it was just okay. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Service was excellent and the restaurant was very comfortable.
February 9, 2011|Great food, Excellent service|4|"I recently hosted 2 clients for out of state at Hemenway's. Prior to their visit they let me know they loved seafood, so the restaurant was my obvious choice. The food was excellent. In fact, my client for the D.C. / Virginia area said her scallops were the best she has ever had and raved about them the whole next day. For me, the best part of the experience was the service. Ruby was out server and she was spot on right from the beginning. The restaurant as a whole is a top knotch establishment and definitely a ""must eat at"" in Providence."

He continued attentive service throughout our meal, including a Happy Birthday greeting for our 12-year-old granddaughter. She loves calamari, so that was our starter. Very tasty, though a bit shy on the amount of calamari. The entrees--lobster salad, grilled scallops on ravioli, seafood on linguine--were generous with lettuce and pasta, though the ravioli was slightly beyond al dente. Our server brought a beautiful chocolate dessert for our granddaughter, complete with a birthday candle. All in all, Hemenway's made this a special evening for our family.

November 26, 2010|Wow, what a great place. This|5|Wow, what a great place. This was our first time at Hemenway's. We were in Providence for a short trip and ate at a seafood place in a town full of steakhouses and Italian restaurants. So glad we did. Our server was one of the best we have had anywhere. Great food and wine suggestions, attentive without being overboard. On to the food - we started with the Portuguese grilled clams with chorizo. Excellent. My companion spooned up and drank the rest of the sauce! For entrees, I had the stuffed sole, she had the seafood casserole. Quantities were huge but we took a white chocolate mousse to go. Based on the other reviews I expected this place would be good, but I wasn't expecting food and service comparable to Boston or New York. Excellent

November 13, 2010|Great experience! Excellent|4|Great experience! Excellent service by our waitress who took time to help us with everything from wine to oysters. Truly a seafood lovers haven. Well stocked bar; my friend ordered an esoteric cocktail and they had the ingredients. Rather expensive so certainly a special ocassion type of place. Only criticisms would be that they ran out of one of the chef specialties I really wanted to try and it took a long time for our entrees to come out (over an hour), which wasnt a big deal for us since it gave us more time for conversation. Overall, great restaurant, would definitely go back.
November 13, 2010|Food was very good and the|5|Food was very good and the wait staff was wonderful. My wife told our server that she had food allergies. The server double checked everything we wanted to order with the chef. They modified an appetizer for us and also my wife's main dish. Very, very accommodating and the food did not suffer for the modifications. My wife's Salmon and Sea scallops was super, she kept raving about the melt in your mouth scallops. I had the seafood casserole and took half of it home. Great place and we'll definitely return.

Our waiter, Bill, made great suggestions for food and wine, and I really felt like he was taking care of us. We had the Portuguese littlenecks to start off and it was superb. I think it is was the best part of the entire meal. My boyfriend ordered the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops with butternut squash ravioli, which was unique and a great Autumn dish. I ordered the pan-roasted grouper, which was not as unique or flavorful as the sea scallops, but the grouper piece they served was beautiful. Finally, Bill topped the night off with a surprise Chocolate Lava Cake on the house for my boyfriend (I had mentioned it was his b-day). Overall great time!

We had the crab and lobster cakes to start (the best tasting ones I've ever had). I had a pan seared salmon dish w/jumbo shrimp and spinach. It was by far the best meal I've ever had. I do not remember what we had for desert, but it was chocolate and it was really good. We're ready for round two ;-)

She wished us a happy anniversary and we were given free chowder of choice and chocolate cake dessert {which we took home to enjoy}. The whole night was just so special... we had such an amazing time. She contstantly tended to our needs, went a step above to get to know us and gave us her honest recommendations when we were deciding between entrees. Our food was presented in the most professional manner, and she was probably one of the most attentive servers I've ever had. Additionally, after paying with our USAA card, she thanked my husband for serving. God Bless!

We each started w/a cup of soup, Manhattan clam chowder and the lobster bisque. Both were great. Instead of an entree we split the shell fish platter that came w/lobster, shrimp, oysters and clams...Amazing!! For dessert we had the carrot cake and key lime pie and that was great too.

Garlic vinaigrette dressing on salad was overpowering (and there was too much of it), with an aftertaste so strong that the it affected the entree. To top it off, a large group celebrating a birthday was in the room, taking many, many flash pictures all evening. The restaurant staff made no attempt to stop the picture taking, which ruined the ambiance for us. Probably will not go back based on this experience.

We have been to The Moorings, Newport, many times and have always enjoyed our meals...thought since the same owners, Hemingway's might be of the same caliber, but it's not. We thought our meals at Hemingway's were mediocre at best. The burger was the worst. We had called ahead of time to ask if they served burgers at dinner as they were not on the website menu. We were told they did. Turns out the burger is on the Kids' Menu and it was a kids' burger for sure. On top of that, we had to send the first burger back because it was so well done. The second one was a little better but still dry. Needless to say, we will never return there nor will we recommend it to anyone we know who is going to Providence.

The waiter did apologize for that and was very attentive throughout the rest of the evening. It was brought to the attention of the chef when he came to our table.

What also bothered me was that I had made reservations for 8:00p and waited until 8:40p to be seated. Overall it's not a bad place but if you're looking for a great dining experience I'd try another restaurant.

I had the crab salmon entree and it was awful.It was definately sitting under a lamp, the fish was overcooked and the aspaagus dry.

Also check being presented before it is wanted...sends a very unfriendly message. Plates being picked up without asking if the diner is finished. Food well prepared, the view is great but the restaurant is too noisy with all the tile flooring and nothing to absorb the sound. I would go back, but a good conversation with the waiter at the outset might improve the overall experience.

May 1, 2010|We hadn't been to Hemenway's|5|We hadn't been to Hemenway's in several years so I wasn't sure what to expect especially since a co-worker had dined there the previous evening and told me of her very poor experience. I was pleasantly relieved to find Hemenway's to be as wonderful and romantic as I remembered it to be many years ago. We were celebrating 26 years of marriage and we could not have picked a better server. Louise made our evening very special. We were very impressed by the mature and experienced wait staff. The food was outstanding and it was a perfect evening.

April 18, 2010|The overall experience was|4|"The overall experience was good though the tables were a bit crowded. The woman who was sitting behind me had to leave her table twice and on each occasion she bumped into the back of my chair. Though she said sorry each time, it detracted from the conversation that I was having with my wife. The Black & Tan Beer I ordered had about a 2"" head on it, so I paid for foam and not beer. All other aspects of the dinning experience were wonderful. We had a knowledgeable, friendly waiter, excellent service wonderful food that was cooked to perfection....I would recommend this restaurant to a friend and would return.."
April 18, 2010|Great food and great service|5|Great food and great service - as usual. The fish was fresh and well prepared with a variety of offerings. I usually get Mahi-mahi but was tempted this time by grilled halibut over asiago potatoes - I was not disappointed. My companions had salmon (1 blackened and 1 just grilled) and scallops and all enjoyed their meal. We had a complimentary appetizer (related to PPAC subscription) of Macadamia encrusted shrimp and we all loved it - especially the sauce on the plate for dipping. I come back here time and time again because of the consistent food and service.
April 16, 2010|It was great we celebrated|5|It was great we celebrated our 10th anniversary! They gave us a nice view and toast on the Hemenway's
April 9, 2010|My husband and I went here|5|My husband and I went here for the second time this weekend. The food was delicious. We got shrimp cocktail and Pan seared sesame tuna for appetizers. They were both fresh and flavorful. My husband got the seafood casserole which was excellent. He was pleasantly surprised with how much lobster was in the dish. I ordered the baked scallops which were also excellent. Overall we had a great meal and great service.
April 7, 2010|always wish they were better|3|always wish they were better than they are. Service is perfunctory, food is variable. Their steamers were wonderful, but have been underwhelmed by their preparation of fish. For the price, they SHOULD be as good as Legal Seafoods, but they are not.
April 4, 2010|Easter Sunday late afternoon|4|Easter Sunday late afternoon the kitchen was a little slow and there seemed to be a long wait between courses. It was a beautiful day and we had a lovely table with a river view, so the wiat was pleasant. The bottle of white wine was a little warm, which was disappointing. However, the food and presentation was fabulous (as usual) and the wait staff was attentive and apologetic for the slow pace of service. Still one of our favorite places to eat in Providence, and we always enjoy any of the restaurants under the Newport Harbor Corporation.

I have no problem paying top dollar for great food, but this stuff tasted what i imagine seafood from Red Lobster might taste like (I have never been). The fish was fishy. The flavors onthe chefs special were unbalanced. The waitress was a basket case and took forever to get drinks, check and see how the food was, and didn't know the details of the menu. This was a $200 disappointment.

Service was slow, our table cramped (the next table was overcrowded, to our detriment), and we were notified very late of one of our entree selections being unavailable, with nothing more than an ""I'm sorry"" from the manager. Still, this is a fine restaurant, and I will return."

Cory was our server and he was great and gave his ideas on dinner selections.He was so nice and put in our appertiser right away, we used the PPAC free appertiser coupon. I didn't care for the salad dressing I picked and he brought 2 others to choose from. He made the dinner stress free. The food was great, especially the butternut squash. We didn't have time for dessert because we had theatre tickets. I would definitely go back.

February 14, 2010|Hemenways is one of our favorite|3|Hemenways is one of our favorite restaurants. We have been going there for 15+ yrs. and have never been disappointed. Our waiter, while very busy, was still attentive. Our food was excellent, and served hot! However, despite our reservation, we still waited 20 minutes for our table(we did manage to find 2 seats at the bar). The arrangement of tables was different from the norm. Instead of comfortable tables which normally seat 2-4 people, parties of 2 were seated at these very small, collapsable, round tables which were uncomfortable and only allowed for one person in the party to view the river. This was disappointing, and it is my hope that this was an isolated incident as it was Val. Day. We will visit again, but

I realize it is one of your busiest days, however the waiter was exceptionally slow. Other customers that were seated were on main courses before we got our appetizer. This establishment is under new management. It needs to focus on service.

The Calamari was excellent, tender and spicy as always! The Lobster bisque the best in New England and my Hemenway's Seafood Pasta was delicious. I'm ashamed to say I ate it all!(It was enough for two) GREAT FOOD and SUPERB SERVICE."
February 13, 2010|Everytime I am in Providence|3|Everytime I am in Providence I have to come to Hemenway's. The food is out of this world. Seafood is always fresh and the steak is cooked to perfection. My only complaint is on special occasions, i.e Valentine's Day, they try to pack as many tables in as they can and this causes the couple next to you to basically be dining with you. Which normal respective people won't mind. But we had this couple next to us that kept staring and made it uncomfortable to hold a conversation.

Unfortunately the restaurant tried to maximize on space and added extra tables in order to pack in more people. This made the space cramped and very noisy. Due to the over crowding and additional table changes, the wait staff were confused when delivering as was apparent when on two occasions the staff did not know what went with what table.

January 16, 2010|We went for dinner on a Sat|4|We went for dinner on a Sat evening before a show. Our waiter (Tom) was fantastic. Clearly this restaurant has long term employees serving their food vs. waitstaff that turns over frequently. Tom knew the menu and wine inside and out, was very attentive, and was very genuine. He managed our time well. We had the baked stuff lobster. My only complaint was the crab in the stuffing had a bit of a fishy smell. the lobster itself and scallops (in the stuffing) were delicious. Tom had told us that there would be just a sprinkling of crumbs on top and he was right. However, my personal preference would be for something with a little more flavor. We had the Grand Shellfish Platter as an appetizer and that was delicious. Will go back again!

December 26, 2009|This visit marked my third|5|This visit marked my third year of birthday celebrations at Hemenway's and each year the restaurant continues to live up to and exceed my expectations. This birthday was a bit special - it was my 40th. Our waiter surprised me with a complimentary Macadamia Shrimp appetizer which I was dying to try and will now be one of my favorites and the warm chocolate cake with strawberry sauce is always a perfect ending. The photo they took and printed for me was very special since I was dining with my 6 and 3 yr old. I would also like to thank Tom, our waiter. I luck out and sit in his section each year and he is always the BEST!! I hope to have the opportunity to continue this tradition for many years to come.

December 11, 2009|I was amazed at how easy and|4|I was amazed at how easy and efficient making reservations through opentable.com was. My girlfriend and I have had less than great experiences going out for dinner in Providence. For example, often times we have to call for reservations, are put on hold, cannot get the time we want, and once we arrive the service is usually unsatisfactory. By making reservations through opentable.com, I simply went on line, found an excellent restaurant, was able to get the time we wanted, there was no wait at all, and the service was beyond anything I have ever seen. I would recommend both Hemingway's Restaurant and using opentable.com to schedule your reservations to anyone.

Menu was simple and predictable and our party was disappointed to find out that the Halibut, listed on both the internet and print menus handed to us at the table, was no longer available ""for the season."" 3/5 party members had planned to order this dish. Still, the service was excellent for the most part, and it was nice to have a salad come with each entree. My fish reminded me a lot of McCormick & Schmick's offerings - this is an upscale restaurant, but a chain nonetheless. My biggest complaint (and only significant one) would be the lack of desirable atmosphere. Neon window lights and tile floors did little for the place and were all it had- river views nonexistent!"

Although it was not at all busy, the service was extremely mediocre in every way-bordering on terrible. Oysters and shrimp were OK for first course: entrees were not much better- vegatables unimaginitive and served luke warm as if they had been cooked hours before and not warmed up. Although we didn't do dessert, the ones that went by did look good. The food wasn't bad- just nothing special. For the prices that they are charging, they need to ramp up the kitchen here- I would rather go to McCormick's at the BIltmore.......

My wife and I always go out to dinner for our anniversary and have been to many restaurants. This was our best overall experience. From the moment we arrived we were treated very well. The hostess wished us a happy anniversary and brought us to a lovely table covered with flower petals. The wine list had one of our favorite bottles of wine and the menu's selection made it hard to choose just one item for dinner. We chose the lobster ravioli and a pumpkin seed topped salmon. They were both incredible. For dessert we decided on cheesecake which was delivered(complimentary)with a candle and more well wishes for our anniversary.
October 17, 2009|Been here several times before,|4|Been here several times before, but this was the first time to make reservation via Open Table. We were seated instantly on a very busy Saturday night, which says a lot for the Open Table concept. Good food, generally, but the steamers were marginal, especially given that we are in Rhode Island. They were out of the wine special, but substituted another that was excellent. The waitress was experienced, knowledgeable, friendly, and funny, but she was a little slow - perhaps because she had one too many tables. All in all, a good experience, and we'll go back.

October 10, 2009|Don't let the seemingly attractive|1|Don't let the seemingly attractive ambiance and excellent location fool you into thinking this is a good choice for dinner. Unless you're a local celebrity be prepared to wait an hour after your reservation time to be given the privilege of sitting at a table and waiting another 45 minutes for ordering & receiving your food. At this point even if the lobsters came out dancing to the Michigan Rag it still would rate as a place to avoid unless you're famous or not really hungry. As it turns out there was no dancing lobster – which is a good thing as the waiters couldn’t manage to serve the four of us our entres at the same time anyway. Two plates came out – then a third 3 minutes later, then the fourth a full 15 minutes later. Very poor.

I had the swordfish steak special and I wanted to lick the plate! All entrees come with salad and choice of veggies. They have a nice wine selection and a great dessert selection as well. Our waiter was very nice and didn't rush. The place was packed and I can sse why now that we finally tried this great restaurant.

September 19, 2009|The food was excellent and|4|The food was excellent and our server was outstanding. However, we were very disappointed with the reservation. We showed up on time, but we were seated 20 minutes late. When we first checked in, we were told tables were being set up. We waited another 15 minutes and I asked another hostess why we weren't seated yet when we had a reservation and she said they were still setting up tables. It doesn't take 15 minutes to set up tables. I used to work in a restaurant. No one ever apologized to us and the hostess and maitre d were pretty nonchalant about seating us 20 minutes late. We were a little frustrated and surprised by their lack of attention to our reservation.
September 19, 2009|My friends and I travel to|4|My friends and I travel to Rhode Island once a year and always eat at Hemenways. The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is great. However, on a Saturday night the place is crazy busy, the waiter rushed, the food slow, and the noise level tremendous. Open Table was a sure bet for the reservation and will continue to use this service. In past years a telephone reservation has not been honored.

The food is always excellent, the service was impeccable (thank you Stephanie) and the location and views can't be beat. I have been going here for over 20 years and do not plan to stop anytime soon.
September 6, 2009|"Service is always ""over the"|5|"Service is always ""over the top"". Food is consitently outstanding. We always feel as if we are being treated ""special"" when we dine in this restaurant."
September 6, 2009|It was my first time at Hemenways.|5|It was my first time at Hemenways. My wife had been there while in college. We liked the restaurant, very clean, service was excellent. The food was excellent. They placed rose petals on the table to celebrate our Anniversary. The waite staff congratulated us on their way past. The menu was varied and everything looked delicious!
September 5, 2009|We were in town for Waterfire|4|We were in town for Waterfire and picked Hemenway's off of the internet since it appeared to be withing walking distance of our hotel and the festivities and we enjoy seafood. The place was mobbed, but when we arrived with our reservations, we were seated immediately. Frank, our server, assured us that he'd take care of us, and he did, very well. As busy as the place was, Frank managed to stop at our table every ten minutes or so to make sure all was well and to replenish drinks and clear dishes. The food was very good. Filet mingon grilled perfectly, fork-tender with a delicious flavor. Baked stuffed shrimp firm & sweet with a perfect cracker and crab meat stuffing. Tender grilled sea scallops. A great experience.
September 5, 2009|We were going to Waterfire|4|We were going to Waterfire and picked Hemenway's since it is on the river and within easy walking distance of Waterfire. It was very busy when we arrived, but since we had a reservation, we were seated immediately. We had requested a window table when we made our reservation and our request was honored. Our server was excellent. The food was very good. Overall, it was a great experience.
September 4, 2009|We had a great visit. The|4|We had a great visit. The restaurant was very accommodating for a table of eight. The food was terrific followed by an excellent waitress called Annie. The food was served in a very reasonable time frame fresh and hot. It was a pleasant experience and one that will make us come back again. A very nice surprise!

September 2, 2009|Everything was excellent.|5|Everything was excellent. The menu is extensive and makes it very hard to choose. Food was very good and the portions were large; plus the meal comes witha fabulous salad. Plan to take someone there again next week for a birthday dinner !
August 29, 2009|Nice atmosphere but now on|3|Nice atmosphere but now on two occasions, our food has come out lukewarm. Our food took a very long time to come out... we were glad we ordered appetizers, which by the way, were very good (oysters and clams). I ordered the halibut which was overcooked. My husband ordered the surf and turf, which came out lukewarm, borderline cold. The restaurant seems to have a problem timing food. If you don't mind this, Hememgway's has a great atmosphere.
August 22, 2009|My wife and I have been at|2|My wife and I have been at Hemenway's restaurant on several occasions. This past Saturday night we had made reservations for 8:30 as Waterfire was being held. We were disappointed in the poor service we received from our waitress. Painfully slow service. We only ordered a bottle of wine and a dozen oysters and we were there for an hour and half. The oysters and wine were delicious as usual. The waitress on the other hand was absent for a majority of our time. I know that it was just our waitress, as we saw all the other waitstaff bustling about, but ours as mainly absent. If you go, ask for Annie as your waitress. She will take excellent care of you.

August 1, 2009|Seafood dishes were outstanding.|4|Seafood dishes were outstanding. Had the lobster bisque and clam chowder....both great. We also had the potato crusted halibut with scallops and a striped bass ala Oscar. Superior fresh seafood. Exceptional. The place was packed and now I know why. Definitely a must for anyone going to Providence. Service was fair to poor. I couldn't even get my water glass refilled in a timely manner. I would have rated this an outstanding if the service was better.
July 25, 2009|We have been here many, many|4|"We have been here many, many times over the past 25 years. This time was disappointing. Waiter was wonderful! Of three dinners one, swordfish, was great, two, Scrod and Tilapia were dried out and blah, more so than the fish themselves which are, admittedly, somewhat boring by their very nature. It was very crowded and noisy but it was a ""Waterfire"" night. My feeling is they were over run by diners late into the night and the kitchen was not up to its usual excellent abilities. This experience will not prevent our return but a similar repeat performance would."
July 25, 2009|I brought my girlfriend to|4|I brought my girlfriend to Hemenway's this past weekend for her birthday. We had an 8:30 reservations on Saturday during the waterfire celebration and we were seated on time with a table near the window overlooking the river.

Comparably speaking our food was ok. The steamers were amazing-various shapes and sizes bit very fresh. The calamari was good prepared in the classic Rhode Island style. Entered were less impressive-steak was overcooked, server forgot side that went with salmon, server never bright ketchup for fries, and only four ravioli swimming in too much sauce. Our server practically disappeared at the end of our meal making it difficult to pay the check.

I ordered the mixed seafood grille---horrible--the swordfish was dry,the tuna was overcooked and the scrod was nothing special. I wish I sent it back and ordered something else.The dish cost $25+ --definitely not worth it.

I think we have found it!!!!! My husband LOVES oysters and theirs were phenomenal! We had the cold seafood appetizer to start, I had the king crab legs for dinner and he has a stuffed lobster. He didn't really like the stuffing but it was a minor set back in the grand scheme of things!!! Our waitress was wonderful and our appitizer and main courses were timed accordingly. We didn't wait for anything! We give Hemenway's an A+"
July 3, 2009|Our overall experience was|4|Our overall experience was good. Service was outstanding. The restaurant serves very good seafood and good accompanyments.

They accommodated the request of being seated along the window with view of the river which was beautiful once the sun went down. There was no waiting, our reservation was ready on time and the food was cooked as requested. If we ever make another trip to Providence, they found themselves with a repeat customer.

He was kind and patient and recommended interesting dishes for us to try. We are still talking about our time at the restaurant. I think it is one of the very best restaurants I have been to.

Despite a nondescript office building setting, the ambiance works for a variety of occasions. Upscale but not stuffy. My kids love it but they have educated palates and are veteran restaurant diners. Probably not good for little kids. Good place to take business associates, meeting in-laws for the first time, and other special occasions.

June 13, 2009|Very popular restaurant, nice|3|Very popular restaurant, nice views of waterfire. I had the yellow fin tuna was sent to me rare when I ordered it well done. Came back no presentation on the plate. There was a baked potato in a small casserole dish with the tuna steak. Steak was cooked good the second time, but tasteless. My husband had the salmon and said it was mushy. We were both very disappointed. The restaurant was very busy. We were with another couple who did not rave about their meals either. Check was $200 including tip which was ver pricey for the quality of the meals.
June 13, 2009|The service was great to start|4|The service was great to start but unfortunately there was a group next to us requesting individual checks. My guests were cold from the air vents overhead and stepped out while I took care of the check. Because of the large group I had to wait 20 minutes to get my bill squared away.

Steve, the waiter, was attentive and helpful with suggetions and some of his own recommendations. Both our meals were outstanding. I had a new taste sensation with soft shell crabs served cooked tempura on a wasabi cream sauce that was out of this world! My wife's filet mignon was so well prepared that she didn't need to season it, which she almost always does. The price was commensurate with the meals and service. It's not our normal place to dine out, but for special occasions it's a wonderful choice.

The service is usually always good to great depending on the wait person. This is not a five star restaurant, but it is an enjoyable evening and a good value too. I'm a regular here, and go once a month at least when I want a good seafood dinner. I think they are the best seafood in Providence."
June 3, 2009|The dining experience was|5|The dining experience was overall one of the best I've ever had. Our waiter was most attentive, friendly and very helpful with recommendations. Between an appetizer, salad, main course and dessert, our meal lasted over 2 1/2 hours. We were never rushed and there was enough time between each course to settle. All of the food was excellent. My main course of halibut and lobster, something I would not have thought putting together. For dessert, they have mastered a classic key lime pie. Again, the food was excellent.

Well, the colleges won't change their graduation dates, and we won't change our anniversary one either. Hemenway's always makes the night special. The food is outstanding, the service stellar, and twice we've been asked if it was a special occasion. When revealing our anniversary, the restaurant has always treated us to a special perk...a glass of champagne, or a complimentary dessert. That's class, and Hemenway's is in one all by itself.

May 13, 2009|The food was the real issue|2|The food was the real issue here. Waitstaff was very good and the restaurant itself was very nice but unless my experience was an anomaly, this felt like a restaurant that has been resting on its laurels. Overcooked lobster, overly hot soups and tepid entrees were the order of the day. The food itself was very average, especially for the money. There was absolutely nothing noteworthy. Even something seemingly as simple as the salad was slapped together with yellowing iceberg lettuce, too sweet dressings and the requisite Bermuda onion ring. I was very disappointed, especially after hearing so much about this place.
Dined on May 12, 2009|Hemenway's never disappoints|4|Hemenway's never disappoints and there is something for everyone here, but the seafood is wonderful. I go for the oysters and fresh fish and their wonderful wine list.

As a long-time diner with Hemenway's, the staff seated us next to a window with a panoramic view of downtown Providence and the waterfront. We were also seated in the section of our favorite server, Diane, a consummate professional. Once we had ordered our entrees and had enjoyed the oven-fresh rolls, Diane brought over a complimentary appetizer of coconut/almond crusted shrimp. Delicious! She also brought us a delicious molten chocolate cake with strawberry filling--also complimentary--for dessert. Overall, Hemenway's is a fantastic restaurant for birthdays, anniversarys, and other special occasions.

Danny told us that we could mix and match anything we wanted on the menu. All 7 of us were very pleased. My sister-in law was not fond of her choice of salad dressing and as soon as our waiter was told, he brought her out another one.

Nicely laid out, tables by windows overlooking river. High ceilings make for moderate noise level - lively, energetic. We will be back again this summer as this appeared to be beautiful area to stroll through when the climate comes around.
March 27, 2009|Great personalized service.|5|Great personalized service. Our waiter Danny made our 1st experience at the restaurant a phenomenal one. The food was outstanding and the atmosphere was wonderful. Danny recommended certain appetizers and we went with his suggestions. The sesame tuna as well as the calamari with hot peppers were delightful! Danny brought us some samples of Macadamia shrimp that you would die for. The Clam Chowder was the best I ever tasted. Our entrée was exceptionally cooked to perfection. The staff even asked us to cut into our steaks to be sure they were as we ordered them. Parking was validated and our car was parked for us. I will be going back again next week for my Dads 75 birthday. Great place!

If you like fish that is fresh and isn't drowning in some overbearing sauce that undercuts the flavor, this is the place to go. If you don't make reservations, there is a small group of tables near the bar to accommodate walk-ins.

The price was adequate. The atmosphere was very romantic and friendly. The tables are a little to close to each other, but was lucky enough to get a booth. Waitstaff was very friendly and on top of things. One of the best meals I have ever had. Definetly will be going back.
February 14, 2009|We thoroughly enjoyed our|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our Valentine's dinner at Hemenway's. The service and the food were great. My only minor complaint is that they opened up a backroom and squeezed in about 15-18 tables for two in rows. Not much ambience in that room. Too many tables, too close, too uniform. We definitely would go back on a regular night, and ask not to be put in that room on special occasions.
February 14, 2009|My wife and I went for an|2|"My wife and I went for an early dinner on Valentine's Day (5:30) before theater. I was hoping for (and expecting) something much better from Hemenway's. I have not been there before, so I can only hope that the extremely close proximity of tables was due to squeezing in many additional tables on Valentine's. We were nearly elbow to elbow with the next table. At 5:30, the place was already PACKED. Contrary to our main concern, service was SO fast, we could have been out in 35 minutes. A bit hurried for dining, but arguably better than running slow. Problem was that the food was average at BEST. I was hoping for something a few notches above Legal's, but it ranking more with ""The 99"" or TGIFriday's in terms of cuisine that evening."
February 12, 2009|This was not our first visit,|4|This was not our first visit, but it was one of the best. We took advantage of the dinner for 2 deal, and each had the baked stuffed lobster. We started the meal with the coconut encrusted shrimp, whick had 7 perfectly cooked shrimp. the sauce was outstanding as well. The next course was a ceasar slald for both of us. The dressing was the fresh, anchoivi kind and it was good. For desert, we had the white chocolate mousse, and it was excellent. I would highly recommend this place for a special dinner.
February 7, 2009|I have never had a bad experience|4|I have never had a bad experience at Hemenway's. The food is always fantastic, the service always great and very accommodating. The atmosphere is a little noisy so if you are looking for a quiet place, this is not the place to go. Ask for a table by the back windows so you can get a view of the city.

We absolutely LOVED it!!!

We were celebrating our wedding anniversarry in RI. We had planned to be in the Caribbean for that week but a family emergence called for us to cancel our vacation. When the staff heard about our misfortune, they went out of their way to see to it that we were very well taken care of with the finest care. We dine here often and we love this restaurant. The fish is ALWAYS fresh / even in winter and the staff is ALWAYS so wonderful. This is a top notch restaurant that is sure to please. Worth every penny.

Oysters are always good and I think if the seafood is really fresh you can't beat it. Their calamari is the best in Providence as is the Key Lime Pie. Have had an incident where it wasn't, but the waitstaff took it back and was very gracious. It is always pretty to sit by one of the windows and look out at Providence, I find it romantic to sit at a table overlooking the river.

Service has only ever been bad once, and that person is long gone. Lobster bisque to die for, jumbo lump crab salad with a fabulous honey-dijon mustard dressing; fish cooked the way you want it; some non-seafood entrees look as good as the seafood ones are. Best part? They notice when you are wearing black and switch your white, lint-heavy napkin for a dark blue one. Is that totally cool, or what?
November 26, 2008|We went for an early dinner|4|We went for an early dinner before a holiday weekend so it was not crowded at all. Service was excllent and food was good but not spectacular. Not a place for kids as we had our two little ones and they did not have a kids menu, just rambled off some things that they could make. Additionally, what we did order for the kids they did not like but instead ate rolls, fries and cole slaw. I would def. go again only for a special occasion with my husband (minus the kids).

The ambiance is elegant but relaxed with white table cloths and lots of windows. Weekend lunch was good as it was not as busy as this restaurant is at night. Food (we all had fish, seafood) was excellent. Wine list is good with many options by the glass. Our waiter was knowledgeable and provided good service. The clam chowder and lobster bisque were both noteable. Nice variety of fish, seafood and other options on menu. Definitely will return - Hemenway's has become one of my favorite restaurants in Providence.
October 2, 2008|Hemenway's was not at all|3|Hemenway's was not at all what I had expected. I am a seafood lover, a food lover, and a restaurant lover. I had heard great things about Hemenway's over the years but I had yet to visit. I chose Hemenway's for this year's birthday dinner. The 4 of us were sat at a crowded booth with a nice view. The server was nice, the food was decent, but nothing about the place blew me away. I expected Hemenway's to be larger, fancier, and the food to be phenemenol (with larger portions). I'm not saying the place was bad, just not what I had expected. It seems like a good spot to go out for seafood w/ friends on a casual night out. We went on a Thursday night and the place seemed to have a good size crowd so make reservations!

The waitress did not even try to explain or offer any solution to our disappointment of this charge. Extremely poor customer service"

At the time of our reservation, the restaurant was virtually empty - but as our meal progressed, the bar area got louder and louder. Other than that, the food was good - the amuse-bouche was a nice touch you just don't see everywhere - and our waitress was quite attentive.

Our appetizers (crab & lobster cakes)were barely warm and the clams casinos were not the same. Stuffed sole special was just okay, again barely hot.

The menu selections were excellent with some very different preparations for traditional dishes...i.e. the pineapple and cashew glazed salmon. The baked stuffed shrimp was succulent and moist....no extra dipping butter needed! The salad was nicely chilled and crispy! A good choice for celebrating birthdays or special occasions. There is even a nice small park/memorial to walk around in after your meal!

The other party of four next to us (who arrived 30 minutes after us) had already ate their dessert and left before we even saw our entrees. We were so sick of waiting we were ready to leave without dinner. Hoped to see waterfire at 8:30 but didn't make it out of the restaurant until closer to 11. Great restaurant too bad we were stuck with a lousy waitress.

My comments to them that I cannot deliver: We came to Hemenway’s tonight to celebrate the upcoming wedding of our dear friend. Stephanie Matthews was our server and she was exemplary. She picked upon the fact that this was a special celebration and arranged, on her own, to have Steve Palumbo serenade our friends with a song as we left. How great is that!!!

Highly recommended even on a holiday."
