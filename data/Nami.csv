February 20, 2016|Good food, good service, nice atmosphere|4|Enjoyed our dinner at Nami. The waitress was very helpful and attentive to our special requests. My wife enjoyed her Sushi and I enjoyed the Hibachi Chicken. Prepared very well, and not overpowering. Atmosphere was very nice and we were able to carry on a conversation without having to raise our voices. Not the easiest place to find parking, but not surprising for its location.
February 18, 2016|Love this place!!! Sushi is amazing|5|Love this place!!! Sushi is amazing
February 13, 2016|BEST SUSHI!|5|Best sushi in Rhode Island! Absolutely love the food here.
January 30, 2016|Great Service and food|4|First time at NAMI and the food, wine and service were a great surprise!
January 23, 2016|Great place|5|I had made reservations for my husbands birthday celebration. Due to the snow, we had very few in our group. We loved the service we were provided with. I think only 2 servers were working due to the weather and they were both awesome. They even sang Happy Birthday to my husband even though I insisted that they didn't have to since it was such a sad party. We enjoyed our drinks and meal and very much appreciate the staff for being so accommodating even in poor weather.
January 22, 2016|I went with a friend for Restaurant Week...|4|I went with a friend for Restaurant Week and we were both impressed. A wide variety to choose from on the RW menu. The Devil Roll was delicious and so was the fried cheesecake. I will definitely be back to try items from the regular menu. The service was awesome. Our waiter, Matt, was friendly, attentive, and gave great suggestions. The bartender even came over to make sure that I liked my sake choice.
January 16, 2016|Restaurant week visit|4|We had a great 4 course meal during Restaurant Week that had some unusual menu choices, all of which were very good. The service was friendly and helpful--we appreciated the chance to enjoy a quiet meal -- even with the football game on the bar's tv. The decor is cool and trendy. We will be back there with friends soon.
January 2, 2016|Nami - Not an actual Hibachi restaurant|3|"I googled Hibachi restaurants in PVD and this came up along with Mt. Fuji. Although they have Hibachi listed on the menu, it is not a Hibachi restaurant...this term ""to my friends and I"" implies that there will be a chef preparing the food fresh on a grill while guests are seated around it. This was not the case and we were very disappointed because although they have the grill seating, they currently do not have the ""Hibachi"" chef's???? I made the reservation on line and really should have called to get more information, my bad. The food was good, but again we were disappointed that there was not the ""live entertainment"" that makes the whole Hibachi experience so much fun!"
December 31, 2015|Great place|5|Went out for dinner on New Year's Eve. Everything was wonderful. Our server was very attentive and the food was delicious.
November 7, 2015|Great Sushi|4|The sushi was delicious and was plated beautifully! Our server was very attentive and the atmosphere was very nice.
October 29, 2015|Cool trendy place|4|Appetizing pretty food in a chic ambience. Have been twice and food and service were consistently good.
September 4, 2015|Nice surprise !|4|"Was in the mood for sushi while visiting Providence and was told by locals that this was the place to go. Honestly, wasn't expecting much, especially as the restaurant is touted as being a ""sushi and Japanese Steak house."" These combo places are usually just plain bad. So, imagine our surprise when we discovered that Nami had creativity innovation and great U.S. Style (cool combo rolls) sushi. Really loved the steamed pork sliders on the appetizer list too. Will definitely return the next time I am in town ðŸ˜Ž"
August 29, 2015|Great dining but singer too loud|3|The service was great and the food was delicious. Lamb chops are my favorite and they were prepared to perfection. Appetizers delicious and plentiful. Especially enjoyed the calamari. My partner had sushi and it was prepared attractively and very good. The only criticism is that the diva singing was way too loud and lessened our experience.
February 14, 2015|Valentines Day|5|Our meal and our server were both fantastic. We went on Valentines day with a reservation. We arrived a few minutes early but were seated immediately. The server was very knowledgeable and was able to recommend a few specials based on things we told him we liked and didn't. In addition to a few things on the normal menu, we did order some specials and everything was absolutely delicious. I would go back any time!
January 14, 2015|Good drinks, great food -bad bar service.|4|Served wonderful sushi without providing soy sauce or dish for it. Couldn't get his attention. Bartender chatty with sushi chefs, waitresses. Waited 10 minutes with food in front of us before we could eat. Charming but no attention to detail. A shame for it was the only misstep in our experience but it was a big one. He blew us off with a smile and walked away.
December 12, 2014|Amazing experience and a great find|5|Sushi was amazing, drinks were awesome but the best part was the friendly and fast service!!
November 22, 2014|Best Sushi I Ever Had!|5|I've been here twice with two groups different groups of people and we all said that this was the best sushi we've ever had! The waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful with choosing!
November 12, 2014|Exceptional!|5|Every time I come to this restaurant, I am amazed. The service is always excellent, the food is so good that this restaurant could easily compete with the best of the best restaurants in NYC. The decor is Vegas/Miami super modern and chic. Wendy the manager always comes to the table and asks how everything is (everytime I visit). They truly made my brother's birthday (a party of 12) special. Thanks so much Nami staff and Wendy.
November 1, 2014|Great night at Nami!|5|My first visit to Nami was this past Saturday night. I was pleasantly surprised. I did not realize how attractive it is inside this Federal Hill restaurant. There was lovely music and great food. The most important part of my review is that the service was EXCELLENT! I will be returning for the food, ambience and being treated well. When you are out and spending your money is very very important
October 18, 2014|Mixed experience|3|Mixed. Food was good. Decor and ambiance was cool, but the live music was horrible and the waiter upsold us on too much food we couldn't finish. He also asked odd questions and provided mixed service.
September 20, 2014|A nice night out|4|My fiancÃ©e and I went to NAMI for a Saturday night date. The food was really good and our server was really nice. We ordered miso soup, crab rangoons, and the sushi for two. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
September 12, 2014|awesome|5|sushi is awesome - love the Passion Roll - service is wonderful
September 6, 2014|Unknown to us there was a steel drum ban...|4|Unknown to us there was a steel drum band on Saturday. Very loud. We expected quiet so that we could talk based on the other reviews. Food was prepared well. Surprised that the Hibachi was closed. Fish selection at the sushi bar was somewhat limited. Noodle bowl was very good but, a little too much teriachi for my taste. Seafood bisque was excellent. My wife liked her grilled scallops very much.
September 6, 2014|PERFECT!!|5|Service, food, presentation and atmosphere were exceptional. We visited to celebrate by daughter's 21st and could not have been happier. Everyone went out of their way to make a memorable occasion. The steel drum live music was a great touch. Definitely will return!
September 6, 2014|Great Apps!|4|The food is fantastic. There are so many wonderful apps that my wife and I had a meal of apps. We hope to order a main course some day. The atmosphere is upscale.
September 6, 2014|Best sushi in Providence|5|Nami is outstanding! They have the best sushi in Providence in my opinion. Great service, modern atmosphere, huge selection of sushi and sashimi as well as other great meal choices. Highly recommended!
August 31, 2014|best sushi in Providence|4|I finally don't feel I have to drive up to Brookline, MA for good sushi. Presentation was really beautiful too.
June 30, 2014|Great meal, reasonable prices|5|Last-minute night out and we were not disappointed. The sushi was excellent and the staff very informative.
June 21, 2014|Good times|5|The food and service were great. I would definitely come back.
May 25, 2014|great food!|5|the food was amazing but what impressed me was how they catered the service to each customer, as they offered brown rice substitutions for sushi or soy rice paper.
May 24, 2014|GREAT GRADUATION LUNCH|5|Hungry after college graduation ceremonies, and not wanting bar food or Italian, our college graduate suggested Nami. Walked in, were seated right away, and our hopes were more than met. Good craft beer on tap, helpful suggestions from the very friendly waiter, and an awesome platter of sushi came forth after a wonderful appetizer of the mango grilled shrimp entree. Highly recommended. Though expensive, you get what you pay for.
May 23, 2014|So delicious, great atmosphere!|5|I went there with a group of girls for my bday. Food was so delicious, waiter was extremely helpful, my white Sangria was amazing. We ordered many different samplings & there wasn't a morsel left! They even brought out a too die for chocolate covered moose dessert w a candle! So good! Crowded but the place is very spacious. I will definitely be back.
April 12, 2014|Went there on Saturday evening|4|Went there on Saturday evening with my husband and another couple for dinner. We shared sushi for our starters and split 2 dinners between the 4 of us. The sushi was fresh and delicious! Dinner was just as good as well as the martini's. We will definitely return!
March 28, 2014|Nine place,friendly staff,|4|Nine place,friendly staff, good sushi, reasonable price.will recommend name to friends.
March 22, 2014|Didn't have the wine that|3|Didn't have the wine that we wanted but overall the experience was good. The rolls were huge so for a party of (4) to share four rolls was plenty!
February 22, 2014|Great food, creative inventive|5|Great food, creative inventive dishes, all plated beautifully. Friendly staff, great modern decor. Definitely one of the best if not the best sushi spot in RI. Went with a group on a Saturday night and it was fairly full but not as busy as one would expect for a Saturday night. I really hope this place sticks around because the food and ambience is awesome.
February 22, 2014|worked with us in a time pinch|4|We had made reservations with what we thought would be plenty of time to still make our concert plans. We did not anticipate the long time it took to get to and down Atwells Ave. on a Sat nite. There is free valet parking, which is a big plus....as some restaurants charge large sums for valet parking on Atwells. When we announced our time restraints, we were told that would not be a problem, and it wasn't. If we were discussing a dish that would take too long to prepare, we were told as much. Everything came out timely, was tasty and was presented in a beautiful fashion(especially the sea urchin). Have already recommended the restaurant to my son.
February 14, 2014|Great food|4|My GF and I went late on v-day (9:30) & we were expecting chaos, everything was smooth & as soon as we got there we sat within 10 min. We got out drinks at the bar first and the male behind the counter was very friendly. Once our table was ready we ordered 3 rolls of sushi, no apps. Our good came out prob an hour later which would have been fine if our waitress had come to our table at all to check up on us. I had to flag her down to ask where it was. I understand it's busy on a holiday but at least check in with us. Besides that we had a perfect evening. Drinks, sushi, and atmosphere were perfect, service.....just check in with your table a little more. Will recommend tho! One experience doesn't make up my mind about a restaurant.
February 14, 2014|Valentine's Day|4|With a reduced menu and a very busy restaurant - it is difficult to provide a complete review. With that said, sushi was amazing and drinks were favorites with all parties. Presentation was great as well - very unique. In addition we ordered one entree (salmon) that was awesome... In short - definitely worth a try - we will be back when the hibachi grills are open
Dined on February 13, 2014|Sushi was great along with|4|Sushi was great along with the staff. We used the complimentary VIP parking. Received our car a noticed a horrible smell, it reminded me of the Seinfeld episode. He also forgot to put my car in park before turning it off. Everything was nice until grabbing my car which kind of put me in a bad mood.
February 8, 2014|Excellent|5|Food was great as was the service ,our waiter Joe was knowledgable and made great reccomendations , we will return again
February 1, 2014|Best Sangria!|4|The Sangria and Sushi are outstanding and the ambience is great for a cozy dinner. The prices are quite acceptable as the offerings are of high quality. I would definitely go there again!
January 31, 2014|Great food, other things lacking.|3|"The restaurant was very cold, almost uncomfortably cold. The service was just ""okay"" with a waitress who didn't smile and seemed to have no enthusiasm. The food was very good, and somewhat made up for the lacking friendly service. I would give it another try."
January 25, 2014|Need Improvement|3|Went here on a Saturday night with a party of 4. For starters, the delivery of the food was at the most awkward times. Appetizers did not come out together - one appetizer came out for one side of the table, leaving the other side empty handed. Same thing applied for the entrees, the sushi entrees were delivered about 20 minutes before the hibachi entrees on the table, leaving the sushi eaters sitting there twiddling their thumbs for the last half hour. Adding to the fact that the rice for the hibachi did not come out for an addition 15 minutes after the main dish. The check was dropped off in the middle of the salad course right in the middle of the table. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, but like I said the timing was awful
January 18, 2014|Not the best|2|Nami did have good food but we were the ONLY people in there at 7pm on a Saturday night. The waitress was miserable and acted like we were such a pain to wait on-even though we were her only table. Maybe this is a great lunch place but it was a bit odd how there was on one there on a busy night. The food was really good though and the drinks were spot on.
January 10, 2014|Great Food and Sushi was diverse..|4|The food was fabulous and a very nice atmosphere, though if you're seated near the bar it's quite noisy. The only disappointment was they failed twice to be able to find the wine I wanted. though I'm sure that was an abberation.
January 4, 2014|Amazing find on the hill|5|If youre near the hill and don't want Italian this is the way to go hands down
January 4, 2014|An all around nice restaurant.|4|An all around nice restaurant. Service was friendly and attentive and the food was very good. They have a good selection of rolls, hibachi meals and noodles. Looking forward to eating their again.
December 31, 2013|Nami|5|The bar tender was very loud. There were some people at the bar shouting as if it is a sports bar
December 31, 2013|Was very pleased the food|4|Was very pleased the food was amazing!!! Our server was on top of her game!!!
November 29, 2013|Half half|4|We thought they had hibachi tables but they don't anymore. But you can still order hibachi entrees. They aren't as good when you just order them off the menu without the experience. Other people in my party said their non-seafood entrees were just OK. But everyone agreed, the sushi and other raw seafood was very very good. I would recommend this restaurant for sushi and drinks. The service was incredible. Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.
November 23, 2013|Great Sushi|4|I have visited Nami and few times. I enjoy the atmophere and the food. The presentation is very much to my liking and the sushi is great.
November 21, 2013|Great Sushi|3|I loved the food. I think this is now one of my favorite sushi places in providence. The service was pretty poor. Next time I'll probably eat at the bar.
November 19, 2013|Very nice|5|The service was wonderful. Performance was great. Did not have to wait for the food. Everything was delicious and the portions are big: we ended up taking home a lot.
November 3, 2013|Great sushi/sashimi platter|5|Great sushi/sashimi platter for 2 and great surf and turf. Complimentary valet parking. Not crowded.
October 30, 2013|Bread w/ Sushi?|4|The sushi was very good. The avocado was ripe and very good in the spring rolls and on the salad. Although the music was un-necessarily loud, the atmosphere was modern and fun. But.... bread? Really? One does not expect Italian bread to be served with Japanese food. Weird. And, although the dipping sauces were creative, neither yogurt or green curry sauce is Japanese.
October 27, 2013|Was not impressed|1|We went there after working a trade show, looking forward to a hibachi dinner. They told us they didn't have a chef for hibachi but could make it in the kitchen. Ok so we ordered our meals, finally came out a long time later and the food was all cold. a party of 8. we accepted the food cold because we didn't want to wait any longer. you would think they would have given us something like meals off the bill and around of drinks. It took arguing with the manager to get 10% off the bill. Never going back.
October 16, 2013|Bar Brawl Interrupts Dinner|1|This was the most bizarre dinner my business partner and I have ever experienced. We are both experienced sushi eaters. Based on the Open Table reviews, this seemed like the logical place in Providence. It seemed to start ok, as we were seated in a booth next to the bar. Between the bread basket served on the table, and the loud patrons at the bar, we probably should have seen the red flags everywhere. When our meal came, the server could not identify the sushi - not a good sign. The final straw was the bar fight that occurred during our meal, when on patron decked another, leaving him on the floor bleeding from his face. Police interviews and medics followed. The wait staff disappeared, and took forever for the check. Enough said?
October 5, 2013|Awesome Sushi, Great Bar|5|We've been frequent visitors of Nami since it first opened. The sushi here is great, and the bar scene is pretty good also. Great for a romantic night out of dinner or to have a few drinks and relax.
October 5, 2013|Off to a great start|5|From beginning to end the service was top notch, the food was delicious and the presentation was great. I will definitely return soon.
September 21, 2013|Outstanding|5|This was our second visit to Nami and similar to our first visit the food was outstanding! The menu has a lot of choices for sushi lovers like my husband and non-sushi lovers (like me); and surprisingly they do both VERY well. The service was also top notch. Our server, Amanda was attentive and our drink glasses remained full throughout the night. We highly recommend Nami, definitely a Providence gem!
September 18, 2013|Unexpected find!|4|Nami has a wide variety of sushi items and other foods that I wouldn't normally eat. However, they have an EXCELLENT fried rice dish that can be made with chicken, shrimp, or pork. For a simple side of $8 fried rice, one wouldn't expect it to be something to rave about, but it is truly delicious!
September 7, 2013|Great food|5|Sushi was fresh and delicious. Prices were reasonable. The music wasn't desirable but it's manageable.
August 31, 2013|Great sushi, too cheap prices.|4|"Nami is a beautifully appointed rest that offers valet. The menu had plenty of options to choose from for all types of eaters & while their wine list had some good, affordable selections it was far from ""the finest selection of wines on Federal Hill!"" as exclaimed on their website. The quality of the fish was outstanding. The rolls where huge and very creative, if overly so. They would be better if they had less ""stuff"" so the quality of the fish could shine through. My big take away from Nami was that is was ridiculously cheap. The rolls were enormous and all around $14. Two pieces of sashimi were about $3. I don't know how they're going to stay in business with that type of pricing structure so I'd go now before the place goes under."
August 30, 2013|delicious sushi, great presentation|5|We really enjoyed Nami - love the restaurant, the decor, the food was great and the presentation was wonderful. We ordered the sashimi plate and would definitely recommend it!
August 23, 2013|Sushi bento and platters beautifull|4|Sushi bento and platters beautifully presented. Refreshing salad though hidden cheese did not meet my dietary nor palate tastes. Extremely and attentive server.
August 17, 2013|Fantastic food!|5|Everything from the lemon meringue martini to the sushi to the main entrees were delectable! The best meal I have had in a long time! Absolutely worth the money!
August 10, 2013|Yummy sushi and nice atmosphere|4|It was a beautiful night so we sat outside. Inside was elegant, but we wanted to take advantage of the lovely summer evening. The sushi was fresh, yummy and creative. The best part was that they were able to make it with brown rice for a much healthier version!
July 27, 2013|Good sushi|4|Naomi is a very good resturant in a very vibrant neighborhood in Providence. The sushi is very good and the service is excellent. The restaurant is spacious and has a nice hibachi cooking section as well. We enjoyed our family time at Nami and would go back again for a future event.
July 27, 2013|Sushi Anyone?|5|This was my first time at Nami. The staff was very friendly from the moment we walked in. The atmosphere was great! We were seated at a booth next to the sushi bar. Although we didn't choose the hibachi seating, it looked really fun! The sushi was awesome (I'm really picky when it comes to sushi). I will definitely be back!
July 27, 2013|Great food and service!|5|"It was my idea to go to this restaurant with 5 of my friends, from going once before with coworkers. They loved it, loved the food and service. ""Good choice, Emi!"""
July 26, 2013|Loved it|5|Myself and my husband visited this restaurant on a Friday evening and it was fabulous. I was nervous because it is located on Federal Hill, which can be a bit hectic. However, once we got there it was really nice and fairly quiet. We made reservations for 6PM, so I cannot say how busy it would become if you waited until later in the evening, but 6 was nice enough to really enjoy our time. The wine was great, the food was delicious, and we will definitely be back again!
July 24, 2013|A great night|5|We visited Nami for a second time to celebrate my son's birthday. Our hostess, Wendy, went out of her way to make us all feel so special and to make sure our night was remarkable. It was our first time at the Hibachi table, which was both entertaining and delicious! We will recommend Nami to all of our friends and will be regulars there ourselves!
July 20, 2013|The restaurant is attractive|4|The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, the food and service very good.
July 12, 2013|Impressive Great Attn to Details|5|Made a last min res. for 4 ppl on a busy Friday night, had no idea what to expect. As soon as we opened the door, it was clear we had made a great choice. The ambiance was great, service a 10, and the details were so well thought out. Next time we come back, it will be with more people to hit up the hibachi!
June 22, 2013|Friendly Japanese fine dining|4|The service was very prompt and friendly. Our waitress gave good, genuine advice and paid great attention to us even though we were the only ones outside. The beef negimaki looked like it was alive but the first initial bites were juicy with teriyaki sauce. It was good but we'll try something new next time. My King's Throne roll was very good. I've never had sushi topped with chunks of lobster before. And her teriyaki chicken was very tender and juicy.
June 15, 2013|Sushi on Federal Hill!|4|Nami has beautiful decor. It was quiet on a Saturday evening @ 6. A basket of multigrain bread with 2 sauces arrived first, which seemed out of place at a Japanese restaurant. We shared the vegetable tempura appetizer, which was standard in terms of quality, taste, and size. We split a bottle of flavored saki, which was not worth the cost. We ordered several classic rolls, which were all very well made. The proportion and freshness of the ingredients was perfect. I would certainly go back if in the area and craving good sushi!
