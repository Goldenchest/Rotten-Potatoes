February 20, 2016|Yum!|4|Meal was delicious as always. Salad was great as was my cheese ravioli.
February 18, 2016|Another wonderful dinner.|4|We had dinner at Constantino's before a show at PPAC. Once again the food was very good and the service that Clayton provided was exceptional. He was our server that last time we were there and he has been consistently good.
February 14, 2016|Great service and delicious food|4|"We had a great Valentines at Constantino's. Food was excellent and our service was very attentive. My only negative would be the ""Manhattan style"" seating. They squish lots of little tables in so close that you can hear the quiet conversations of your neighbors. It wasn't that busy so I should have asked them to move us but my husband HATES to make a scene. It really was fine after all, but there were plenty of more private tables that others got to enjoy and we didn't. Next time I will speak up. Stairs to second floor might be a challenge to some."
February 14, 2016|Good food but uneven service|4|Been here several times and usually the service is better than this last experience, but it was busy for Valentine's day.

February 12, 2016|Love Constantino's!|5|"This wasn't our first time to Constantino's, we've been there many times and love it every time! The only thing that was ""slacking"" this time was some of the service.. I only ordered water to drink and their drinking glasses are rather small, so after some bites of burrata/prosciutto and arancinis to start, my glass was empty... and no one re-filled it until I asked for it half way through my dinner meal when I realized no one was paying attention to the guests waters, and really needed some more water... That was the only thing I can complain about. Everything else was great! Food is amazing! Will definitely be returning once the weather is nicer so we can enjoy their outdoor dining, too!"

January 30, 2016|Just as good as the first time..|5|My second visit to this restaurant, sometimes there is a letdown, after the first visit, not so here. The food was just as awesome this time and the service is impeccable. I will say that some of the tables are located in tight spots, but this isn't enough to take away from the great dinner.

Both were very good. The food was delicious! I had veal saltimbocca. Others had chicken saltimbocca, pappardelle bolognese, salad and pizza. For dessert, each couple shared the connolis as there were 2 on each order. The waiter was efficient and professional and attentive to our needs. Our experience was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or an evening on the town! Also, in warm weather, there is an outside patio area. We are eager to return to dine there when it gets warmer.
January 17, 2016|Federal Hill|4|Very nice Italian restaurant at DePasquale Square (the heart of Federal Hill in Providence). Great bread, wonderful homemade pasta (papardelle alla bolognese was superb). Good for a Sunday lunch as most other places in Federal Hill do not open on Sundays until or after 5pm. They also have a companion Italian deli on the other side of the plaza with cold cuts, sandwiches, salads and other items.

December 27, 2015|Not that great|3|"There was a ""cleaning agent"" smell to the place and the food was decent at best. My son's chicken parm was really bad--sub-par. I'd just stick to the deli next door."
December 11, 2015|Amazing experience|5|We had reservations for a party of eight for a birthday celebration and despite the fact that it is the holiday season we were seated right away and greeted immediately by our server. Our server, Steven, was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine suggestions. He treated us like family which was really nice considering the restaurant was very busy. We had the fried calamari appetizer with the sauce on the side (beware, it's spicy!) and a margherita pizza to share as well. Both were served quickly and piping hot. Calamari was light and crispy - so delicious! Our entrees were delicious ranging from gnocchi to chicken parm to veal piccata. Everyone raved! I had the lobster ravioli and my mom had the spinach linguine and both were exceptional. Dessert was an array of choices - cannoli, tiramisu and Nutella pizza. Nutella pizza is AMAZING and we had strawberries inside as an added touch and they were delicious. The only criticism for the night was that the coffee wasn't really hot but that actually worked out to be a blessing because we were all stuffed and warm by the end of the night. Truly wonderful experience had by all, making the birthday celebration extra special.
December 5, 2015|Low key Federal Hill restaurant|4|We have come back many times to this restaurant. The food is as good as the more expensive restaurants in the area. Most outstanding is the fresh pasta., I had pasta with white truffles and it was one of the best dishes I have ever had. Service is always excellent. Try to sit upstairs, it's drafty near the door.

November 8, 2015|Birthday dinner|5|My family and I celebrated my son's birthday & had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The antipasto was a great way to start off the meal & the server was excellent. Our dinners were great - grilled salmon and the chicken saltimbocca were very good. Definitely will go back when we are in Providence again.
November 7, 2015|First time here|5|This was a dinner out for my birthday, so I got to pick the place. I read some reviews before picking Constantinos, and made a reservation. We arrived on time, and sat right down. I will say right away that I was not delighted with the table we sat at, it was small and sort of in a doorway. I decided not to say anything, figured I would see how it played out. We were waited on right away, the waiter was great with specials and advice on ordering. After sitting for a little while, the fact that the table was in an odd place, seemed to matter less as there was not a lot of foot traffic in the doorway, other than our waiter, so not an issue. Our food was prompt, from apps to main dish, and excellent. I mean delicious, and that goes for everything we had. The prices are reasonable, I think it was $75.00 for the two of us, including drinks and an app. I will be eating here again, and not just on birthdays.
November 7, 2015|Great Italian restaurant|4|We had a late lunch/early dinner before Waterfire and it was just what we were looking for. Delicious bread, large portions to take home, and friendly service. With all the choices in Federal Hill, I would absolutely visit Constantino's again.

Noise wasn't bad, but actually almost too quiet. On the upstairs you can hear everybody, which leads me to believe they can hear us too. All-in-all it's not all that bad, I was just hoping for more to show my parents the Federal Hill experience. Definitely a spot I would just run into for a bite.

September 27, 2015|We had my birthday dinner at Costantino's.|4|We had a delightful dinner for my birthday. We were seated at an indoor table that was right by a door open to the outside, which was perfect. Our server was initially very attentive and fun, however, as the restaurant got busier his attention was diverted, so there were some long pauses when we didn't see him. The thing that spoiled the last half of our dinner was a very large group of high school girls at the table behind us. They were very noisy and loud. This group should have been seated in an area where they could have been isolated from other diners. Aside from the noise, and a somewhat inattentive server, the food was delicious, as always. Oh- my espresso wasn't hot.

September 18, 2015|Great spot for outdoor seating and people watching|5|Food at Constantino's is always a winner. We had early seating because we were going to a PPAC show, so we had our pick of outdoor tables. Only downside is we had to leave before the entertainment started in the Square.

The outside was blooming.... it was such a beautiful day. Meal was delicious. We did not feel rushed at all. Not one complaint from all 8 in our party. Amazing Thank you.

May 17, 2015|Excellent Italian|5|The food was outstanding and the white Sangria was delicious. We had a group aged from 21 to 70 and they all enjoyed the food and atmosphere. This place has a great outdoor dining area as well.

Food was delicious, I got the pizza con funghi that was surprisingly amazing and my girlfriends got various pasta dishes. All piping hot and generous portions, plus the complimentary bread basket for the table. Only complaint was our server.. He just wasn't very friendly. The busboy for our section was more helpful, talkative, and attentive than he was. Overall great food, but if there's a next time, we'll go next door to their bar area (which seemed a lot livelier) and hope not to be seated in Grumpy Pants' section if he's over there.
April 13, 2015|Really enjoyed our lunch, great outdoor dining|5|Food was great, service was also very good. Would highly recommend
March 28, 2015|Always consistent|5|I have a soft spot for Costantino's - on my first visit to Federal Hill, my friends and I were turned away at many restaurants since we did not have a reservation. Costantino's fit us in and gave us an excellent dining experience. I have been back several times since, and have never been disappointed. Food is excellent, likelihood to find something that appeals to you is highly likely with the variety of the menu, atmostphere is very pleasant and the waitstaff is top-notch!
February 23, 2015|Business DInner - Success|4|I had a business dinner here this week and the food was excellent as usual. They have a nice seection of wines and the app special was delicous. I had veal parm and it did not disappoint. Everything was excellent including the service. I would recommend this restaurant all day long.

January 31, 2015|Pleasantly Surprised|4|The food was good. The service and the staff were amazing. We had a great time with great friends. Will definitely be going back.
December 13, 2014|Holiday Gathering|5|Had an excellent time there Sat December 13th. Had a party of 9. Staff was helpful and friendly. Service and the food was excellent. They were very accommodating to our group. We're going to make it an annual event there. Thanks so much!
November 8, 2014|Love This Restaurant!!|5|We took my daughter here for her 30th Birthday. She had never been and she loved it! How can you not? The food is great, the staff is wonderful and very accommodating. We had the burrata which is made there and it was wonderful with great prosciutto. It's the best Italian food outside of Italy.

October 24, 2014|Pretty good buttoning special.|3|We have shopped often at Venda Ravioli's Deli, and also have enjoyed lunches, espresso, and gelato at the tables encircling the store. The Venda Bar & Restaurant was not particularly an improvement over the deli. Certainly, I don't think the added expense was worth it. Not that the food was bad. It just wasn't very special. For the same price, I have eaten better elsewhere both on and off Federal Hill.

September 24, 2014|Great lunch, good dinner...|3|I've done this restaurant for both lunch and dinner within a few months. Lunch was great, a real special treat in the middle of the day with hearty portions and a more formal feel for the meal. Dinner, on the other hand, felt good but not great. Food was still hearty, and they had some really good specials, but it didn't feel like a special night out. Can't really put my finger on it, think there might be better restaurants on the Hill for dinner, but think they do a great job at lunch. (Note, lunch is generally served across the courtyard at Venda Ravioli, but when they fill up and can't seat anyone else, they open the restaurant and you sit there.) Love Venda, food is amazing, but dinner was just good.
August 21, 2014|Good grilled pizza.|4|Pizza and Sangria were excellent. Chicken piccata, grilled swordfish, and chicken saltimbocca were good as well.music on the plaza on a Thursday night was great.
August 20, 2014|Great Spot with one complaint|4|I enjoy the outdoor atmosphere of Costantino's. The live music got a bit loud so I would request a seat further away next time. The food was very good. Federal Hill is the place to be for good Italian food. My complaint - I was there dining with a friend who I haven't seen in years. We were in the midst of a great conversation when the waiter came over to us and asked that we leave the table if we were through eating. He said there was a line of people waiting to get into the restaurant. That was a first for me. I've never been asked to leave my table because they needed it for other customers. I would recommend this spot only if you want to eat and get on your way.
July 30, 2014|Great food, ambiance, and service!|4|"Great spot to dine, especially in the Summer when they offer outdoor entertainment seven nights a week weather permitting. Special app. of Burrata, tomato and Prosciutto was superb. Nice pizzas, fresh pastas and excellent desserts! Good bartender in Frankie, Clayton was an attentive server, and Matt the busboy always had our water glasses filled. Attentive service without be ""stalked"". Great for people watching. Prices are reasonable, and portions are ample. A dining destination on Federal Hill."
July 25, 2014|One of my favs BUT NOT this time|3|We are regulars at this restaurant. This was such a weird experience we still can't believe it. Hostess was very sweet. We waited 20 min to just see our waiter K…n. Asked to order food at the same time as our first drink order.. WHAT?! After trying to not let all of the pushiness ruin our dinner (the entire dinner process) he told us there is a 2hr max for the table and we would have to leave soon so we have to order coffee/dessert at that time… ^^^^^head exploded^^^^^ Not only were we looking at EMPTY tables we did NOT hear or see this conversation happening at any other table around us.. Those patrons were still sitting once we were made to feel uncomfortable enough that we paid our bill and left..
July 24, 2014|Anniversary celebration|4|Outdoor dining on Historic Federal Hill. Still sat on plastic chairs but sat looking towards water fountain while live band played. Food was very tasty, all pasta made there. Server was pretty attentive. hard to hear each other at times.
July 6, 2014|I had made a reservation through open ta...|4|I had made a reservation through open table and received a confirmation via e-mail. Upon arrival the hostess did not have the reservation but was very accommodating in getting us a table within a short period of time. Although it was very busy our waiter did make an effort to meet our needs and checked on us periodically. Food was excellent. Loved the band that played Mike Dutra and singers. It was an excellent experience for an impromptu night!
June 19, 2014|Food-fun-music|4|There is nothing quite like sitting outside on Federal Hill listening to music and eating some good food. Venda Bar has a fun vibe with love music on the square and good traditional Italian food. My only complaint was that the server was in too much of a hurry to get us out of our seats. He never asked if we wanted another drink. Once our food was gone he cleared our plates and dropped the check. I certainly would have enjoyed another cocktail while listening to the live music but was never asked and felt rushed.
May 27, 2014|Delicious and worth the visit|4|Traditional Italian food and a wonderful setting. Great service. Reasonable prices! Finally a restaraunt that serves real Italian food, like we make at home. Definitely one of my favorites. Will keep going back.
May 17, 2014|Wonderful family celebration|4|Six of us came for lunch after my daughter's graduation from RWU. Ambience and service were great, the menu was fairly predictable (pizza, pasta, veal/chicken entrees) but everything was prepared perfectly. Appetizers (calamari, antipasto, clams) were all delicious. Extensive wine list means there's something for everyone and I was pleasantly surprised how affordable everything is. Definitely be back.
May 10, 2014|Dinner|4|Went for Mother's Day dinner, service was great, food was great, upstairs dining is a nice change from the venda bar downstairs, but their outside seating is the best. It rained on Saturday night so we couldn't take advantage of that but either way it was a nice night out.
May 8, 2014|Great choice before going to PPac|5|Had 6pm reservations on a Thur. Night, told our waiter we were going to PPAC for 730pm show. Our waiter Austin was great! Our party of 6 had plenty of time to enjoy great drinks and food! The arancini balls were the best I ever had! I also loved the eggplant rollatini, but everything was great! Looking forward to coming back and eating outside!
