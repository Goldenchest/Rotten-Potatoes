ays ago|Unique Tapas and Fun Dining at the Red Fin|4|The atmosphere at the Red Fin & Crudo is cheerful, vibrant, and full of zest. So is the choices on the menu. The tapas are great to share and the variety has ample choices for all types of diners. The service is attentive and our waiter had great recommendations as to how many tapas dishes we needed with three people. He was right on the mark. Each tapas provided great visual delight and made the palate come alive. Definitely Red Fin & Crudo will be on my list for dining in downtown Providence.

We had a reservation for Valentines day and were seated at a table in the bar right in front of the door, I would have appreciated having this information when we booked or when the reservation was confirmed. Some of our food was great (Shrimp ceviche in particular), but some of it was very salty and took away from plates that were otherwise well designed and delicious. Overall a mixed review - would recommend for a casual drink and bite to eat vs. a sit down meal.
February 14, 2016|Outstand foob and service.|5|This place is a great find. We will go there again. The food was great and good size servings. They took a little bit on one of the courses and brough us champion on the house. Great food, great service and reasonable priced. Thank you RedFin.
February 14, 2016|Shivering in PVD|3|It was ok... food was over priced but the service was good. My biggest complaint is it was freezing cold and they wouldn't let us move to another table. Was hard to enjoy the meal when you're shivering.
February 13, 2016|Pre VDAY Dinner|4|Tapas style menu and selection was great. Ceviche was good, not authentic, but with a good twist. Lamb chops were excellent. Paella was also very good, though a bit sweet. Surf & turf was good but for $47, was expecting a bigger portion of lobster tail, and beef was requested medium rare, and came out more medium well. The surf was more like a tiger shrimp, and the turf did not knock my socks off. Service was great and even though I made the error somehow in the system of reserving for Sunday, I got a call on Saturday while i was on my way, told them it should be for Saturday not Sunday, and they were very accommodating. Only 5 minute wait at door. Yes, I'd go back, enjoyed the ambiance. The industrial design & style was cool. Also enjoyed beer & bar selection. Carlos doncar1o@yahoo.com
February 13, 2016|Fantastic tapas|5|The best tapas my wife and I had since our visit to Spain.
January 14, 2016|Surprise stop|4|never heard of this place, saw it featured on restaurant week. Thought it would be a great time to try. The decor is simple and the food is comfort/fusion. We participated in the 4 course special which included conch ceviche, carrots, and lobster empanadas. Dessert wasn't memorable. But the food was fabulous so it didn't bother me.
January 12, 2016|Meh|2|"Went to Red Fin Crudo during Restaurant Week to try it out. After circling the block several times to find a parking space (no valet service in a busy part of the city), we saw a huge crowd outside the restaurant. Sadly, they were all waiting for the place next door. We went in and there was no host to be found. After a few minutes someone came by and I gave my name. He ran to the back to ""check the book"" and then suggested we sit in the bar area as the ""other room is going to be very loud, very soon."" We were seated near the front door in a hi-top table which was neither quiet, nor comfortable. The menu looked great, and we easily found things that sounded appetizing. When the food arrived, however, the conch ceviche was unseasoned and bland, the ""roasted"" carrots were crunchy, the lobster empanda was the size of a matchbox, and the chimichurri steak was tough and difficult to chew. There were other courses that I cannot recall, which were equally unmemorable. The noise from the bar was deafening, even on a Tuesday night, and it was a pretty unpleasant experience. Wait staff were courteous and friendly, but not enough to make me want to eat there again."
January 12, 2016|tasty!|4|tried the restaurant for the restaurant week special-had wanted to go there before but just hadn't gotten there-the service was youthful and friendly-the food very interesting in ingredients and flavors- -although all the dishes were good and who can argue with a warm cookie-my favorite dish was carrots! -would definitely go again
January 8, 2016|Creative food, wonderful service|5|The food is fresh and creative without being trendy. There are both small plates and full entrees, but it is most fun to share, since it is difficult to choose. There is some emphasis on shellfish, but it was not a strain for our non-shellfish eating friends to get a great meal. The service is excellent: attention without hovering.

The brussel sprouts were very good - and plentiful. The entree was a special - scallops with risotto, which was delicious. But our favorite dish was the mushroom polenta. The sauce was amazing - I wanted to lick the plate clean. For dessert we had cookies and ""milk"", which was actually an after dinner drink. I'm not sure exactly what was in the drink but it was delicious. The white chocolate and craisin cookies were served warm. The coffee was served in a french press, which ensured a fresh cup of coffee which was smooth and delicious. The atmosphere was friendly and lively. Our waiter was helpful, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere was friendly and lively. Don't expect a quiet, romantic dinner for two, especially when they are busy. Some of the tables are close together, so some patrons asked to be seated at another table, but we didn't mind the closeness and felt it added to the party - like feel. A great place to go with friends for a fun night out!"
December 11, 2015|Creative and Cool - Food and Atmosphere|5|Great casual atmosphere, creative and unusual menu items. We shared and tried a variety of choices. All were great.
November 28, 2015|Excellent Tapas Downtown|4|Went to Red Fin Crudo for a group lunch with 6 people. Loved the tapas menu. So great to share many different tastes. Full bar, with interesting cocktails and some good options for the craft beer drinkers. Great planning on the Raw Bar Sampler. The three available oysters were fresh and covered a diverse taste spectrum. Ceviche of the day was also very nice. Octopus was cooked absolutely perfectly. Iberico Ham was delicious. The Pork Belly melted in your mouth. So unhealthy, but so delicious. Oxtail Empanadas were tender with just the right amount of spiciness. Clams & Chorizo and Lobster Mac & Cheese got solid reviews. Service was just good. Appeared to be a little short staffed for lunch and our server was bouncing between bartending and table service. She knew the menu well and made great suggestions. It was slightly disappointing that rice for the Paella wasn't ready yet, but the quality of the Clams & Chorizo made up for that. On the pricey side for lunch, but well worth it.

We were not asked if we would like a second round of drinks. When a member of our table finally got his attention to order a second drink, he took their order and stormed off without asking if anyone else would like a drink. we were not offered dessert and our server started clearing plates that we were still working on!! The food was great, and we really enjoyed the tapas (especially the brussels sprouts!) and the oysters were also great.

November 13, 2015|Friendly staff and good food|4|We saw the great reviews on Yelp and decided to try it while we were visiting Providence. Overall the food was good (we had A LOT of oysters even though the shucking wasn't perfect) and we enjoyed chatting with the staff. The bar area was pretty loud and not very conducive to conversations.
November 6, 2015|Fell a little short but still good|3|The food was good but not fantastic (I had chicken & waffles). Service was very friendly and when half of our party's meals took much longer than the other part, they sent over some DELICIOUS shrimp cocktail and took something off the bill (without us asking!) which was a nice touch. Love the environment and the waiter was awesome so I would go back but I wouldn't get the chicken & waffles again.
November 6, 2015|Great new addition to the Prov food scene|4|Very interesting menu with small and large plates. Great drinks and nice bartenders and wait staff. Good choice for before PPAC....
October 31, 2015|Great meal and service|4|We really enjoyed our dinner. Our server was great and although the atmosphere is hip it was not at all pretentious. We struck up a conversation with the next table to discuss each others' choices. Everything we ordered was great-beet salad, spicy mussels, empanadas. We were staying at the Omni so it was an easy walk for us. We are thinking of relocating to Providence and will definitely go back.
October 21, 2015|Excellent small plates and absurdly fresh seafood!|5|Had been to Red Fin once before for lunch and was very impressed. The duck confit mofongo was a star amongst stars. This time went with a group of 9 and sampled almost all of the tapas. Incredibly, all (literally all) of them were absolutely fantastic! Calamari, croquetas, fried cheese, spanish ham (Iberico), brussel sprouts, lobster mac and cheese, were completely fantastic. The only thing that needs help are the drinks unfortunately. Maybe it was the sampling of the Halloween cocktail drinks (Jack Skellington, Dr. Franken-something) but they were not very good. Poorly balanced (overly sour) and did not do the amazing food justice. Stick with the classics (wine and beer) and enjoy some of the best food in downtown PVD and best tapas in RI!
October 17, 2015|Great food. Beer list needs work.|4|The tapas portions were generous and the dishes were well done and delicious. My only gripe as a beer enthusiast would be to have wider array of styles to choose from as well and multiple options within those styles..Otherwise a great experience.
October 10, 2015|Lovely!|4|My party of three truly enjoyed everything we ordered, and were very appreciative of the educated suggestions of our server. The room's acoustics allow for noise to travel quite well, but we were celebrating and so didn't mind. Loved the decor and atmosphere, loved the food and wine!

The empanadas and roasted carrots were full of flavor and were both something I would order again. They have a decent wine and beer selection. My only complaint is that I don't think a TV belongs in a nice place like this. It brought the ambience down a notch.
October 3, 2015|Great find!|5|We enjoyed the entire experience! The staff was so friendly. The food was delicious. And, the prices were very reasonable.
October 2, 2015|Fun, unique and tasty!|4|We ordered 5 different tapas and they were all great. The service and ambiance was good but the drinks could be better 4/5 stars.
September 19, 2015|Great new spot in Downtown Providence!  ...|5|Great new spot in Downtown Providence! We shared about 8 different appetizers and had some drinks, and we were all impressed! The Moroccan Meatballs and the Octopus were my favorite dishes for sure! Check this place out! You won't be disappointed!
September 18, 2015|Thumbs up!|5|Fun place. Menu is very diverse, something for everyone. Jacob was very attentive and informative providing excellent service! Would definitely return.
September 12, 2015|working out kinks, definitely worth coming back|3|We had reservations at 8:45 and the restaurant was jumping. The hostess seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. With clean open tables in the back the hostess made us wait and proceeded to clean a high top Duce at the bar and seat us there. The bar scene was fine for us until the AC vent started to drop all over our table (not much you can do about that on a warm night) Our server had high energy, very friendly and knew the menu inside and out. We ask for suggestions and they were all grand slams. We ordered a bunch of food and asked for our food to be coursed out. That didn't happen and with a small table, it filled up quickly. The food runners kept walking back and forth with plates not sure of where they needed to go and they brought plates to our table that we never ordered or already received. So either the runners don't know the table numbers or servers are putting the wrong info in, either way that needs to be fixed. The place is very hip and well appointed from floor to ceiling with good energy - they even had reruns of the Munster playing at the bar, loved that. All in all, The cocktails were delicious with well balanced flavor! The food is great with the prices being on point. The front of the house clearly know the menu but need stop running around like headless chickens. For a new restaurant, it's doing fine. A few minor tweaks, and they're set. We will be back very soon.

September 10, 2015|Order the bananas foster!|5|Went to dinner at Red Fin on a Thursday night, and split a few tapas with a friend. Each of the tapas we tried were phenomenal! Started with a cheese plate, and also had the tortilla espanola, pork belly and ham croquettes. Perfect amount of food for two people, we even had room for dessert. Thank goodness we did because the bananas foster was by far the best thing that we had all night! That says a lot since everything we had was great.
September 5, 2015|Came in with friends on a Saturday night...|3|Came in with friends on a Saturday night. We had an early reservation and were seated promptly. Decided to go with tapas dishes. Food is excellent. A nice variety. Brussels sprouts as good as the hype. The ham not so much. Wings pretty good and empanadas were also good. Has a mixture of speciality cocktails which were good but not exceptional. Service was hit or miss. Oysters served with hot plates, Brussels sprouts served with no plates. Will mature as this new place gets its groove. On plus waiter was enthusiastic and made recommendations.
August 29, 2015|Great tapas|4|Great and unique menu. We tried 3 different tapas and all were excellent . The chef certainly knows his stuff. We also met the owner as she walked through the dining area and she was great to chat with. A great addition to the Providence dining scene and a must try!
August 26, 2015|Fabulous|5|Red Fin Crudo is a great addition to the Providence dining scene and luckily it is within walking distance of where I live. Every dish I have had there has been wonderful and generally different from most other places in the city. Service has always been excellent. The only con is that almost all of the dishes are on the spicy side or and many contain a pork product so there are limited choices for those who don’t like spicy food or who don’t eat pork.
August 22, 2015|Excellent Service and Great Tapas!|5|I came here on a Saturday night in a group of 4. We were running late to our reservation, but the staff was extremely kind and understanding and seated us as soon as we got there. We had several tapas including the ceviche of the day (yellow watermelon topped with crab ceviche), octopus, picadillo empanadas, deviled eggs, clams and chorizo, duck confit mofongo, brussel sprouts, and the brownie for dessert. All of the savory dishes were truly incredible. The picadillo empanadas, which I thought was our most boring order on paper, ended up being our favorite. It was so perfectly crisp and tasty and everything you want an empanada to be. Second favorite was the clams and chorizo--that sauce was to die for, and I recommend asking for more bread to soak it all up. The duck confit mofongo was so delicious, but pretty rich. I loved how the deviled eggs had a wasabi thing going on with them. The only complaint about the food I would make is that our brownie was pretty dry. Perhaps we should have ordered the flan! ;) Regarding the ambience, the restaurant was casual, clean, and fairly quiet on a Saturday night, but I think all of downtown Providence is pretty quiet on Saturday night. The service was perfect. Couldn't ask for a better server, bartender, or host. After my friend had to change her drink order because the bar didn't have oranges for an old-fashioned, the bartender actually went to another restaurant to get one and make the drink for her. So nice! 100% recommend this place.
August 8, 2015|More misses than hits|2|We were surprisingly underwhelmed by our meal, especially given the stellar reviews of RFC online. We tried several tapas, vegetable dishes, and ceviche. The tapas were much larger and often more expensive than one would typically expect. While I suppose this might not bother some diners, I enjoy taking my time and sampling a lot of tapas; these were simply too big to try more than a couple. Numerous dishes come out with different accompaniments and garnishes than what was described by our waiter or on the menu--always a bit frustrating if you enjoy food and like to consider what you're going to eat. Multiple elements on multiple plates were also undercooked. Overall, I found the cuisine confused and more ambitious than successful. The wine list was interesting and good value, but the beer list (bottles and especially tap) was less exciting. Aside from the meal, service was pretty good, and the look of the restaurant is great. I'd possibly come to enjoy the raw bar, drinks, and the lively scene after work, but I don't think I'll return for another meal. There are just too many great places to eat in PVD.

July 14, 2015|Disappointing|1|I was so excited to dine at this restaurant given that I'm a Master Chef fan. Restaurant week offered the perfect opportunity for a visit. Some of the tapas were good - not great. The steak dish tasted like pot roast - I can make that myself. The expectation of what 2 cooking competition show finalists could produce was definitely not met.

It started off slow waiting for someone to take our order, but once they did it was worth it! We got to chat with one of the owners who really was hustling to keep things moving. She was a real delight. My friend and I shared the tuna tartare ( I'm a big fan ) we loved it, we also tried the papas bravas, delicious sauce was great, and lastly we had the empanadas which were really great! My friend loved her dark & stormy drink!
June 18, 2015|An Acquired Taste at Red Fin|3|"Red Fin and Crudo has an imaginative and different menu with some unusual items. Basically, this is a great place to share tapas and try the oysters, calamari, warm olives, and Iberian ham. The menu is inspired by Spanish flavorings and this was the first time I had ""warm Spanish olives"" with a very lemon-vinegar soak. We were two people trying Red Fin for the first time; service was very attentive; and the owner came by to explain the menu which was lovely. I found the food a bit salty for my taste and I would mention that the next time I go. There were more items (tapas -types) that would be fun to try with a group of people. The wine was lovely and reasonably priced. I look forward to going back to try it again."
