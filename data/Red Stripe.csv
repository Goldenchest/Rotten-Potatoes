ays ago|Lunch Break|4|Great food and good selection just noise level is very high!
ays ago|Noisy, but good food|4|I love Red Stripe for its consistently good food, but I always ask for a table away from the furor, as this can be a very noisy place, especially on a weekend night. Even with their new back room bar, the crowd around the bar in the front room becomes very energetic, so the tables near it are just not fit for conversation. The food is very good, though, and the menu a mix of trendy and inventive items and good old comfort food
February 23, 2016|Awesome as always|5|We tried to go to the Stripe a few times a month. Our kids are 5 and the menu for them is fantastic. Aaron's the best but all servers there are awesome.
February 22, 2016|Disappointing|2|Went with a business associate for dinner on a Monday when many other restaurants are closed. It was so loud in the dining room, we opted to sit at a high top table in the bar area. Less than satisfied with my dinner, our lovely and sweet server insisted I ordered a different steak. The second meal was so salty I could not eat it. My table mate admitted her dinner was also extremely salty - and we both really like salt normally - it was just way too much. This was my fourth visit to the restaurant and will also be my last. How many chances can you give a restaurant to get it right?
February 19, 2016|sand|2|3 of us had mussels as our meals. All 3 dishes were very sandy. 1 person in our group has fish & chips he said the fish was very dry. 1 child had steak (asked for well done) the outside was burnt and the inside was rare. The waitress never refilled our drinks. Poor service and the food was awful. We were very surprised.

February 12, 2016|Great Friends made the difference|3|This was my second visit to RS and the great company of friends and service provided by Danny were the high points. Moules Poulette et frites were disappointing and I was glad I didn't order the fish and chips my 3 companions did - just didn't look that good. Someone remarked that the fish was dry- presumably overcooked. Frites all around were room temp and limp. C'mon, guys. In 2016 there is no excuse for a full service bar to be out of Rye. Granted, they have an extensive beer and wine selection - diverse but not particularly impressive. I like to write positive reviews but felt this wasn't close to my first experience maybe 3 years ago. Seems like a popular spot - maybe they just had a bad night. That is everyone except Danny, who was attentive, accommodating, and just the kind of guy to take some of the sting out of an average meal when you're anticipating more. I'm not writing off Red Stripe but It won't be my first choice when I am in Providence again.
February 10, 2016|Very good enviroment, good meal, good service|4|Love the location, space and food. I will revisited when back in Providence!!

February 6, 2016|Giving up on Red Stripe|2|"We come to Red Stripe for the great food, and the service is usually tolerable. We were a party of 8 dining here for my boyfriend's birthday. We had a reservation, but it still took about 15 minutes to be seated. We waited for 15-20 minutes before our server came by and filled our water glasses. Then he disappeared and returned 10 minutes later to offer a cocktail. It took 15 minutes for those to even delivered. By the time we were sipping our first drink we were begging to order. We ordered a few appetizers, one being clams and mussels. We then ordered our entrees. Everything had been ordered for about 15 minutes before the waiter came over to tell us that they were all out of clams. I was highly disappointed, I came in that evening for the clams part of the dish. They brought out the mussels themselves on the house which was a nice gesture, but I am not a mussels fan. Finally we were served our entrees. I had two friends order the paella. They both complained it was salty. One of my friends told the server of the issue. The server took it back and I offered him my dish because I was full. Meanwhile, water glasses were empty, second drinks were difficult to attain. We brought our friends here to wow them with Red Stripe's food, and all were underwhelmed. The check came and my friends paella he sent back was still on the check. When we told the server of the issue, he said management told him they could not take it off because ""there were too many comps that night."" No manager ever came to the table to speak of any of the issues. I have worked in restaurants for years, and the issues I dealt with here show poor management. When wait staff does not care, 86ed items are not communicated, and a manager does not speak with a table about a problem, you can assure that there is a huge issue in this restaurant. My whole party remarked that they would not be back. That night I had an upset stomach, and my friend who I gave my dish to was sick all night! Beware of Red Stripe"
February 6, 2016|Delicious and great service|4|We were in a bit of a rush and the waitress was very cognasent of that. We got the mussels for an app and they were delicious. Nice and big and meaty. All of our entrees were delicious too. It is a pretty loud restaurant which was good for us as we were with a group and going to a concert. We really enjoyed and will be back.
February 1, 2016|Lunch at a favorite neighborhood restaurant|5|I take people to Red Stripe for lunch when they come to town. I'm never disappointed. I tend to order the same thing for lunch every time, but my friends order a wide variety of items from the menu and no one has been disappointed yet. Everything is fresh and prepared perfectly. We don't usually have wine at lunch, but I did have dinner there a year or so ago and as I recall the wine was excellent.
January 31, 2016|Love the restaurant. MUCH TOO LOUD|5|I (and many of my friends) do not frequent Red Stripes because of the extreme noise level. The food and service are excellent. The noise is horrific. One can't have a conversation.

January 30, 2016|Great find|4|This place has great food and a great menu for a variety of eaters. The mussels variety is fantastic and can be a meal.

January 24, 2016|NEVER DISAPPOINTED|5|A FAVORITE OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME AND CONTINUES TO BE
January 24, 2016|Great food for a great price!|5|Red Stripe is a great restaurant with great food and great service. Four of us were there and each ordered something different, and each of us had the perfect meal. The mussels are to die for! I have a burger and it was outstanding, charcoal broiled on the outside and moist on the inside with a delicious flavor!
January 23, 2016|This is a good traditional neighborhood ...|4|This is a good traditional neighborhood restaurant. The host and wait staff are consistently friendly and professional. The food is good, but lacking that something special in its presentation and ingredient combination. The menu could use a little updating although if you like old school options, this is your place. It's good on a cold winter night, hearty warm bread, onion soup and a nice wine list.
January 17, 2016|Brunch at Red Stripe|4|Overall good experience at Red Stripe. Our server was very good. The drinks were excellent. The food was good it did come out cold and my friend had asked for no onions and it came out with onions - they fixed both immediately and both ended up being very good. Ambiance was good. It was pretty cold by the windows so I would recommend a sweater!
January 16, 2016|Second Class Diners|1|We had a reservation for 6:30. When we arrived there were several open tables on the makn dining floor. We were seated in an alcove containing two very close sets of tables next to the kitchen door. It was very awkward sitting, ostensibly, with another couple ( they were young and appeared to be on a date). The space was also very tiny, I had my back to the room so I couldn't ever see out server as he was taking out order and the traffic coming and going from the kitchen was awful. I felt like we were being hidden away because we were a. An older couple b. Not who the restaurant would like to see as their customer base. The experience was awkward and uncomfortable. We have been dining at the restaurant for several years but will be very hesitant to return after being treated as second class citizens. It would seem that folks with reservations should be given preferential seating.
January 15, 2016|Fun time out with a friend!|4|I met up with a friend for dinner at Red Stripe last Friday night, during, what turned out to be, Restaurant Week. It was very busy and a bit noisy, but we were tucked away in a corner, so it was fine. Food was really good. I cannot stop thinking about the Apple Hand Pie for dessert. AMAZING!
January 15, 2016|Still undecided about this place|3|Tables are MUCH too close together. I am have no interest in my neighbor's conversation, as I am sure they have none in mine. And, getting bumped and jostled each time the person behind or next to me moved or got up was frustrating. Side salad was huge, dressing left me looking for flavor and the salt shaker. Burger was cooked properly on the inside, but was burnt/charred on the outside. Server was pleasant and not intrusive.
January 9, 2016|Great little find in a great neighborhood|5|The food and service each time we return can't be beat. The seafood paella is delish!!!
January 7, 2016|Always reliable, good food!|4|We stopped for dinner after my grand daughter's basketball game and had a favorite, modules and frites! Food and service always good.
January 2, 2016|The good, the bad and the...|3|The positives: the food is quite good and the wait staff is well meaning. The negatives: The noise level in the restaurant on a Saturday night is too high and detracts from the ambience. Too many hard surfaces with no apparent design to absorb and attenuate the noise. We arrived a few minutes earlier, and though a table was available, the hostess declined to seat use immediately. We had to remind the hostess to seat us and then she indicated we needed to have our whole party present--this was unreasonable, especially since we had older people in our party and continuing to stand was uncomfortable. I should not have had to point this out to the hostess. The wait staff appeared a bit overwhelmed in getting the food to the table. Wait staff rush around so quickly that it feels at times that there's an indoor track meet going on.

December 31, 2015|Great NYE dinner|5|Had the short rib bourguignon. Cooked perfectly, meat fell off without at knife. Large portion of mashed potatoes and excellent brussel sprouts. The fries make a good appetizer as they are hand cut. And the flourless chocolate cake was almost as good as the coffee ice cream on top. Would go again.

December 29, 2015|Hands down my favorite spot in providence|5|Excellent service, food, and ambiance. What more could you ask for?
December 26, 2015|Mediocre in Wayland Square|3|Looking for a place to dine out and ignore the remaining holiday leftovers, my parents suggested Red Stripe by Wayland Square. Both my parents had previously been and enjoyed the experience, so I took their word for it and made a reservation for three on the Saturday after Christmas. When we arrived, the restaurant was about halfway full, and remained that way when we left about and hour and half later. The menu was extensive, and as pescatarian along with two omnivores, there were plenty of options for us. I debated between the mussel dishes and the scallops and shrimp, but the latter won out because of the accompanying butternut risotto and my affection for the rice dish. My dad ordered the Cobb Salad, which arrived bountiful and gorgeous, including a half of a sliced avocado and hard boiled egg. Mom went with the fish and chips, which arrived crispy, but not greasy. The fries were shoe-string and came in abundance. When my dish arrived, I was surprised by the large portion size of the risotto. There were three caramelized scallops and three sauteed shrimp. The scallops were well cooked, but the shrimp were slightly overdone. Despite being most excited for the risotto, I found it unenjoyable. It was rather gummy and lacked salt, so much so that I had to shake a few rounds of the salt shaker on in order for me to find it at least eat it. Making it only slightly more tolerable was the lightly dressed arugula on top that added an acidic bite to the risotto. The texture of the rice suggested that it had been sitting in a pot for a while. Most risottos usually have cheese added once finished, but the lack of salt in this one suggested to me otherwise. Perhaps this was because the risotto was paired with fish, but even so, the dish as a whole suffered. The only redeeming quality for my meal was the freshly served bread that each of us received upon sitting down. I ate another piece at dinner to make up for the unsatisfactory dish in front of me.
December 24, 2015|How the mighty have fallen....  Despite ...|1|How the mighty have fallen.... Despite numerous requests via phone calls, phone messages, opentable, and even a specific request to the greeter when our party arrived, we were seated at a table not at all like what we needed. A significant disappointment....and for what it's worth; I've spend several thousand dollars at Red Stripe over the past few years.
December 23, 2015|Christmas Get-together|4|I chose Red Stripe for a Christmas get-together with my nephew, his wife and their two daughters who were in town from Georgia for the holidays. The menu had something for everyone and we reserved a table in the back so it wasn't as noisy as the front room so we were able to chat and catch up. The waiter was very attentive and was very accommodating. I would most certainly return!
December 18, 2015|A great spot! Affordable prices for great food!|4|The ambiance and energy of a diner, but has great options for foodies, is very affordable, and has a wonderful menu. Great for a special occasion, too, if the energy suits you (which is does for me and my husband). Red Stripe is one of our fav spots on the East Side!
Dined on December 13, 2015|brunch|4|found that this was a good spot to have a group for brunch-enough variety on the menu, great service, good prices and good location
December 12, 2015|This was my 2nd time here. The 1st time ...|5|This was my 2nd time here. The 1st time I sat in the main dining area. It was loud but enjoyable. The 2nd time I sat in the back room. Not as enjoyable. That aside the food both times was fantastic. Portions were good; really a bit large. Food was hot and came out timely. The dessert I had the 2nd time was not so good. Gingerbread with cranberry compote and cranberry sorbet. Very sour and the gingerbread was overcooked so it was dry. Wouldn't recommend that but the eggnog Panna cotta was delicious! Definitely recommend the restaurant.
December 6, 2015|Promising menu leaves diners disappointed|2|We ate with family of four on a Sunday evening. Pleasant and fun enough to sit in a booth but it took almost 30min for us to get a menu and our drinks. We had to ask several times for bread which only arrived after the appetizers. Really, though, it was the almost inedible level of the food that disappointed. The bread tasted metallic (no idea how that could be). Mussels were dry in a flavorless broth. Salads way overdressed with coyingly sweet dressing and too sweet covered nuts. Brownie sundae was too dry. Steak meat tasted funny. And this is all feedback from two adults and two pre-teens who generally like food, particularly basic pasta and steak frites. Too bad.
December 6, 2015|overall pretty good|4|I had the short rib, and my friends got steak frites and shrimp and scallops. The food isn't the best in the neighborhood, but it's still pretty good. A little salty for me. We also had mussels for appetizer and it was really good.
December 6, 2015|Do something about the noise.|3|I go relatively often to Read Stripe. The food and prices are excellent and the service is quite nice, although occasionally it can be less than ideal. If I visit this restaurant less it is because I find the noise level in the place unbearable. It is worse than being in a plane or a train station. I need to scream for anyone to understand what I am saying, and even screaming it is difficult to communicate. For example, the last time I was there (for a Sunday morning brunch), the server did not hear our request for two mimosas. I stopped going for dinner there because at night the noise is even worse. And if you have some problem in your voice or your hearing, forget bout it entirely, or you'll suffer through the meal.
December 5, 2015|My Go-To French Bistro|5|Red Stripe in Wayland Square is my local go-to French bistro. Love everything about it.
December 5, 2015|Fun Night|5|A perfect restaurant to meet up with old friends and enjoy a leisurely delicious dinner. The service was lovely and the food excellent. Thank you for all of your patience!!!!
December 3, 2015|terrific|5|Great food and prices. Red devil pasta highly recommended. Lots of vegetarian options
November 30, 2015|Great lunch|5|Cobb salad was fresh. Chowder was very tasty. Great lunch. Eager to return.
November 29, 2015|Disappointing|3|We were there early evening the Sunday after Thanksgiving so it was not that busy. We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to the table to greet us and provide water or take our drink order. There were lots of smiling service people passing by-my husband was just about to ask if this table had been assigned to anyone. Also, the restrauant has terrible acoustics -an incredibly noisy restrauant. Once we had our server, the service was ok. The pace of the food coming to the table was poor and then we had to request coffee and a desert menu. There were 4 of us dining. With so many excellent restrauants in Providence-this one is off my list.
November 29, 2015|A Very Good Brunch|4|I visited this restaurant on the recommendation of my son who once lived in Providence. I was not disappointed with the food or the warm atmosphere. The wait staff was great and the food choices ranged from familiar to exotic. I expect to return for future meals when in the area.
November 28, 2015|We came back...|5|This was our second visit and we were just as pleased if not more so as compared to our first visit recently. The food was awesome as all 4 of us in the group enjoyed our cocktails, dinner and wine. We will make sure we return the next time we are in Providence or nearby.
November 24, 2015|Catching up with an old friend|4|The food was delicious. Our waiter was not as attentive as I would have liked. It's a great spot but it is noisy.
November 22, 2015|A favorite restaurant|5|We love the Red Stripe for its excellent fare. For example, the onion soup is true French style. Brunch is always good too.
November 21, 2015|Great 1st visit for us and the kids|4|Great time at Red Stripe. Hadn't been there before, in fact, didn't even know that neighborhood existed, having only dined pre-Brown hockey games in the Thayer St area (We're from west of Boston.) Food was great, service was good. The kids ate well and the 7-yr old announced we need to come back to Red Stripe for dinner for every future hockey game. Really a good find and we'll be back.
November 15, 2015|Sunday brunch|4|Had to return for another Sunday brunch as couldn't wait to try bread pudding French toast. Loaded with fresh berries and real maple syrup, it did not disappoint. One diner thinks the home fries here are the best she's ever tasted, and her sunny-side-up eggs were cooked just perfectly. Our other companion was very happy with Red Stripe's Bloody Mary cocktail. Only complaint would be the size of coffee cups for a brunch. Poor waitress had to keep coming back with both pots, regular and decaf, as the small cups' servings just seemed to evaporate!
November 13, 2015|A Gem|5|My hisband always look forward to dining at Red Stripe. Consistently great! Love their Fish & Chips.. Best anywhere. Friendly and efficient wait staff.
November 11, 2015|Good food at reasonable prices|4|The red stripe grilled cheese was good, ziti with meatball was not too bad either. The place was very busy for lunch and we could understand why. Service was good, food was good and prices were reasonable for lunch.
November 7, 2015|Hot place, cold food.|3|"Our third visit. The first two times were incredible, This time, on a busy Saturday night, my wife Elizabeth was served a veggie burger that was ice-cold in the middle. The horrified and apologetic waiter offered to replace it and make amends. By then, I was nearly through my meal and she didn't want a replacement. The waiter was great...he offered dessert on the house. (Which she politely turned down...not much an eater of sweets.} When the bill arrived, we were not charged for the burger or for the appetizer we had previously ordered. I look at it as a case of ""things happen"" and commend the waiter and the restaurant for stepping up to the plate and doing their best to correct the mistake. We'll go back..."
November 4, 2015|Great lunch!|5|Always love Red Stripe for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Their mussels and frites are one of my favorite dishes--sometimes I crave them. Definitely recommend dipping the crunchy sourdough in the mussels broth for complete decadence. Good servers, nice atmosphere, consistently good food at reasonable prices.
November 2, 2015|Loved our meal|5|Loved the bread, the food, the waiter, the ambiance and did I mention the bread?
November 2, 2015|This is one of my favorite restaurants i...|5|This is one of my favorite restaurants in Providence, the food is always good and the service is always on point. I never have a complaint when I visit this restaurant. The Steak Frites is amazing the best I've had and I've been to France several times. The steak is always cooked perfectly and the Gorgonzola Butter goes so perfectly with it. The burgers are also amazing they are 10 Oz's of flavor on a bun, this burger is well worth the trip and.
November 1, 2015|Awesome|4|Red Stripe is consistently awesome, the food is always well prepared and the staff is great, I love dining here, always a pleasure!! (the brunch offerings are also awesome)
October 31, 2015|The chicken parmesan was so overcooked a...|2|The chicken parmesan was so overcooked as was the pasta . My husband said the frenchfries were good but not the steak,. we have been to Red Stripe many times .it was my birthday and had always enjoyed the dessert. I ordered flourless chocolate cake. Do you have any professional chefs working any more?
October 31, 2015|First time with the new Fall menu.  Seas...|4|First time with the new Fall menu. Seasonal entrée of pumpkin ravioli very tasty. Crab encrusted cod also very tasty. Still miss the clams and linguini but the waitress mentioned the kitchen could still come up with the dish if we asked for it.
October 30, 2015|Small, But Special!|4|We have been here with large groups, small groups and just the two of us and we have always had great food. Red Stripe is small(ish), busy and loud, but the food is good with an open kitchen and an eye for the comfortable. Their mussels and frites are fabulous, but so is everything they do! Don't be afraid to try something new, or a new twist on an old favorite- my husband loves the meatloaf! A small restaurant with big flavor!
October 30, 2015|Molly was a wonderful waitress.  She was...|4|Molly was a wonderful waitress. She was attentive and had a smile.
October 30, 2015|Ups and downs|3|The food portions were great and food delicious. Service could use work. Waiter didn't check back on us often enough, many times needed a refill and couldn't get our waiters attention. Ordered desert and desert came withoit any new silverware so had to sit and watch as our ice cream melted on our cookie pie and brownie pie (or something like that) until got another waiters attention. She was very helpful. Noise level wasnt desirable. Guess it was because it was packed that night good thing to have a reservation.
October 24, 2015|Pumpkin Raviolis Fit for a Queen|5|If you're looking for a quiet dinner for two, this isn't the place for you. If you want to be where the dinner party is, then reserve a table at Red Stripe. The food and service were great. My only issue was the $50 gift card - it rang through as a rewards card instead of taking $50 off our bill. The GM did not come over to rectify or address the issue.
October 24, 2015|Great find!!|5|Cocktails were great as were appetizers (Portuguese mussels) and entrees, we will certainly come back when next in town!!
October 22, 2015|Mussels are a MUST|4|You can't walk into Red Stripe without trying one of the mussels dishes! My boyfriend and I have been going here regularly and have finally tried every single mussel option. None of them have disappointed us! We are trying to figure out our favorite and have started ordering two different sauces each time we go.
October 18, 2015|Always great service and fantastic food,...|5|Always great service and fantastic food, something for everyone. Brought the family this time. They loved it.
October 18, 2015|Fine but nothing special|2|This was the second time I had eaten brunch here and it was fine. The eggs were fine. The potatoes were fine. The grilled artisan bread was burnt. I sent it back and the replacement was burnt as well but this time only on one side. Too many other choices around to return here.
October 17, 2015|A Great Rhode Island Restaurant|4|I was making a visit to Rhode Island from New Jersey. I looked up restaurants and decided to attend Red Stripe due to its menu and the photos in the gallery. I made a reservation and was on my way (three days later). When I got there it was a bit noisier than expected. It was quite loud. I assume that I was the only one taken aback. My date and I were seated in the closest table to the door leading to the kitchen. This was a little surprising to me seeing as I made a reservation. I would have assumed I would have had better seats. In any event, I ordered a bottle of White Zinfandel which was good. My date loved it. I also ordered a flatbread pizza as an appetizer. For me, there was a little too much cheese and not enough crust. Despite this, it was not bad. For my main course, I ordered a pasta dish that came with vegetables as I am a vegetarian. As usually is the case when I dine out, I wish there would have been a little more vegetables. The pasta was cooked 90% too perfection which is saying a lot coming from me. The flavors were great. Overall, I had a good experience here. I would recommend it to other people. It is hard for me to be pleased so do not take this review to harshly. I enjoyed my time here and would come back.
October 16, 2015|Parent's Weekend Experience|2|We ate there on Friday night of a Brown University parent's weekend. We had reservations, but were slow to be seated and were slower to be served. It took 30 minutes to get menus (they said they were short of menus) and 45 minutes to order our first drinks. The food was good when it arrived, but we were late for our evening campus commitments. The restaurant was under staffed, and the staff they had was under trained.
October 14, 2015|Awesome!|4|As always, Red Stripe was awesome! I especially appreciate that their french fries are gluten-free friendly as they are cooked separately...thank you!
October 10, 2015|Great food! My only complaint was our pa...|4|Great food! My only complaint was our party of 8 was crammed around a round table. Tight fit as we had five big men/teenagers. Will definitely go again however!
October 9, 2015|Great for date night!|5|My boyfriend and I went on Friday evening for a date night and Red Stripe couldn't have been more perfect! I got the famous grilled cheese, absolutely delicious, and my boyfriend got steak frites, also delicious. We started with the calamari which was spicy but very good. Overall, Red Stripe is a must for anyone who is in Providence.
October 7, 2015|Fast-paced, but good quality.|3|I have been to this restaurant several times now and the quality of food is good, but not so distinctive that I would recommend going out of the way to visit. The service is good, but a little rushed. They really try to move patrons along, so it is not a place to simply relax and have a long leisurely meal with friends or family. The pricing is appropriate for the quality. The ambiance is busy, a little noisy and not suitable for a private or intimate meal. If you want to have a good meal at a good price and not spend all night waiting for your food, then this is a great place. But for those who want a slower paced relaxing meal with friends, it is probably not as suitable.

Dined on October 3, 2015|Get the moules and frites.|4|The lunch menu has TEN mussels options -- all large and juicy and served with salty and crispy frites. We sampled the Billi Bi and the Mouclade and loved them both. My college-aged son also gave his burger a thumbs up.
October 2, 2015|Great Spot near Brown Univ Campus|5|Great food, regional menu with lots of options Food well prepared A cool location tucked into a family neighborhood on College Hill Sister restaurant to Mills Tavern near the river
September 28, 2015|Recommend by Chef|4|We ate here based on recommendation made by acclaimed local chef. Had a good experience. Well prepared , beautiful food. Appealing menu. Had lobster roll which, while common local fare, was a treat for us because we come from the Midwest. We would definitely return.
September 27, 2015|Our first time trying their brunch and c...|4|Our first time trying their brunch and can't wait to return to try the bread pudding French toast! Omelets were very good as was the benedict dish our companion ordered. A little skimpy on coffee cup size for a brunch, though. Portions were just the right size, and home fries were some of the best we've ever tasted. Also could use a little jam with the artisan bread.
September 27, 2015|Must have been an off day...|2|We have been going to Red Stripe for years. We could always count on great food, great ambiance, and a dedicated staff. But my wife and I went for brunch on Sunday it seemed that Red Stripes best days were behind them. Our waiter was punctual and friendly and quickly took our order. I ordered the Salmon Benedict and my wife had the pulled pork Benedict. My meal was good but my wife's poached eggs were over cooked and like rubber. We had trouble getting our waiter's attention for more coffee as he and many of the other servers were chatting at the bar. I had to get up and get him. All in all, not worth the drive to Providence. I always thought of Red Stripe as a premier Rhode Island eatery, but last Sunday morning Red Stripe wasn't doing any better than IHOP.
September 26, 2015|Upscale American food with a great atmosphere|5|Love Red Stripe, found this place in college and it is my favorite place to go in Providence. It has a great upscale american food menu. Food is not pricey for how good it is. They specialize in mussels a bunch of different ways - a must try if you go there. Vibrant scene that is always busy and lively. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
September 16, 2015|Fresh ingredients.  Good service.  Nice atmoshpere|5|Had lunch with a friend. She had the hanger steak with yummy french fries. I had the Margherita flatbread, which was dee-lish!!! Will definitely go back soon.
September 11, 2015|Caesar salad nicely split for 2 to share...|4|Caesar salad nicely split for 2 to share. Flatbread nice and crispy, delicious topped with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Perfect size for 2 to share.
September 5, 2015|Decent food, reasonably priced...|4|Maybe it's the location, but this Red Stripe seems better all around than the East Greenwich restaurant. In any case, the food is not gourmet quality, but good enough, well presented, and plentiful. I'd recommend the steak frites.
September 5, 2015|7 of us went to red stripe before a conc...|5|7 of us went to red stripe before a concert. I have been there many times eating at the bar but never with a lg crowd at a table. The service was spot on and the food was delicious. We are a group of picky foodies and I was hoping everyone would be as impressed with the food and delicious hand crafted cocktails as I - and they raved. The ambiance is very bistro like with the sm tile floors but a little loud with all the hard surfaces. It sure has a loyal neighborhood following as I see repeat customers who are recognized by friends and staff. So good it makes you want this gem in your own neighborhood.
September 4, 2015|Red Stripe Does it Again!|5|We love this restaurant and it is yet to disappoint. The food is very good and the atmosphere is outstanding with a lively, vibrant feel. I told someone recently that it is our new favorite place.
September 2, 2015|They like your dog!|5|We took our small Maltese here for lunch and the wait staff was very supportive, offering her water, treats and providing overall a very welcoming experience both for our dog and her owners!
September 1, 2015|Usually great, but not tonight.|2|Typically love Red Stripe, but went on a Tuesday night and they were frantically busy. Service was poor and food was substandard. If this was my first visit, I'd probably never go back, but since I've got history, I'd be willing to try them again and hope it was a one-time fluke.
September 1, 2015|Not the best visit but pretty good.|3|"We've eaten here many times and this wasn't the best visit we've had. Overall, the food was good but not great. The restaurant was really busy for a Tuesday evening. When we arrived with a reservation for 4 people at 6:30pm we had to wait about 10 minutes for our table to be ""set up"" which was strange because there were several other tables for 4 clearly empty and already set up in the main dining area that we were not seated at. After a wait, we were finally seated at a table in the back room of the restaurant. Next, our server was really not having a very good night. He seemed over-extended and also a little confused at times. I had decided to try something I hadn't ordered before, which was the flounder in parchment. It was cooked nicely (moist, not overly dry) but it was a little bland. The lentils that came with it were quite tasty though. I will probably go back and hope for a better experience, but this particular night was kind of off."
August 29, 2015|Great food at great prices!|5|Our first visit to Red Stripe will not be our last. Our entrees were delicious, and all were under $20. There is a varied list of mussels and fries. The Mouclade was quite good. The restaurant is busy and energetic, so request a window table. The windows were open, and it was a lovely place to sit. You can also sit outside at a table for 2.
August 29, 2015|Classy without being snooty|5|"Our New York City friends said, ""I wish there were a Red Stripe in our neighborhood."" Really! Good food, fair prices, lively but not chaotic and superb service on a very busy Saturday evening."
August 29, 2015|Happy again!|4|Once again great food and drinks at Red Stripe. Just a bit more checking with us would have earned 5 stars - just once more really. Although we quickly got the extra spoon we requested for the risotto croquettes. We haven't had a bad meal - more moules, frites, and beef stroganoff please. For our (3rd) visit we requested and got a table not in the center of the restaurant. FYI - this is where families in the neighborhood come with their kids, it's loud...but yummy.
August 23, 2015|Continues To Thrill|5|Anytime I go to Red Stripe I am pleasantly rewarded with great food and service. I didn't think it could get better and this past visit blew myself and three friends away, for brunch. I can honestly say that you can order anything on this menu and you will love it. Fresh food is the key here along with qualified chefs who know how to balance flavors and textures. Customer service is constantly up to par with the higher end restaurants leaving you wanting for nothing. Enjoy!
August 22, 2015|Food|3|my chicken was dry...and poor quality...my wife's pork tenderloin was good
August 22, 2015|Professional Friendly Service|4|Great service, and knowledgeable server staff. We were first seated near the kitchen and it was my mother's 70th birthday and she has trouble hearing and it was a bit noisy so I quickly asked the hostess if we could be moved which she completely accommodated. We were moved to the back room where it was much quieter and easier for us to have quality birthday time.
August 14, 2015|smarter now|4|my hubby and I enjoyed date night at Red Stripe. we loved everything except our table we were not aware that if u reserve early enough, u can reserve a specific table or area we're smarter now and will definately enjoy another date night at the Red Stripe!
August 7, 2015|"Food and service were good. 
Very loud."|3|Food and service were good. Very loud.
August 5, 2015|Service was Weak|3|The hostess was unfriendly and tried to seat us at a tiny back table. We successfully switched tables after waiting a while. The waiter was decent but food delivery was very slow, even with a half empty restaurant. My guest received a salad with a beautiful piece of salmon. I ordered a blue burger and received a bacon burger. Too much hassle to return, especially since it took so long to arrive. Red Stripe was off its normal good standard.
August 1, 2015|Great food and friendly place to go with family|5|Great food and friendly place to go with family and friends. Great muscle dishes. The tomato soup is fabulous as well as the grilled cheese.
August 1, 2015|Service was lackluster and rude the food...|1|Service was lackluster and rude the food was cold and tasteless, overpriced for what you get which was a burger that was burnt to a brick
July 31, 2015|Great!|5|Excellent service and excellent food! Great experience!
July 24, 2015|My meal was delicious. I've never had a ...|5|My meal was delicious. I've never had a bad meal or experience here. My only complaint is that they got rid of the Molten Lava Cake. The flowerless chocolate cake was tasty but I could have done without it. New party chef, the lava cake was a sell out. Which means it's popular, don't change something that's worth it. Your substitute wasn't.
July 21, 2015|UNBEARBLY LOUD|1|Not even the best food (which Red Stripe has) is enough to lure me back to this restaurant where I suffered the unbearable rumble of LOUD NOISE during lunch at the off hour of 2 pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant should put some thought and money into sound baffles. Ruined an otherwise stellar dining experience
July 14, 2015|Not a good place for conversation|4|Red Stripe is one of my favorite restaurants because of the food, but I made the mistake of taking a number of guests there for dinner. The noise level was such that we had to raise our voices to talk to one another. I got hoarse and finally gave up. At lunch I usually go with one friend and we sit in the back in a booth where it is quieter. The NOISE, however, does not seem to cut into their business.
July 12, 2015|A great find|5|I recently visited Red Stripe for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. Brunch both times was excellent - good variety on the menu, good tasting food, especially the bread. Great ambiance - sat by front windows, open as it was summer - nice breeze, fairly quiet conversations. Good I really like this place.
July 3, 2015|Great food and atmosphere. The Duck Conf...|4|Great food and atmosphere. The Duck Confit is superb.

June 29, 2015|Good Food and Nice Seating|5|Good food, I had the burger. We got seated right at the large windows in the front which were open. Very nice.
June 22, 2015|Great, local find|4|I came to Red Stripe at a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. The prices are very reasonable. Our server spilled (lots of) water and crashed into things a few times, but otherwise, we had a lovely experience.
June 19, 2015|Outstanding, cannot wait to go back|5|We stopped in for lunch on a Friday to celebrate our anniversary. The menu was comfort with a nice twist and the food was astonishingly good. We started with the olives and hummus plate which was wellbalanced and excellent. I had the moules-frites and my husband the bacon cheddar meatloaf sandwich, both of which were exceptional. Doubly so for the moules frites, which are a ridiculously good value and have become one of my favorite foods. The noise level was very, very loud, it was hard to have a conversation, but otherwise it s an attractive setting. The service was outstanding - our server was PERFECT! Also, we got our food very quickly, but not too quickly, perfect pacing. An outstanding experience, we have plans to go back. The reservation service online was great and I highly recommend making a reservation, this place is hopping!
June 13, 2015|Eclectic and Diverse|5|Awesome menu! So many great items to chose from. We shared a Lobster roll for an appetizer and had a spinach and Watermelon salad with whipped feta that was delicious. I had Paella for dinner it was the best I have ever had. The dry Spanish Chorizo was excellent as was all the shellfish and fish. The candied carrots, celery, and onions made the dish very unique. Need to go back and try the grilled cheese with pear and a couple of the burgers. Overall, a GREAT place for foodies!!
June 13, 2015|Great way to start a special night|5|I was bringing a guest to the Red Stripe for the first time. I had always enjoyed my time. I was unsure about the Paella and some of its ingredients. My server was excellent in its description on how it looks and will taste and he was very convincing. When my food came I was not disappointed. I just added another favorite dish to my list to make it even harder to decide what to order. :) Thank you again
June 12, 2015|Never Disappoints!|5|Red Stripe is always spot on - the food and service is consistently excellent. The menu is so varied, no matter what you're in the mood for, it will satisfy. I average a meal there about once per week for both work and personal meals. The salads, mussels, sandwiches, steak, everything is excellent! Also, try the sangria - it's not too sweet and strong!
June 10, 2015|Wdnesday night|4|Arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated right away without an issue. Our server was very friendly and attentive. There were several vegetarian choices on the menu. Our meals came out quickly. Everything was great. I look forward to going here again and trying another tasty dish
June 10, 2015|Food is always good and service is excellent .|4|Have gone here for lunch and dinner. Always reliable and excellent food and service. Looking forward to trying brunch!
Dined on June 7, 2015|Always a pleasure!|5|Great food, great service and as usual a great time !
June 5, 2015|First Visit to Red Stripe|4|Great restaurant for a group celebration. We had a party of nine and were seated in the back room near the bar which was perfect for conversation as it was less crowded and quieter than the front. About half of our group really enjoyed their food, while a few people just found the food to be average. Overall, Red Stripe was very accommodating for our group and the service was excellent.
May 25, 2015|Great food at a great price|4|This is the third time we have been here and each time I am impressed by the quality of the food for the price. The server was new so timing was a little off but she was trying hard and it showed. Food was great ( Beef Stroganoff ) but expect a loud and raucous atmosphere, not a quiet intimate dinner by any means and with the very small venue reservations are a must at peak times. Most dishes are at or under $20.00 so dinner for two and a couple of drinks can be very reasonable, we will be back!
April 26, 2015|Great Food Service needs help.|4|If it was not for the Food this place would probably get a 1 star. First i took my wife here for our Anniversary because it had good reviews. First we Sat down and waited for almost 20 min for our waitress to even approach us she was to busy having a conversation. When she did finally approach she was not very warm or welcoming at all. After she got us our drinks and took our order we did not get approached for almost 30 min untill the food runner brought us or food my wife had to ask him for a soda because our waitress was MIA for 30 min which again the whole time she was just hanging around her kiosk not tending to any off her tables. And it seemed to only be her every other waiter in the restaurant was very attentive to their guests greeting them withon a couple of minutes and breaking down the menu and always checking on them this was not the case for us. As for the food it was really good and that is why i would recommend it! The burger was cooked perfect my wifes margarita pizza she absolutely loved. So because of the food quality and how i seen the the rest of the wait staff working i give them a 4 star our waitress almost caused ys to walk out though.
April 26, 2015|Food overall is pretty good. Excellent service!|4|We had a reservation for brunch and were seated right away. Though, it was very hectic and noisy in there and it took some time for our waiter to acknowledge us. Once he did, everything was great - outstanding service the whole time. If it weren't for our nice window seat, we would have been in the middle of a room full of noise and screaming kids. That sort of atmosphere is definitely not my thing. I ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup. It seems it's one of the things they are known for. I was not impressed. The bread looked and tasted as though it was submerged in a bowl of melted butter. It was so buttery and wet when I picked it up. Too much butter! The tomato soup was just fair. It was room temperature and had a very bitter taste to it. I could taste nothing but the acidity of the tomatoes. There was no real flavor to it. My husband liked his meal. He ordered the omelet with the black beans and quesadillas. Overall I'd recommend it but I wouldn't get the same meal. The beer selections were good and the service was great.
April 25, 2015|Red Stripe Providence|4|We love this restaurant. Our party of 6 was very pleased with their meals. The Tuna and Strogonauf were excellent. Mussels are the best anywhere. My friend did complain that the short ribs were too salty. The noise level is a bit too high, but there's not much you can do about that. We love the lively energetic scene but I think I would stick to no more than 4 people next time. This was my 3rd visit in 5 months and plan to make it more regular.
April 25, 2015|Great Food, Wonderful Touches|5|I had the Duck Conf it and my mother had the Short Ribs. Both were wonderful, the Short Ribs especially, a generous portion with comforting mashed potatoes. When the restaurant is busy, it is a bit louder in there due to the acoustics. But the food is so great the noise wouldn't deter me from bringing a date there. It is a great value for the quality of food they prepare. I would recommend Red Stripe to a friend.
April 18, 2015|First Time|5|We went to Red Stripe w/friends, after our original plans fell through. My husband and I have never been there before, and I found them on Google map, while looking for something else. Our friends have been there before and said it was a good place. We made reservation, and the day of, we were running a bit late. The staff at Red Stripe were very accommodating, Our table was ready as we walked in the door. The food was delicious. The Paella was a big hit. Service was great, we will definitely go back.
April 17, 2015|Enjoyable|4|My husband and I took my mom out for dinner. We had a nice time. It was a little challenging for mom to hear conversation because of the noise level. Food was good...nice portions. Service was great. I would go again!
April 11, 2015|Love the salmon and potato latke!|5|Love the salmon and potato latke!
April 11, 2015|One of our favorites|5|We were planning a trip to Rhode Island last year, discovered this restaurant on Open Table, and took a chance. It is off the beaten track and in a neighborhood that you would not expect to find such a quality establishment. We had a fabulous experience. So when we returned to the area recently we went again. Still tremendous! The Beef Bourginon was tender , ribs were meaty, and muscles were tasty. Our only complaint was that the creme broule was over-cooked. Our waiter overheard us, much to our embarrassment, brought over the Manager, and naturally they were all apologetic and offered us whatever replacement we wanted. Other than that, it was another great family meal. On a side note, all the waiters last year had beards (the men, that is.) We went back in part to check on that, as one of my sons has a full one. Alas, some had shaved, however our waiter from last year still sported his.
April 4, 2015|Special entrée of flounder was very deli...|4|Special entrée of flounder was very delicious with nice crispy skin while the fish was nice and moist and plentiful. Served with tasty squash risotto and grilled asparagus made for a nice combination of flavors. Roasted 1/2 chicken also very tasty. As always, Dana's service was just right.
March 28, 2015|Red Stripe Review|4|The mussels were wonderful, may be the best I've ever had. My pork was dry but potatoes and veg good. Over all experience was very good. Our waiter was pleasant and efficient.
March 28, 2015|Always Fantastic!|5|We had Dana once again as our server. He is absolutely amazing, makes terrific suggestions & recommendations, and provides superior friendly service! He is one of the reasons we keep returning to Red Stripe!! Food is always fantastic!! I usually start with the Mussels Portuguese style...just can't get enough of them and they are the BEST mussels around!!! Hubby loves the smoked salmon plate...and the homemade bread!! I am Celiac and love the fact that there are so many options for me to enjoy that are gluten free. We adore the truffle fries...and I can have them!!! I tried the Pan Roasted Brick Chicken for the first time and it was absolutely delicious!! Hubby had the Steak Frites this time...which is another dish we enjoy. We have never had a bad meal at Red Stripe and love visiting! Looking forward to the seasonal menu change so we can try new things. We keep returning for the super service and fantastic food!!
March 27, 2015|lived up to the hype!!!!|4|Excellent food!!! Heard a lot about this place for a while and boy oh boy did it live up to the chatter. The hanger steak was perfection. Never had such a tender piece of meat like that before (twss). The fries were even good. Seasoned to perfection. I tried the fish and chips off of someone else's plate .... Excellent. As for the drinks, they definitely don't skimp on the alcohol. Sangria is recommended! It isn't a huge place but definitely didn't feel cramped in the least! Go now!!!!
March 24, 2015|Grilled pizza delicious with added onion...|4|Grilled pizza delicious with added onions and mushrooms. Cider brined pork tenderloin cooked perfectly and nicely accompanied with Brussels sprouts and sweet potato latke. Roasted beet salad nice starter but not quite sure what the greens were!
March 20, 2015|Tasty casual dining|4|Two of our party of three really liked their meals; one said it was nothing special but fine. Service was friendly and attentive. We were glad we had reservations at a Friday lunch. As a choice for a heterogenous group, this was just right. The menu has a good variety of sandwiches and entrees, apart from their inexplicable focus on mussels (moules). My only disappointment was the noise level. I hate having to shout to be understood while dining -- a problem that makes me increasingly reluctant to dine out for good conversation with friends. Admittedly all of our party is over 50.
March 15, 2015|Sunday Brunch|4|Attentive service, good food, coffee was a little cool. Noise level was high. It was hard to talk to my date sitting next to me. Otherwise very good.
March 9, 2015|Federal Hill Alternative|4|Looking for an alternative to the tourist trap on Federal Hill, where the parking is non-existant and the food often disappointing, we selected this restaurant primarily as it was open on Mondays. The greeter gave us a table away from the bar as we requested and the service was immediate. If one sizes up the cuisine by the bread, this place had us ready for a fine dining experience. the menu was eclectic and interesting. My cider infused pork tenderloin was like butter. The chive and potato lattke was crisp and the fritto misto was tender and lightly fried. This is great value for the quality. Looking forward to return.
March 6, 2015|Great Mussels, Great Burger|4|Loved the burger, very stocky and tasty. Definitely not a frozen patty. The mussels were very good and we liked how they offered around 8 different types. Good portions in general. The only thing I didn't like was that our waiter never checked on us and was not very attentive.
March 2, 2015|Great Lunch place|4|I have been to Red Stripe several times and have always enjoyed their food. I prefer lunch though because its just quieter and easier for conversation. During busy times at night, the noise level makes conversation strained.
March 1, 2015|Lunch/Brucnh Review|4|Service was a bit slow, was a busy Sunday lunch before Friars hoops game, but that should not be an excuse. Croque masseur open face sandwich was skimpy. Bloody Mary too much ice. Frites very good and burgers very solid. Vibrant atmosphere, solid bar scene.
March 1, 2015|Great - with Expectations|5|From the perfect grilled cheese and tomato soup foodie option to the classic eggs benedict, you are going to have a full range of excellent choices. Although the menu doesn't list gluten free, the servers and chefs are very attentive. Don't worry. They will guide you to great options. I had the poached eggs over bbq pulled pork hash, and it was incredible AND gluten free. If you're the martini type, the Grey Goose Pear option is perfection. And there are classic brunch options - the Bloody Marys arrived with just the right amount of celery. ( I'm not a fan of the full garden vegetable Bloody Mary presentation.....) The vibe and feel of the place encouraged lively conversation and laughter. Terrific setting for a meal with family that are friends. Wait staff were reasonably attentive - and all meals arrived hot. The kitchen staff clearly know how to time options. Beautiful plating as well. Now, here is the Expectations part: This is a very popular place for brunch. Be prepared for a lively (aka LOUD) environment. And since we went at a peak time (11:45 ish), servers are busy - attentive - but busy. There will be, hmm, pauses between orders and serving. If you're blessed with lively conversation with friends and family - well - you won't even notice.
February 28, 2015|Good for a night out just not a date|3|the food was great, but the seating and loudness of the area was a little to much for a cozy little date night. I'd recommend it for a medium size group that wants a semi-casual dinner.
February 20, 2015|Consistently good|4|The food is always good here. Nice menu, something for everyone. Our waiter was great...very attentive and friendly. Our only issue - it is VERY noisy on a busy night and hard to converse with the rest of your table unless you lean forward and raise your voice. Not kidding on this. Love that tgey groke down a wall and expanded their space into what was a women's clothing store. Looks really nice!
February 20, 2015|Loved it!!|5|Food was really, really great and the waitress was out of this world! We were with a group of 5 and not one complaint. Definitely will recommend!!!
February 19, 2015|Fun and energetic|3|My husband and I were just here to have dinner with our college son. We have been here approximately 10 times in the past few years. Red Stripe is consistent with every visit. Th vibe is fun and loud. Come if you want a fun dinner, not a serious conversation with someone. It has the look of a quintessential brasserie. The service is constantly uneven. Everybody is friendly. The hostess is always accommodating. Service starts out attentive, then the wait staff always disappears at some point. Unavailable for another glass of wine, or at the end of the meal when you might want coffee or dessert. The food is good, but has the potential to be better. Our moules frites is good, but this time the frites were not long and whole. The were pieces like the end of a potato chip bag. No waiter to be found. The short ribs and mashed potatoes were good, but it had brussels sprouts thrown in, they did not enhance the dish. It should have been a side. We will be back, but service never improves.
February 18, 2015|Great Service and excellent food.|5|Red Stripe is the type of restaurant you will keep coming back to because of the reliability of the service and quality of the food. My last visit I had the bouillabaisse which was fantastic. I highly recommend Red Stripe.
February 13, 2015|Great Valentines dinner!|4|Food well prepared! Service was good. Enjoyed our meal. Definitely would go back.
February 7, 2015|Fantastic Experience|5|My fiancée and I went to Red Stripe for an early Valentine's dinner and were totally thrilled with every aspect of our meal. We were seated promptly even though we were a little early for our reservation. Our server was super friendly and attentive. Cocktails came out quickly followed by the starters (duck confit roulades and sweet potato latkes--yum!). We split steak with truffled frites for our entrée and finished the entire plate! I can't say enough good things about Red Stripe, we will definitely dine here again. This was our second time here for dinner and we appreciate the consistently delicious food and outstanding service.
February 6, 2015|Consistently Good|5|Redateipe is an energetic fun atmosphere with great service and always good food. Reservations are recommended because the restaurant fills up fast.
February 6, 2015|Food never disappoints!  Clams and lingu...|4|Food never disappoints! Clams and linguini included abundanza clams. Fish and chips also very good sized portion. Caesar salad nicely split for 2 to share.
January 31, 2015|Ideal for a small group|5|I had dinner there recently for my birthday with some family and had a great experience. The atmosphere was lively, but not to the point where it was too loud. The food was delicious! they offer an interesting menu that reinvents some old favorites. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and present just enough. I will certainly be going back.
January 31, 2015|Overall, I liked the scene. Integrated b...|3|Overall, I liked the scene. Integrated bar/dining room made for a little louder experience. Wait staff were great. Clam chowder was a nice start. Reuben was very fatty. First bite was complete fat with no meat. Had to use my discrete skills to dispose of the bite. Chef should not have allowed that to happen. Fries and sides were nice and my companion's meals were enjoyed. Maybe I was unlucky. I will try it again.
January 28, 2015|Nice spot locally for lunch.|5|We often visit when looking for a nice lunch spot closeby. Great deal for soup and a sandwich!
January 26, 2015|Went on the way back from NYC|4|We went on a snowy night so it wasn't very crowded, but I expect it to be a vibrant place on a typical night.
January 25, 2015|Brunch|5|Brunch is always great! Steak and eggs are so delicious! Thanks!
January 24, 2015|Fun birthday celebration|5|My family decided to celebrate my daughter's birthday with brunch/lunch at Red Stripe. They were very accommodating it was snowing and I called to day we would be delayed a bit, they gave us parking advice. The food was very good, two of us had the mussels which were delicious. Even though I hadn't mentioned the birthday when I booked our reservation, the waitress overheard our conversation and brought my daughter's dessert with a lit candle. Very thoughtful. We would definitely return.
January 23, 2015|4th visit for diner|4|Love the variety of mussels and frites, Good appetizers and my wife loves the cheese sandwich
January 20, 2015|Meeting with friends|4|I had never been to the Red Stripe and went there to meet with a couple of friends I hadn't seen in awhile. It was easy to get to and had parking. Went early but by the time I left the place had a very good crowd for a Tuesday night. The food was excellent and the service very good. We had appetizers and a drink first and then a meal and everything was hot and delicious. We weren't rush at all and it made for a very relaxing and enjoyable evening. I will definitely go again.
Dined on January 15, 2015|Lousy service|2|Unfortunately my experience was not favorable. This is my neighborhood go to place but no more. The service was poor, our server approached up early on and then ignored us. It was busy and I feel he was overwhelmed. He tried to make it up to us once the restaurant thinned out but alas too late to kiss up! The food was lousy...the only good thing about red stripe lately is the bread!
January 13, 2015|Great spot for lunch or dinner.|4|Came here with my girlfriend on a Tues night and was seated right away. From the outside, the street was quiet but inside, the restaurant was bustling. Waiter was very attentive. Grilled cheese - Made with prosciutto, pear and pesto. The blend of flavors definitely was refreshing and reminded me of the Thanksgiving holiday. The bread was perfectly crisp due to high amounts of brushed butter. Clam chowder - Not canned! It was filled with clams, corn, peas. Not too thick but not watery either. Solid soup. Clams - Huge pieces and decent sauce. I got the saffron sauce and it was just average for me. Not too flavorful. I'd try some other sauce next time. Truffled fries - Tasty but a bit salty. Overall, I had a great time, good food at a reasonable price. I'd come back again to try other menu items for sure.
January 11, 2015|Could not have been better!|5|Outstanding menu. It was hard to decide what to order. Food was cooked perfectly. Interesting and nicely presented. Can't wait to go back.
January 10, 2015|Atmosphere|5|The food at Red Stripe never disappoints. Paired with it's atmosphere it's a perfect match. Salute
January 7, 2015|Mussels rule!|4|I found this place last year with friends and just love it. The food is great w little special treats like hot bread delivered just when you r nearing the end of your mussels and need something to sop up the cream! Service is great. It can get a little loud but that is part of the charm. I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting menu! Bon appetite
January 3, 2015|Excellent!|5|Excellent food, excellent service, excellent overall experience! The scallops with sweet potato risotto were delicious!
January 3, 2015|Consistently Good, Neighborhood Bistro|4|Consistent food, french bistro vibe. Mostly have cme for brunch/lunch and have never been disappointed. Tomato soup is a winner. Frites are fantastic - thin sliced and crisp!
December 31, 2014|Spot on|5|When we sforat arrived they wanted to seat is near the kitchen entrance which I was disappointed because we reserved with Open Table. Luckily they were able to move us to the new room. The atmosphere, service, drinks and food were all exceptional! We had a great time.
December 31, 2014|Disappointing|3|We have been to this restaurant a number of times and had very positive experiences, which made our recent visit particularly disappointing. The chicken I ordered was greasy and tasted as though someone had burned something in the pan and cotninued to use it for cooking, the sauce was gloppy, and the bread seemed a bit stale. Perhaps they were having an off night, but it will be some time before we give it another try.
December 28, 2014|Overall very good on all counts, except service|4|"This restaurant is on my ""short list"" whenever I am taking someone out in Providence. Food was excellent as always: good range of options, French bistro influence, nicely prepared. Atmosphere was lively, as usual, which makes it fun. The problem tonight was that we waited for really an unacceptable period of time between appys and dinner course; the waiter was quite apologetic about the kitchen running behind, but even correcting for that, the wait was too long. (A party of 4 next to us arrived as we were eating our appys, but received their dinners well before us)"
December 26, 2014|Great staple restaurant|5|It's a place you can go all the time. Menu has plenty of options from grilled cheese to mussels. I've been twice and everything I've ordered has been awesome. Highly recommend
December 22, 2014|Consistently inconsistent|4|Food is usually better than average, but not on a consistent basis. The kitchen makes food - which is a few steps below preparing dinner for their customers. For example, it would be hard to miss plating a chared/ burned sweet potato side dish, yet the cook plated it and the food expediter brought it to the table (expediter might have been the manager). Top side of vegetable was mostly chared and entire bottom was black. Good wait staff/service made up for the meal that appeared to be lacking care in the meal preparation arena.
December 20, 2014|charming and lively neighborhood bistro|5|what a find! booked this for a dinner rendezvous with friends in Providence and it was terrific. lively, authentic bistro food, updated - the steak frites was terrific; a veggie with us had the appetizer plate of hummus, baba, etc, and loved it; a roast chicken dish was sumptuous, well-seasoned and nicely presented. great wines by the glass, efficient service, cute atmosphere. Desserts going past looked good, but we were full. A half-dozen single diners having dinner at the bar is always a good sign - locals, I presume. We will return.
December 20, 2014|Very Solid!|4|Always consistent. Good food at a good price point. It's not fine dining but that's what's good about it. Steak frites were very good, calamari appetizer is excellent, onion soup very good, etc. If you want a very good meal in a nice setting without breaking the bank, Red Stripe is an excellent choice. Highly recommend...
December 20, 2014|A Winner|5|Brought relatives from out of town. Raves all around for food, atmosphere, service, price.
December 19, 2014|Red Stripe always delivers!|5|Our fantastic experience here recently was enhance by super-waitron Stephanie (the St. Germain-grapefruit juice special cocktails she suggested did not hurt, either). Bravo!
December 12, 2014|Always a good spot|4|Red Stripe is always a good spot for either lunch or dinner. I have my favorite items and to be honest, I rarely vary my order. As a result, it is easy to notice the consistency within the kitchen. My entree never changes in flavor or size. I get the Salad Nicoise with a piece of grilled salmon on top. The servers are very pleasant without hovering and being intrusive. I go to dinner with my husband so we can talk to each other and have a pleasant evening. I like to share brief pleasantries with the staff but am not interested in having someone at my elbow the entire time or worse, interrupting our conversation multiple times during our meal. The restaurant can get loud but we have not really minded that because with all the buzz and tables a bit close to each other, you can still have a private conversation. We really enjoy it.
December 5, 2014|Clams and linguini loaded with clams, al...|4|Clams and linguini loaded with clams, also nicely garlicky. Pork tenderloin so tender did not really need steak knife provided! Brussel sprouts and sweet potato latke delicious accompaniments to pork. Food never disappoints here!
November 23, 2014|good for brunch|4|The restaurant has delicious food, it is fresh, and the flavor tastes good.
November 21, 2014|Consistently good!|5|The food was great as well as the service. We had been concerned that after the expansion, service might suffer, but we were not disappointed. Sean was excellent! The one thing you do need to prepare for is the noise level. We find ourselves speaking louder to have a conversation due to the energetic atmosphere.
November 21, 2014|Great casual bistro|4|Outstanding neighborhood restaurant with great food and fun vibe.
November 15, 2014|Fantastic mussels!|5|My party and I greatly enjoyed our time spent at Red Stripe. The atmosphere was laid back, the service was on point, and the food was fantastic. The variety of mussels was great, and we all really enjoyed the options. French fries are also everything I had heard they would be, and the pate and roulades appetizers were amazing. Chowder was good as well - the bacon and corn really added some great texture and flavor to a New England standard. Great wine list that offers bottles that aren't too expensive - right up a 20-somethings alley! We will definitely be back and am looking forward to trying other options on their menu
November 12, 2014| Our server, Don, was EXCELLENT!!!  Very...|5|Our server, Don, was EXCELLENT!!! Very attentive, catered to our Mom's allergies and was very engaging. Food was on point as always.
November 8, 2014|Highly recommended|5|Everything about evening was wonderful, we had great service, the food was delicious, and a nice selection. The atmosphere was pleasant and not too formal, but special enough for our birthday celebration.
November 7, 2014|Good dinner|4|took family for dinner - food is great, service was quite slow. they were busy (friday night) but food for our table took far too long. We will go back if in the area, but may try another night that is not quite as busy.
November 7, 2014|Linguini and clams chock full of clams a...|4|Linguini and clams chock full of clams and delicious as always. Nice piece of fish in the fish & chips dish although the cole slaw was a bit too vinegary for my taste.
October 29, 2014|Bistro Fare on the East Side|4|Great place for traditional and some modern twists on French Bistro Fare.........Steak Frites, Mussels, Crouque Monseir, etc......decent wine list. A local favorite on Providence's East Side.
October 26, 2014|Great brunch|5|We were on the early side for brunch and thankfully had a reservation. By the time we departed the place was hopping and reservations were a must. Food was great, portions are very generous. My only gripe was the coffee. Cups too small and it was very weak. I suggest you get a Bloody Mary instead.
October 22, 2014|An excellent and reliable choice.|5|Red Stripe is a great neighborhood bistro. The food is consistently good and the service always attentive. Dinner time is noisy, but lunch is a dream. I recommend it enthusiastically.
October 17, 2014|Everything was perfect!|5|My husband found this gem when we were looking for somewhere new to go one night. We've been back multiple times since. Everything we gotten each time was delicious. Our servers were awesome. We'll be back.
October 17, 2014|Delish|5|Second visit to Red Stripe (and yes they have Red Stripe available) and it’s quickly becoming a favorite. My husband described the Beef Stroganoff as “The best he’s ever had” and I once again loved the mussels and frites. Service was a bit slow (explained as a mistake putting in our order but). Parking can be difficult – perhaps time to add valet. Very loud so don’t bring Grandma or Grandpa if they can’t hear well. No matter we will return it's great food.
October 17, 2014|First time at Red Stripe for lunch...and...|5|First time at Red Stripe for lunch...and it did not disappoint. We usually come for dinner. Meat & Potatoes and Steak Frites were both amazing!! Great weather even at this time of year for indoor/outdoor dining! Service was very good!
October 13, 2014|a good choice|4|Red Stripe has very good, dependable food. Menu choices tend to be familiar dishes you could make at home, but they are very well made and much more fun to eat at Red Stripe. This is not the place if you are looking for cutting edge, nouvelle cuisine.
October 12, 2014|Food is always good.|4|The waiter was great. Our food was prepared according to dietary restrictions of people in our party. The hot bread is a meal in itself. I have always been satisfied. Everyone in my group was pleased.
October 11, 2014|Great spot|5|Went for moms birthday dinner. Service is great and food was fancy but not too expensive.
October 11, 2014|Food was inventive and delicious.  The b...|4|Food was inventive and delicious. The broad menu (full meals, sandwiches, hearty appetizers, etc.) was good for my varied group. Staff did excellent job of serving our group of 8. Liked the more quiet back room. Front room is much too noisy. Parking hard or expensive, unless you are lucky enough to get on-street parking.

October 5, 2014|Red Stripe for Family Dinner|4|The food is always good no matter what I select at Red Stripe. The wine list is diverse and the fresh bread on the table is lovely. Mussels are excellent if you like them definitely a good option at this restaurant. Salad is so fresh too, wish I knew the recipe to house vinaigrette! French onion soup is also very good, but large portion is huge - can be a meal in itself. The only downside can get a bit noisy but otherwise lovely cozy atmosphere, good neighborhood place. Will continue to return there. Service also always good.
October 4, 2014|Just Great!|5|Friends from Massachusetts had wanted to try red stripe, one of our favorite restaurants. They left raving about the food and service. The place is always packed, the food is always delicious, and the service is always great! Hands down...one of the best places to eat in RI!!
October 4, 2014|Normally a Great Place|3|I have had the pleasure of eating at Red Stripe a number of times over the past 8 years. It is truly a favorite. This visit, however, my fish was overcooked, fries were cool and not fresh, service was ok but not terrific, and sound level was louder than ever. I will go back based on my previous experiences and hope for a better meal. This is typically a place not to miss.
Dined on September 29, 2014|Ok for a Monday|3|Decent restaurant with decent food, but not a WOW place. Their saving grace is being open Mondays
September 28, 2014|Red Stripe delivers|4|Red Stripe is good at what it does: provide a lot of options for tasty meals. It isn't high end, but it's a step up from burgers and salads. The specialty, mussels, are always well cooked. The wait staff often seems rushed, but I'm usually there with a group and don't mind the extra time to socialize. Getting a reservation through Open Table is easy and circumvents the typical long wait.
September 28, 2014|pleasant weekend brunch|4|A nice local place. Brunch was really good, not dynamite but good. Definitely fresh. Very nice neighborhood. Wait staff efficient. Only drawback...tables way too close. Seemed like a locale for families visiting their college kids.
September 19, 2014|Extremely Slow Service|1|It us 1.5 hrs to get our meal served! My husband got an onion soup that came 30 min after ordering. But I sat at the table almost 2h before getting a tomato soup & grilled cheese sandwich! We complained to the waiter after 1hr & he told us that my husbands chicken takes 30 min to cook. We asked for the manager who told us the food would be out in a minute. And that she would comp us 2 desserts. We ended up packing up my soup and the desserts. It was an annoying dining experience.
September 18, 2014|dependably good|4|Red Stripe is a dependably good neighborhood restaurant.
September 17, 2014|Consistently good!|4|Have visted Red Stripe many times and it's always been great!
September 15, 2014|Special Occasion|5|We celebrated my girlfriends 50th birthday lunch here and it was perfect!! The waiter, Matt was beyond great. He was attentive and very helpful in collaborating with me about the dessert. My friend has a gluten allergy so it can be tricky. Not here- there were many choices. The chocolate molten flourless cake was incredible! Bravo :)
September 14, 2014|Delish!|5|Service was great, our waitress was awesome, she knew the menu and answered all of our questions. Food was great, cooked fresh. I would definitely go back.
September 12, 2014|Would return|4|The food was good, hangar steak a bit tough as it tends to be, Meditteranean (sp) wrap very good. French fries yummmo. We went at 6:30 pm, dinnertime, families were dining but due to the small size and the bar very close by it sounded like a late Friday or Saturday night. If you don't mind lots of noise it is a great place to go. It is listed as casual elegant, whatever that is, but in practice it is casual. Would return
September 6, 2014|Totally enjoyed everything-food A+!|5|This was a fabulous find for us (*suggested by folks we met in a park) - and the food, service, and overall experience were over the top! Can't wait to return to this spot for sampling more of the wonderful looking menu items we observed being served up all around us!
September 6, 2014|Delicious|4|We went to this restaurant for our 2nd wedding anniversary- It is not the most romantic place but the food is AMAZING! A must have is the grilled cheese with tomato soup- it has pear and prosciutto in it- soooo delicious!
September 6, 2014|Consistently fabulous|5|What more can be said? Our most favorite place with or without babies. Our home away from home.
September 5, 2014|We are frequent diners. Kitchen serves u...|4|We are frequent diners. Kitchen serves until 11:00 which is late by local standards. Food is consistently good, wine choice good. Our waiter, Dana, always ensures we get a window seat and takes good care of us. RS is always loud and energenitic when we arrive after 9:00 but by the time we leave it's quiet. Oddly enough, it appears to have a vibrant, young bar scene, late 20s-30s, but not a late one. We often go after theatre, concert etc. It's sometimes obvious Visiting Brown parents take their students here too. Pizza, sandwiches to full meals. Great spot.
September 5, 2014|Nice touch that the waiter remembered us...|4|Nice touch that the waiter remembered us from a previous visit! Also nice that the Caesar salad was split for two to share. Nice choice of toppings available for the flatbread.
August 30, 2014|Friendly, enthusiastic service!|4|We arrived a bit early, but they hostess was able to seat us right away. She was very accommodating to our 5 month old, and our (extra) large stroller. Our server was very friendly and enthusiastically described the menu items. He offered a taste when I wasn't sure about the rose special (delicious and reasonably priced; we ordered a bottle). We started with chicken liver pate, which was smooth and creamy, and served with house made pickled veggies. My husband enjoyed a pot of very large mussels. The Red Stripe sauce was perfect for sopping up with bread. I had the duck confit two ways. I was very happy with the rich duck leg, but the mushroom risotto was under seasoned and disappointing. Overall, a great experience!
August 25, 2014|Consistently good food/wine options|4|Always busy, sometimes noisy. Menu is creative and the food is fresh; wine list diverse. You won't find a better grilled cheese sandwich in Rhode Island, and their fries are crispy and abundant. Waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly. Bar is always busy. They have just expanded seating capacity, which will reduce the wait for a table. If you are around Wayland Square in Providence, be sure to stop in and enjoy delicious menu selections.
August 24, 2014|Love it here|5|An all time favorite. The bread is amazing! We are regulars and will keep coming back.
August 23, 2014|special night|4|We celebrated our wedding anniversary here on Saturday. Could not have been a better choice in Providence Away from the hill and all of it's parking mess! Everything about the dinner was spot on..
August 21, 2014|Consistently good|5|I've eaten here a bunch of times, and it consistently good. I especially like the corned beef at brunch, which is made with beets and short ribs. Service is always top notch.
August 13, 2014|Fabulous!|5|Our waiter Arron was fabulous...attentive, entertaining...took our pic np. Duck leg was fabulous! Hanger steak undercooked but tasty, salmon was fresh. Wine list offered great range of wines. Trolley Pinot Grigio was nice!. Super Tuscan was perfect finish with the steak. Lava cake...and coffee ice cream was nothing special, but we ate every drop. Will definitely go back! Order the duck entree! Definitely recommend red stripe!!!
August 10, 2014|Consistently fantastic.|5|What more can I say? Whenever we need a guaranteed great night out, with or without kids, Red Stripe is our first choice.
August 9, 2014|Its a scream|3|Literally. You need to scream to be heard in this very busy, energetic, loud room. The room is pretty and comfortable. We were fortunate enough to have a terrific waiter who was just attentive enough without being pushy or annoying. The food was okay. It was good but nothing that knocked anyone's socks off. But it was so loud in this restaurant that having a conversation at the table was difficult without yhaving to yell.
August 8, 2014|Great neighborhood restaurant|4|Wonderful food however a bit loud even in the back room. Next time we request a seat out front on the sidewalk. What a cool place. My fiance recommends the restaurant as well.
August 8, 2014|Great food|5|"My daughter and I both had the steak frites, mine ""on the rare side of medium rare"", hers rare. Both came out perfectly. I had asked for both the red wine butter and the blue cheese butter since I wanted to try both onyhe steak. Both were great. Loved the meal."
August 8, 2014|Amazing in every way.|5|Amazing food, great ambiance, great service, a place you just have to check out. Cannot wait to go there again.
August 7, 2014|New Favorite!|5|My husband and I love Red Stripe! It is our new favorite Providence area restaurant. The food is delicious, the chicken liver pate, steak and frites, moules (mussels), paella are all exquisite, and the homemade chocolate chip cookie dessert, YUUMMM! The food is matched by exemplary service. The wait staff is knowledgable, friendly and efficient, consistently spot on. Red Stripe has a great bistro vibe and the decor to match. We love REd Stripe!!!
August 4, 2014|Red Stripe Restaurant|4|My reservation was honored as booked. The food was very good and served properly. My only complaint was that I had left a message when making my Open Table reservation that my daughter would be celebrating her birthday on our visit to the Red Stripe, but that fact was never acknowledged in any fashion by either the waiter or the restaurant management. I never reported this to the manager, but I am reporting it now as I was disappointed in the oversight.
July 31, 2014|Good Food, Good Atmosphere|3|A safe bet for a nice meal at reasonable price; friendly neighborhood vibe. Well-spaced tables in handsome dining room with bar facing open kitchen. Watch out for small portions--our sea scallop main had three (!) scallops a lot of greens, and some risotto. Good, but was expecting something more substantial. Steak frites entree was a winner.
July 24, 2014|Great food|5|Love the Paella! I've only been twice so I am just exploring the many options on the menu
July 18, 2014|Fun, Fabulous|5|Our second visit to Red Stripe. This time we brought 3 friends: two from MetroWest Boston and one from New Orleans. We all agreed that Red Stripe is fantastic! The wait staff are knowledgeable and pleasant - highly rated by all of us. The food is outstanding and prepared perfectly. A wide variety of dishes, deserts, drinks, and wine. We just love Red Stripe. Providence has seafood and Italian food covered. Red Stripe is a welcome opportunity to experience another world of cuisine.
July 14, 2014|July 14, 2014|5|After picking Red Stripe off Google search, we arrived to what is a local, neighborhood place; a very nice find. The staff was very pleasant, accommodating and helpful. The food was delicious with the steak cutting like butter and the quantity ample. The French onion soup had a unique taste, not like others I've had which is soup with onions; I liked it very much. The patrons all seem to be enjoying their time and food; in my opinion it’s a place for couples to dine and carry-on a conversation; whoops there is a downside – everyone is talking so things can get a little loud. Great place, go experience it yourself – you won’t be disappointed!
July 14, 2014|nice and predictable.  quality food.  fr...|4|nice and predictable. quality food. friendly and capable service
July 12, 2014|Great food and even better service|5|Great food. Especially if you like mussels. Wonderful service. Service personnel suggested we might not like a house wine we selected and brought us a taste. Wine was interesting but he was correct, not what we were looking for. We drove from Worcester MA to dine here for the third time, and will do so again.
July 12, 2014|Good eats in Wayland Square|4|We were visiting Brown, but wanted to relax after the end of the day somewhere not right on top of the campus. Red Stripe was about a mile away from Brown, but close to our hotel, so we gave it a go, despite reading complaints about it being greasy and overpriced on Yelp. Not our experience, although we stuck to the basics: Very good onion soup, burgers, hanger steak sandwiches, meat loaf (although, as some posters noted, you couldn't taste the bacon that was supposed to be inside). Saw lots of raves about the mussels, but I'm allergic, and no one else was interested. The restaurant was crowded and energetic, with a good mix of people - not just college kids. Service was friendly, but on the slow side. We would definitely go back.
July 12, 2014|Great food|5|Took my wife out for her birthday with her family. Our table was quiet once the food came because we all enjoyed our meal so much.
July 6, 2014|Off nite|2|We really weren't satisfied at all. My salmon came out undercooked and I got my dinner back when my husband was done. The lentils in the dish were also over cooked. My husband had an open steak sandwich and in had at least a half a cup of sautéed red onions on it which he had to remove to eat it. We go frequently, but this was an off night!
July 5, 2014|Good food, good times|4|The food is consistently good and moderately priced. Fun and a little loud great atmosphere for a group.
July 4, 2014|Great spot|4|Trendy, full of families as well as college students. (Near Brown). Food was very good. Seafood mainly.
July 4, 2014|Always a solid experience|5|We are locals and are big fans of Red Stripe. We usually sit at the bar and think tops of Wendy who often serves us (both in terms of skill and person). Food choices cover a good range and is always well-prepared. The night this reservation is related to we had great service. Unfortunately can't remember his name, but our waiter (had a beard) was great at being attentive to a rather sizable group.
July 3, 2014|2nd visit to Red Stripe  & had another a...|5|2nd visit to Red Stripe & had another amazing night! Food was fantastic, delicious, offer many gluten free items as well. Dana was our server again & he was absolutely amazing!! Super friendly, knowledgeable, attentive & made great suggestions/recommendations! Gluten Free Key Lime Cheesecake is THE BEST GLUTEN FREE DESSERT ANYWHERE!! It is absolutely heavenly & decadently delicious! Our new favorite restaurant!! Will definitely request Dana again...great service makes a good meal even better!!
Dined on July 3, 2014|Terrific experience!|5|"Had been here for lunch a few times, this was first time for dinner. Due to past experience, expected a great meal with good service and Red Stripe definitely delivered on that! Husband and I brought a friend along. Surprised at how busy the restaurant was on Thursday night with it being ""summer in the city!"". Good thing we had made a reservation. Seated immediately, vibrant, energetic scene, superb very friendly waiter, and we all were delighted with our meals. Shared the rice ball appetizer which was huge and plenty for 3 of us to split, husband loved his pork dish, friend her pasta selection, and my stroganoff was a real treat. Highly recommend for any occasion!"
July 3, 2014|Good food|5|Red Stripe is located in my neighborhood and it is a great spot for dinner. The dishes are good (not excellent). I always order the mussels + frites. Great value. Will continue to return.
June 29, 2014|Decent Neighborhood Establishment|3|"During a visit to Providence, Red Stripe was recommended by several sources. We emerged underwhelmed. Individual items are well prepared, but dinner combinations can be misguided. My duck confit was very well prepared, as was the accompanying mushroom risotto. But the two dishes did not belong together, and there was certainly no reason for the restaurant to put the arugula ""salad"" directly on top of the risotto. Moreover, the dish seemed better suited to December than June. The restaurant was noisy, our seats were cramped, and we were not provided the bread service other patrons received."
June 28, 2014|Inconsistent|3|Service is always very good but the food is inconsistent. Some visits the food is great and other visits its mediocre at best. Too many great resturants in the city to settle for just average.
June 22, 2014|Always a pleasurable experience|5|Great food, great service and perfect for brunch. I have been to Red Stripe many times and if have never been disappointed.
June 15, 2014|Go to|4|This is my neighborhood go to place... Always good food, an easy walk to and from... Easy to bring guests as they can find something on the menu to please any palette
June 11, 2014|Economy is killing staffing|3|One of our favorite restaurants, but it was a miss this time. Not enough staff on, had to wait long time for drinks and food to arrive. We had to ask several times for silverware & water. The waiter tried his best (Dan) but really had too many tables to cover. The other wait staff couldn't cover because they were just as busy. Was this because the restaurant was trying to cut costs? or was it because there just wasn't enough wait staff available to staff the shift? Very disappointed with the manager who we watched walk around, but never went to any tables...very ineffectual.
June 7, 2014|Good fun and fun atmosphere!|5|We just spent a great night at Red Stripe! The food was delicious and all in our party (age 9-70) enjoyed their meals and the atmosphere. We are looking forward to your opening in the East Greenwich location!
June 7, 2014|Delicious as usual|5|This was my second time dining here. It was fabulous again. The food is delicious! Portions are generous. I had the steak frites with the red wine butter, it was cooked perfectly. We took our friends here for their anniversary and they were impressed and can't wait to go back! Interestingly, the couple we took here last time showed up with their friends! They too loved it and were eager to return!
May 31, 2014|great food|5|we have gone to red stripe for brunch a few times, and it was always a solid choice. we recently had lunch there, though, and it was really excellent. there were 6 of us (including a 1 year old), and everyone enjoyed their food. i personally thought the pastrami sandwich was quite delicious. we will be back again!
May 30, 2014|Great first time experience|5|Everything about this restaurant was excellent, the food, the service, the bread, atmosphere, timing, great affordable wine selection, choice micro brews on tap. I had the paella, my wife had the pork tenderloin special, both were presented with pride and were delicious. We shared an equally unforgetable dessert. The dishes that we ordered were alittle pricey so I would only use this restaurant experience for special occasions. But there are other offerings that are more within our price range so we will be back sooner to try more selections that also look great.
May 29, 2014|My go to place|4|When ever I want to go out, Red Stripe is the place that always comes to mind first. They have really good food, an energetic atmosphere and the are located in Wayland Square- a fun area of Providence.
May 17, 2014|The mussels and the bread are incredible...|4|The mussels and the bread are incredible and most of the wait staff are very pleasant. My husband and I did take our two children here once, however, and the waitress we had that night was very unpleasant towards my kids even though they were behaving very well.
May 17, 2014|dinner|5|We had a wonderful dinner at Red Stripe. We sat in the window with windows open. Our waiter was kind, friendly, great personality, and knowledgeable. Everyone in our group enjoyed their dinners, server, and the restaurant. It was a beautiful evening.
May 17, 2014|Will be back!|5|"This was my first visit to the Red Stripe, and my friend and I were very impressed. In the first place, they honored our request for a table to one side so we could ""catch up"" after not seeing each other for months. In the second place, our waitress was pleasant, prompt, and very capable ... and we never felt rushed. And in the third place, the grilled cheese sandwiches we each had were out of this world! Served with a good sized bowl of delicious oven roasted tomato soup, the meal was more than we could even finish!! I am looking forward to returning to this great restaurant!"
May 14, 2014|Consistently great...|5|We go to Red Stripe often, all of their dinners and appetizers are great. I am a finicky eater and they always have something great for my basic needs and something for my wife's eclectic taste. I also consider service as important as any another aspect of dining and their service is always great from reservations to paying the bill.
May 11, 2014|Late Brunch|4|I had a reservation for 3:00 PM on Mother's Day, which I thought would be a good time where you may get brunch and late lunch simultaneously. I was wrong, they had a very late ending brunch this past Sunday, or so we were told. Anyway, brunch was good, you have options for a variety of omelettes, eggs bennes, burgers, salads and sandwiches. I had the Salad Nicoise with Grilled Salmon and she had the Caesar Salad that came with Grilled Chicken and poached eggs. Both were tasty and plentiful - a real nice mid-afternoon meal when topped with a tall frosty. Surprisingly only 3 draft choices - I would have thought 5 or 6 would be there - maybe they don't get a big calling for more. The windows were open, it's warm, sunny, no traffic - nice!
May 11, 2014|Awesome as always!|5|The Red Stripe moule and frites are my favorite!! One of the main reasons that I go to Red Stripe, plus the excellent Bloody Mary! I have been here numerous times and is always excellent food and great service, whether it is brunch, lunch, or dinner!
May 10, 2014|Red Stripe|4|Great Saturday night spot. Good location and plenty of parking Food was very enjoyable. Loved the fries!
May 10, 2014|We will return!|5|The food was fabulous. A Hummus, Tabbouleh, & Babganoush starter with Poulette Moules (half order with a house salad), Mouclade Moules (full order split between two with a house salad and french onion soup), and Fish & Chips for 4 adults. A few more pitas with the starter would have been good but that’s always the case. It’s loud, so if you’re bringing grandma she won’t hear a thing. And they had Red Stripe available in a bottle.
May 10, 2014|OK FOOD, GOOD SERVICE.|2|When we got seated, our waiter Sean was outstanding. He was knowledgeable, pleasant and patient. The best service I've had at Red Stripe. The food was hit or miss. -The calamari app was very good, crispy, tender and yummy. The dip sauce was spicy and delicious. -The pizza was good but not crispy enough. The crust did not hold up when picked up...cheese very runny. -The hummus plate was delicious. I - had the chopped salad and I was disappointed. I left half of it. -My BF got the ziti pasta and it was so salty, we could not eat it. Even the pieces of pasta that had no sauce were super salty. We took it home and we are going to Re-Make.
May 9, 2014|Great service and food|4|Food was very good. We had an outstanding and personable waiter
May 3, 2014|Great dinner|5|We had an excellent dinner here. The only problem was that we had a reservation but had to wait 25 minutes to get a table. I asked about our tables status once and they said they were just waiting for people to leave. Once we were seated the manager came over and did not charge us for corkage for the wine we brought in. We were very pleased that they offered that without us complaining. For a starter we shared the Basque Calamari which was great. For dinner we had the Steak Frites, excellent and prepared as requested; Seared Sea Scallops, very tender and wonderful; Fish and Chips, very good. No room for dessert. Great meal and we would return.
May 3, 2014|High quality food, reasonable price|5|Red Stripe is a go-to place for me whenever friends or family are in town. The food is always great and everyone can find something they'll love without a problem, yet the prices are fair and don't scare away the casual diner. Go for the pork chop, its incredible.
May 3, 2014|Our New Favorite Restaurant|5|We found Red Stripe based on a web search. Reservations were easy and within 15 minutes of our desired time (to allow us to get to a show after dinner). We LOVED Red Stripe. The menu has a wide range of choices. Great apps, drinks. Our server Aaron was was excellent - that perfect combination of friendly, efficient, knowledgeable. This is our new favorite place in Providence. Great neighborhood vibe and easy to find.
May 3, 2014|First visit|3|My wife and I were interested to check out Red Stripe. Overall the variety on the menu was good but the food left us disappointed. This place needs to cut back on the salt. The paella had great potential but the salt level was too high and one of my muscles had sand in it. My wife was excited for the duck confit pot pie but it was also too salty. The biggest let down was the French onion soup which should be a standard at this type of establishment but missed the mark, too sweet. The beat salad was great though and the high point of my meal. Atmosphere was lively and service was great.
April 27, 2014|Nice place|3|Excellent food and service. Can be noisy, so be prepared for that.
April 26, 2014|Nice east side restaurant |5|Wow! They had an extensive menu of homemade food and all four of us thought the food was great. I had the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly with good seasoning. A little loud but it was an afterthought to the food. Would def go again!
April 25, 2014|Always fun, getting better!|4|I was there the week before they closed for the expansion, which they really need since it is cramped around the bar in the evening. Place is always a popular spot - food is very good, very energetic environment (sometimes a little loud) and outstanding service. Dana, our waiter, was awesome and he took very good care of us (he, like a lot of wait staff, have been there for years). Thought the food, drinks and atmosphere were great. Only possible complaint could be the noise level (it gets loud), but this will improve once the expansion takes place. Definitely a neighborhood gem, worth putting on your list of places to go in Providence and on the East Side.
April 25, 2014|eclectic menu|5|The best little spot for interesting twists on old favorites. On our next visit we will focus on a sampling of other wonderful mussel dishe. We would lov to see a sampler mussel dish so we can try them all. Butternut risotto was creamy, tasty and well seasoned. We loved it all.
April 22, 2014|50-50|4|"My salad with everything but kitchen sink was great and the added tuna spectacular and cooked as I requested my friends sandwich could've been served on ""more interesting"" bread - he said it was just OK Hostess and our server were excellent!"
April 21, 2014|Lovely Lunch|4|"In what used to be the Newport Creamery at ""The Square"", Wayland Square on the East Side of Providence, there is now a wonderful restaurant called Red Stripe. My family and I, joined by a couple of cousins, decided to have lunch here because it was convenient to Swan Point Cemetery. The staff went out of their way to make our meal enjoyable and made certain that we were out on time! I had the Chicken Pesto Salad, which was absolutely delicious. Other members of our party were also extremely happy with their meals; all pronouncing their food delicious. The only problem we had was the noise level; it was difficult to have a conversation. Nevertheless, it was and enjoyable and delicious meal with a wonderful staff!"
April 20, 2014|Wonderful place and quality dishes|5|Red Stripe may be one of the best restaurants in Providence. The ambience is comfortable and chic. It's an upscale place without stuffy pretentions. Instead, it's welcoming -- provided you can actually get a table. Reservations are not required, but I recommend making them. The menu is an incredible selection of continental preparations of steak, fish, and chicken. The risotto croquettes were close to arancini without ragu, so I'm not sure why they were named as they were. But they were tasty and each of the two balls was a hearty size. The bouillabaisse was a New England take on the dish, with six mussels, a couple shrimp, two clams, chunks of salmon, onion, and carrots. It was great, and I took half home to have the next day.
April 20, 2014|Always Great|5|This was our second time day and have never been disappointed. Great food and service.
April 19, 2014|Will be back|4|Red Stripe is a great local joint with an open kitchen and a bustling atmosphere. The service was great and our waiter (David) made great entree and wine suggestions. The house salmon was a good choice but the potato/chive latke was more like a knish -- too thick for the salmon pairing and no chives to be seen. Still the sautéed rabe was perfect and dinner was very enjoyable. Will return.
April 19, 2014|Great time and food!|5|Took my family to celebrate an early Easter dinner. Everyone had great food. Everyone's plate was empty at the end of the night. The mussels were delicious, and the steak frites were cooked perfectly.
April 16, 2014|Wonderful find for out-of-towners|5|The reviews really helped us decide to dine here on our way from NY to Boston. Parking was a slight challenge as there is only street parking. We were seated right away and our waiter couldn't have been more personable. The food was nicely prepared and well-presented. My duck was not as tender as I would have liked, but it was still delicious. My husband loved his mussels and pommes frites, and my son enjoyed the bacon and cheese meatloaf. Desserts were yummy.
April 15, 2014|A lovely night out with friends|4|Red Stripe is a very homey, lovely neighborhood bistro. Food, ambience and service were very fine. Also, there is very strong, reasonably-priced wine list. We will come back. We loved our evening here.
April 15, 2014|Love this place!|5|Enjoyed a wonderful lunch with a good friend who had not previously been to Red Stripe. As always, a superb experience! I had the Red Stripe grilled cheese and tomato soup...every bit as tasty as touted. She had the Chop Salad and deemed it the best ever:-) This friend used to be employed in a position where she frequented many restaurants in RI, CT, and MA, and said Red Stripe is so terrific in every respect that she will recommend to everyone she knows.
April 13, 2014|fun spot|5|Red stripe was a nice find. Would recommend and will definitely go back.
Dined on April 12, 2014|AMAZING FOOD!|4|The food was truly outstanding. We had a party of 10 people and every person said that the food was fantastic. Great job on menu selection and preparation!
April 10, 2014|dinner for two this week|4|Pressed chicken and beef steak exceptionally tasty. Beet salad that we shared beforehand was disappointing and we were surprised--too much cheese and dressing, too little beet. On the other hand, we were appreciated that the kitchen split the order for us and served it on two plates. Bread was warm and, like the butter, delicious. Good selection of beer and wine. Will definitely go again.
April 6, 2014|Hadn't been to Red Stripe|5|Hadn't been to Red Stripe in a while but last week went for a late evening meal and brunch. Fantastic--wondered why I stayed away so long. Service was great on both occasions. Had chicken under the brick and my friend has the grilled scallops and both dishes were flavorful and well presented. Our waiter suggested some great glasses of wine which complimented our dinners. Went back on Sunday for brunch with another couple and everyone enjoyed their selections. In addition to my husband's breakfast choice of bread pudding french toast, which was delicious, he also had a bowl of oatmeal prepared in cider vinegar--we all tried--spectacular. Our waitress was attentive and patient, filled our coffee cups often. Will return for brunch and dinner.
April 5, 2014|Appearances are deceiving|5|What looks like a regular fun and well-loved neighborhood place is really much, much more. The menu is sophisticated without being stuffy, the specials were innovative without being trendy. Our waiter was wonderful -- knowledgeable about the food, wine, and the variety of tequila available! -- as well as warm and friendly. We were a party of six, celebrating a birthday, and it was the perfect choice of restaurant! Can't wait to go back!
April 5, 2014|Great night out|4|We had dinner with another couple on a Saturday night. The place was filled but didn't seem crowded. There was plenty of space between tables. The entrée special was delicious. The server was very good and kept the food and wine coming as we wanted. I would recommend Red Stripe for a fun night out.
April 5, 2014|April 5 Dinner|4|We ate dinner early on a Saturday night. Food was fantastic and the service was also great. I had a pasta special and my spouse a steak frites. Both were delicious and the cookie pie dessert weas to die for! The menu has a nice mix of offerings, something for everyone. I have had the moules ftites in the past and these are also done very well. Salads were bright and fresh and lovely warm bread on the table. Yummy! As it got later it did get a little loud but we could still hear each other fine. Nice atmosphere and good food, no hesistation to reccommend Red Stripe.
March 30, 2014|Late Lunch|5|The late lunch menu was perfect. We ordered the onion soup and burgers. After enjoying the piping hot, delicious soup...we realized that it was a meal itself! So most of our burgers/fries became a yummy late night snack. I had requested a table near the window in my reservation and they chose the perfect one. Our waiter, Dana, could not have been any pleasanter...we hope to get him again on our return visits.
March 29, 2014|KBLPBP|5|Our experience was fantastic. Our waiter Justin was outstanding!!!!!!! We are planning a return trip and will request his table. Never rushed us and gave us space but was always attentive. My favorite part was when I asked for an Irish Coffee for an after dinner drink he stated that I looked like an original Irish Coffee guy which I am!!!!! Coffee and Jamison. Delicious! Can't wait to return. Thanks, Brian
March 29, 2014|Red Stripe a bit checkered |3|So the room at Red Stripe fills the bill for a fun, lively spot. It looks like a Parisian bistro, unfortunately it devolves into a Providence bistro! Too bad, we have had a good run at a variety of places in Providence. The mussels, which are finished in 10 different styles (one of the main reasons we chose the place), were disappointing: rubbery, overdone. Entrees were similar, no finesse, nothing special. A croque Madame was ok, very little meat - too much cheese and a flavorless hollandaise. A meat pie offering was much less interesting than the menu suggested. I can go on but I don't like ripping restaurants - it may have been a bad night - there are 5 or 6 bistros I can name in Boston that beat this place...'nuf said.
March 27, 2014|Great food, reasonably priced|4|"Great food, reasonably priced and very good service. The only negative is that the restaurant is a bit too ""cozy"" when full. I felt I could jump right into the conversations going on at the tables to my left and right. More privacy please!"
March 22, 2014|Crabby|2|"There were three of us who had lunch. One person ordered a burger which looked delicious. I had some of the fries and they were true "" frites"". Delicious, crisp and hot. The other person had a BLT. It looked pretty good, as well. I, on the other hand made the fatal mistake of ordering the crab cakes. I was undecided between them and the risotto cakes. The waitress said the crab cakes were ""awesome"" With chunks of crabmeat. When they arrived, I was immediately disappointed. The cakes were dark brown and looked as though they had been deep fried in very old oil. They were very flat tasting and I was disappointed with my lunch. They were no chunks of crabmeat, either."
March 9, 2014|Awesome service! waitor couldn't|5|Awesome service! waitor couldn't have been any better. Food was awesome as always!
March 9, 2014|Favorite Brunch Spot|5|We do brunch here for fun, family, out of town guests, special occasions and just because. Excellent food and service. Worth any wait!
March 7, 2014|If you order sandwiches, salads,|3|If you order sandwiches, salads, and muscles, the food is very good. When you go into larger main meals, the food has a tendency to be mercurial. The noise level resulted in having to shout at the people across the table from me. It is much more of a bar atmospherd (loud and noisy) than an eating place.
March 7, 2014|Good food but a bit noisy|5|I have been to Red Strip a number of times and the food and service have always been consistently good. The only problem with the restaurant, particularly in colder weather when the windows are closed is the noise level.
March 5, 2014|Impeccable Service!|5|Couldn't have had a better time! We dined with our parents who were visiting from out of town. They had a delightful time and were excited that there were so many choices! One of our group has many allergies and our waiter, Sean, took the extra time to step her thru the menu. Sean was superb all the way through the evening, and not only was knowledgeable, but also extremely personable. We will be back to sit in his section again!
March 5, 2014|5 Stars Always!!!|5|I've dined here at least a dozen times and never once has the service been bad (even on the busiest of weekends) or has the food been inconsistent. The menu is the right mix of comfort food, perfect portions, and priced right. In a city of many great restaurants Red Stripe is definitely at the top of my list. Also, be sure to check out Mills Tavern the Sister Restaurant of Red Stripe it's AMAZING too!
March 2, 2014|Wonderful food and service|5|Went for an intimate celebration. The food was terrific as always - everything on the menu is solidly good, even when it changes from season to season. We also enjoyed 2 of the cocktails. The waitstaff is very kind and takes the time to know their guests. I have seen the quality of Red Stripe vastly improve over the years and it’s great each time I return!
March 2, 2014|Slow Service Sunday...|3|Was surprised how backed up the kitchen was this past Sunday, our food (along with everyone else's) seemed to take an exorbitant amount of time to come out. Great that the restaurant was busy, but then you must rely on your waitstaff to keep customers informed and content!
March 1, 2014|We were very pleased with|4|We were very pleased with our visit. Had a reservation and was seated immediately when we arrived. The service was excellent and the food was very good. The chowder was very good, the Onion soup was average. The Duck duo was excellent and the Short Rib was very good. The restaurant tends to be a little loud but it was manageable. We will definitely go back.
March 1, 2014|Great food!|4|It was my first time there and I thoroughly enjoyed the food! Everyone I was with liked their orders as well. However, it did a very long time for the food to arrive at the table (granted it was a busy Saturday night).
March 1, 2014|Lively & Tasty Plus GREAT Service|5|We were a group of 7. We made reservations for lunch on March 1st. Our group ranged in age from 30 to 91. Red Stripe is a lively restaurant with a great menu. The clam chowder is delicious! Burgers are huge. Wonderful mussels cooked in many different sauces. Salmon dishes were excellent. Our server, Stephanie was top notch and helped with questions about the menu...never making us feel rushed. We were celebrating a 91st birthday and Red Stripe delivered a dessert with candle much to the delight of my aunt. Red Stripe is quite lively so quiet conversation is not on the menu here. Make reservations so you don't stand at the door. You'll be glad you did.
February 23, 2014|Solid|3|This is our go to. I was very happy the chickens I was planning to make didn't defrost & I had an excuse to visit Red Stripe.
February 17, 2014|Appetizers and salads excellent|4|Found the place by happenstance, went with my wife and we had a nice time--good atmosphere but not too loud that we couldn't have a private conversation without feeling like we were shouting. The choice of appetizers was excellent--we went with the calamari and it was really well-prepared and a good start. My wife had the beet salad and I went with the spinach salad--both of us cleaned our plate. Entrees were up and down--we had a full portion of mussels which was as-advertised (very good) and a house burger which was not as good as recommended. Overall, solid performance and we would return.
February 17, 2014|Red Stripe worth it|3|We had an enjoyable meal at this American brasserie. The service, atmosphere, food and price made this worthwhile. Steak Frites is nice menu option. We will be back.
February 16, 2014|Cacophony|2|"I can see how some reviewers have called this a ""Neighborhood Gem"" because there aren't many options in the area. The food wasn't bad; just not good. My pasta was fine but my friend's rotisserie chicken was not seasoned. With some condiments, that was fixed and became edible. What we couldn't fix was the acoustics. It was so loud in there. The place was packed. You can definitely hear the conversation at the next table. You can also hear the sounds of conversation from all around. Sound bounces off walls and it was cacophony."
February 15, 2014|Great food|4|This was my first time here. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Staff was very friendly. It was very loud and made it difficult to hear the waiter. We kept having him repeat himself. The food came out fast, a little fast for my liking, however it was delicious. We got the duck trio which was a tad too salty and the half chicken with the fries. Both were delicious We will definitely go back again.
February 15, 2014|great mussels|4|Moules et frites with many different sauces...that is one of their signature dishes.
February 14, 2014|Serves late|5|I've reviewed before do no need to go on. Just want to underscore that the kitchen is open until 11:00PM, exceptionally late by RI standards. The food runs from real meals to incredible burgers and pizza. Fries are the best! Even has a frequent guest club shared with Mills Tavern. We often go after Trinity or PPAC. Good selection of wines by glass. Always satisfied
February 14, 2014|Great Place!|4|It's shame I only found this weekend. Arrived before our reservation on Valentine's Day evening...crowded art 9:35, but a few spots at the bar. Bartender was friendly chatty, made our drinks perfectly. Ordered the Risotto Croquettes - two large croquettes that were crunchy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. Just finished and table was ready...ordered Caesar salad to start - it was good, but dressing lacked something. Have had better elsewhere. Then for entrees - Halibut on Risotto (special) and Steak & Frites. Halibut was delicious! Pan-fried with beurre blanc, and the creamy risotto was filled with tomato and basil. Steak unfortunately was overcooked and extremely chewy. And was a little cold. Frites were hot and crispy.
February 14, 2014|Pleasant Evening|4|My husband and I went to Red Stripe on Valentine's Day. The extra menu items were very good - I had the beet salad and the rack of lamb. The lamb was a little chewy but overall tasty. My husband had the french onion soup and beef stroganoff. He enjoyed them both. We shared the red velvet cake which was just right for two. The cocktails and wine were very good. Service was brisk but the waitress was friendly but intrusive. Overall a very nice evening out.
February 14, 2014|Very busy and active environment|4|"Very busy and active environment (in a good way), if you are looking for something quiet this is not it. Staff was excellent and responsive, would have like to see the ""bread person"" more than once since the home made bread was fantastic. I can't say a word that is not positive about the food it too was fantastic. This was our first time there and we definately will return, this is a must try."
February 14, 2014|Excellant Food|4|Variety of high quality food. Excellent service, quick, humorous, thorough.
February 14, 2014|Great Food and Great Service|5|From the appetizer to the entree to the dessert, everything was wonderful. Even the bread deserves mentioning. Service was excellent. An all around great meal. Would definitely go back.
February 14, 2014|Wouldn't Change A Thing|5|Service was excellent, food was delicious. We were seated promptly (on Valentines night) and our waiter was very attentive.
February 8, 2014|Great local find|5|We wanted to try some Providence restaurants, and picked this one. We arrived 15 min early and were seated right away. Our waiter, Jacob, was terrific. Food was excellent, especially the fresh baked bread. We will try this one again in the summer, when it looks like they can open the glass doors to the sidewalk!
February 8, 2014|Bad night|2|There must have been changes since my last visit. The food was not up to par. Hummus in the appetizer was not edible, due to the salt. Steak was below average, not cooked to request and extremely salty. Service was not attentive as well.
February 7, 2014|Great neighborhood restaurant|5|Good is great and the atmosphere is lively, but a little too loud for intimate conversation.All in all a dining experience.
February 6, 2014|Crab cakes were imitation|4|Crab cakes were imitation crab meat. Came out burnt on the outside, cold on the inside. Short rib entree and duck shepherds pie were both delicious. Creme brulee was great. Disappointed by the app, no table visit by management for substandard food. Sangria was decent, espresso martinis were great. Service pretty good. Would like it a little more personalized.
February 1, 2014|Great Last Minute Dinner!|5|I decided to book at Red Stripe because I have never been let down with the food served here. Aaron our server was polite, patient and was right on top of our drinks and plates. He made the dinner more enjoyable. The Beef Stroganoff was amazingly tender and rich, the crab cakes were meaty, and the frites were a great addition. Go visit Red Stripe!
Dined on February 1, 2014|Fun spot for excellent food|5|Menu is varied but not overwhelming, and would please carnivores, vegetarians and seafood lovers equally well. I especially liked the selection of moules et frites, mussels steamed with your choice of seasoning/broth, in a covered silver bowl that is uncovered with a flourish at table -- accompanied by hot shoestring fries. My husband's steak was as good as any from one of the high end steak houses. Staff is knowledgeable about wine, red wine special was great, service is quick and friendly.
February 1, 2014|Great first time at Red Stripe!|5|My wife and I took our college hockey playing daughter and a teammate, we all loved the food and our waiter was outstanding in service and made the evening fun and special! Have recommended to others and will for sure do Red Stripe on our next trip to Providence / Friartown!
February 1, 2014|Love those mussels|5|Have been here many times, food and service always great. Start with the Portugese mussels for an app., then the Seafood Paella if you are a seafood lover.
February 1, 2014|Superb & Delicious|5|We've been to Red Stripe 4 times and have 4 favorite dishes! Great food and Great service.
January 28, 2014|Excellent food and service-|5|Excellent food and service- have never been disappointed by Red Stripe!
January 25, 2014|Best good I've had in a long time!|5|Food was absolutely amazing. Menu had a nice selection, but it wasn't overwhelming. I got the Shepherds pie with duck and it was so delicious, well cooked, and seasoned. My husband got the duck confit and it was perfectly moist. Great food!
January 25, 2014|We were a group of 8 coming|5|We were a group of 8 coming from a Basket Ball game at the Dunkin Donut's Center for a late lunch at Red Stripe . Short ride to the restuarant, available on street parking (this was 3pm on a Saturday). Loved that they sat us at a round table for 8 people, menu is simple (who needs all those choices anyway!) but covers all options, (salad, sandwich, burger, pasta). Great atmosphere for a group, prices are really good, burgers huge and delicious!
January 24, 2014|Good food at a reasonable price!|4|"We hadn't been to Red Stripe in a while, but were immediately reminded of why we always liked it. The food is good, though not of ""food as art"" quality...more comfort than gourmet. The prices are pretty reasonable by current standards and the service is excellent. Only complaint is that it tends to be noisier and a lot more active than we would prefer. The high energy level is appealing to many, but it can get a little too ""crazy"" for our tastes. Our party ordered the steak frites and short ribs...both were plentiful and very good. We'll be back, and we recommend others do the same..."
January 24, 2014|Come hungry - portions are|4|Come hungry - portions are substantial. Tomato soup & grilled cheese even better than Mom's! Fish & chips also good comfort food!
January 14, 2014|Good, was once spectacular|4|I understand that this is take on a particular type of Belgian restaurant : tin ceilingswhiteshirted waiters , moules and steak frites. It's very good, and I go there regularly, but I think the food has slipped a notch or two in the past year or two. Bowl of mussels used to be massive, now adequate ; frites used to be amazing now just better than average.still worthwhile . Moules and steal frites are best bet. Our waiter was very attentive this visit.
January 11, 2014|Good menu choices with eclectic|4|Good menu choices with eclectic and inspired ingredients. Restaurant noise (on a Saturday night) was extremely loud and uncomfortable. A busy, popular, friendly restaurant on Providence's East Side.
January 5, 2014|Consistently outstanding!|5|Every time we come, whether for lunch, dinner or brunch, always a great experience. Love the food, service is impeccable, always a great experience. Thank you!
January 4, 2014|Love it!|5|One of my favorite restaurants in Providence. Great food! Relaxed, laid-back feeling.
January 3, 2014|Great deal for gourmet dishes|5|I was very impressed. The menu has a really nice variety of food and prices. The Mains were great deals in my opinion. How often do you see main courses like short Ribs and rack of lamb for under $25? I appreciate that they also have burgers and sandwiches if you feel like having a nice night out, but don't want to break the bank. Great service too! We'll be back!
January 3, 2014|Rack of Lamb Special|4|My husband and I visit the Red Stripe about 3 times per month. We always sit in Stephanie's section - she is great - very friendly and provides excellent service. Normally there are not many (if any) specials to choose from but on that Friday night there was a New Zealand rack of lamb with garlic green bean special. It was delicious! The lamb was juicy and perfectly cooked and the accompanying sauce was fantastic. I would definitely order it often if it became a regular menu item.
December 31, 2013|Good food, good ambiance and|5|Good food, good ambiance and service - what is not to like!
December 31, 2013|Always a good meal|4|have been to Red Stripe several times - the food and the service were very good as usual, the restaurant noisy and energetic. Worth the trip.
December 31, 2013|Very good food with a varied|4|Very good food with a varied menu and good service. Noise level was only downside.
December 30, 2013|Surprisingly busy on a Monday night|5|Went for dinner on the night before New Year's Eve. It was a Monday night so we didn't expect the restaurant to be so busy, even though it was a holiday week. Usually the night before New Year's is a little quiet. The restaurant was full and very busy. Even so, we had a great time. We had a reservation and were seated immediately when we arrived. Our server was attentive throughout the evening, without being annoying. We've eaten at the restaurant a number of times in the past, so we're pretty familiar with the menu. No surprises - everything was very good.
December 28, 2013|First Visit|4|We were looking for a place that was more kid-friendly to have a. If hot out to celebrate the holidays . Red Stripe exceeded all expectations. From the bread service, to the local beer on tap, to the menu with at least 6 entrees I wanted to try, to the ridiculously good creme brûlée, it was a fun, delicious eating experience. Although it was crowded by the time we finished our meal, our party of six had plenty of room and the noise level. Definitely recommend a trip to Wayland Square for dinner!
December 26, 2013|Suprisingly great|5|Reasonably priced wine list, excellent service, good food and a great menu made this a dinning experience that stood out.
December 26, 2013|Excellent choice!|5|We were meeting friends from California and Massachusetts for lunch and I was appointed to find a restaurant in Providence where we could have good food, not be rushed and could linger to talk. I am from Connecticut and not familiar with local restaurants so I turned to my friends on FB and ended up with reservations at Red Stripe. It was excellent!! All were happy. We had a great server who was professional and attentive and helped make our reunion lunch a special occasion. The price was very reasonable,too. Bonus!
December 24, 2013|Christmas Eve Dinner|5|Every year, our family chooses a different restaurant for our Christmas Eve dinner. This year we chose a family favorite,Red Stripe. In reserving a table for the evening, I neglected to specify a certain table and we were given a booth. We asked to change the location and immediately were given a perfect table with a wonderful window view. Dana, our server was just wonderful, the food delicious as always.....we just might change our tradition and return to Red Stripe next year, too!
December 21, 2013|The food was great and the|5|The food was great and the drinks were wonderful, the staff was so nice, happy and enjoyed us being there. This is truly a neighborhood Gem.
December 17, 2013|Delightful in all respects|4|It took me a while to get around to dining here even though it has been on my radar for quite a while. So many enticing choices on the menu it was difficult to decide, but ultimately went for the Croque Madame, something I really like when done well. Have to say Red Stripe one was as good as any I have been served in Paris bistros! The arancini balls we shared as an appetizer were large and very tasty. Prices are reasonable, service was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return soon with my husband and go for one of their mussels offerings.
December 13, 2013|Late Night qualified|4|Kitchen open until 11:00 which, by RI standards, suffices for late night. One of the few places one can get served after Ppac or Trinity. Very few folks there after 11:45/12:00. Creature of habit, I always get the Croque Madame with a glass of red wine, of which there is a pretty good choice.
December 7, 2013|Linguine & clams could use|4|Linguine & clams could use some chopped clams added to the pasta, in addition to the whole clams. Fish & chips loaded with more pommes frittes than could be consumed in one sitting.
December 6, 2013|December 6 dinner|4|We were two couples with a reservation for 8 p.m. on Friday night. The restaurant was full, and the noise level was high. We were seated at a window looking out onto Angell Street. Our server Dana did a great job: friendly, knowledgeable, attentive (but not too much so). We were all happy with our meals, and the only complaint we had was that the noise level was very high. But it is not surprising given that the restaurant is modeled as a French bistro with tile floors. We will definitely return on a night when it is not so crowded.
December 5, 2013|R. S. Grilled Cheese. Enough said.|5|I say that I am going to order something different, just can't bring myself to actually do it. The frites and that special little sauce is just heaven. I live in NK and do miss the Red Stripe being in Narragansett. When I need my fix, I call my friend from Barrington and it is a perfect lunch spot.
December 1, 2013|good food and service|4|Excellent brunch selection food cooked as requested. All plates empty and bellies happy
November 30, 2013|Simply fantastic|5|This was my second time dining at Red Stripe. The restaurant itself has a great vibe. We were sat promptly ans service was great throughout. Food was delicious. It came our at perfect times so there wasn't excessive waiting between courses. Id highly recommend the meatloaf and the risotto croquettes, and from what I heard from the others I was dining with the hummus tabbouleh and babaganoush plate was fantastic. We will definitely be back.
November 29, 2013|I always take people to Red Stripe.|3|So I booked a table for 7 with a 2 o'clock RESERVATION on Friday....it was packed and we had to stand in the cramped entry for 45 minutes...awkward and annoying. They did comp our appetizers, however lately, and not only on this occasion, there is an attitude that needs adjusting, from the front, to the barmaid, to the waiters. I'm rethinking my normal hangout, however I love the menu and the overall vibe of the place. Better place with just a friend and not a group
November 24, 2013|Sunday Brunch|5|Went this morning for brunch, and the food was excellent. The BBQ Pork Hash was amazing.
November 23, 2013|We had pleasant experience|4|We had pleasant experience at Red Stripe. The calamari was absolutely amazing. Quite honestly some of the best that we have had. Certainly speaks to the Rhode Island tradition. The croquettes were slightly overcooked on the outside, although the rissotto filling was delicious. The decor matched the Brasserie theme, elegant and casual. Service was good, nothing extraordinary, but certainly sufficient and efficient. I would recommend Red Stripe confidently to anyone. Great Wayland Square Gem!!!!
November 17, 2013|Service|3|Even though the restaurant was about half full the wait time for our lunch was close to 45minutes
November 16, 2013|Awesome|5|We had a great experience Saturday night. Really glad we had a reservation. The place was jammed. Great food, great service. In and out in an hour with appetizers and meal, but didn't feel rushed.
November 16, 2013|Atypical, but still very good.|3|This last visit was solid, but it took a very long time to get our entrées & the portions were noticeably smaller than usual. I had ordered the stroganoff previously when it was a special & had received 3 HUGE pieces of short-rib, this time the pieces were tiny, still plenty for me ... I did not go hungry. We enjoyed our meals, the ambience & each other. We didn't think the wait was worth whining about. We were surprised when the manager came over & apologized for the wait & took care of our bar tab. My mind was blown. This is why we keep coming back. The food is always great, but the service is amazing & I believe as a team they try to anticipate the guest's feelings on their experience & make sure we leave happy.
November 11, 2013|Our family go-to place|4|"Great chicken fingers, fish n chips and Mac and cheese for kids amongst other choices. Famous for amazing grilled cheese and tomato soup. Great selection overall and we are big fans of the ""Eiffel Tower"" drink. Good spot."
November 7, 2013|Consistent|5|Excellent service , food and drinks. I have never had a bad meal which is the reason I continue to return time after time. This Bistro makes its French cousins pale because of the consistency in service, food and drink.
October 30, 2013|Slow but delicious|4|The food was beautifully prepared, but we had to wait about 30 minutes between salads and the entree, which I felt was too long. It seemed especially long since my companion had not ordered a salad, and neither of us eats bread, so she had no food all that time. My salmon was beautifully prepared, though, and the rabe had a very nice flavor. My friend said her burger was definitely worth the wait, and the place has a fun atmosphere. I trust restaurants heavily patronized by locals, and this is definitely a neighborhood hangout.
Dined on October 27, 2013|Reliable Neighborhood Eatery|5|"We live 3 blocks away, and Red Stripe is our ""go to place"" on short notice. They have the best burgers in Providence as well as a wide range of moules frites. The menu is quite varied from comfort food to semi-haute cuisine. This was our second trip in the past 2 weeks. It is outstanding, reliable, and reasonably priced. Red Stripe never disappoints."
October 22, 2013|Reliable everyday & special meal|5|Best burgers in town. Mussels are unequalled. Frites are as they should be. With diet conscious folks, excellent side salad may be substituted for frites. Limited but lovely sidewalk seating during pleasant weather. A bit noisy at times.
October 19, 2013|A Providence Favorite|5|My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years as Red Stripe loyalists. The food is always fantastic; the service is stellar; the ambiance is upscale, but fun. The manager even paid for my boyfriend's beer when it spilled due to the wobbly table leg. We'll be back again soon.
October 19, 2013|parents weekend|4|My husband and my daughter and I enjoyed an amazing dinner this past weekend. It was my daughters college parents weekend and she said having a special dinner was the cap of the experience. Food was excellent, service was excellent , it is loud but energetic. Parking was easy which in the city is huge plus!
October 13, 2013|Pleasantly Pleased|5|My husband, myself and and an out of town guest all dined at Red Stripe this past weekend and found the service and food both to be excellent!!!!! We had reservations and were sat upon arrival. Our server Matt was quite helpful with our wine selection as well as appetizers. His knowledege of the menu was very helpful since our quest is limited to a gluten free diet. We are looking to our next visit to Red Strip.
October 12, 2013|Home Away from Home|5|This has become our haunt. We bring the kids, we don't bring the kids, either way, it's a great spot. The food is always top notch. I opted for a special instead of the mussels I usually get. I was not disappointed the short ribs stroganoff was outstanding. There was so much left over that we shared it for lunch the next day.
October 9, 2013|Solid choice|4|Food is always very good, service the same and the place is just cool. This is a solid and certainly safe choice as I have never been disappointed, and Ive been coming here for years.
October 5, 2013|Enjoyed|4|Went with my companiera. We appreciated the variety of food and meal options. Delicious overall. Loved the bread. Wished some food options didn't have meat - like the fish soups. This would have allowed me to share with my friend who doesn't eat 4-legged animals. Service was pleasant, friendly. Zuppa with shellfish was yummy. Shepherd's pie with duck confit was really good.
October 5, 2013|Fantastic atmosphere and food!|4|"This was my second visit here. I obviously liked it the first time, but it was even better the second time around, Both my partner and I loved our food. The bread was amazing, our cocktails were great and our entrees were even better. I had the salmon special and the salmon was cooked to perfection. My partner loved her ""everything but the kitchen sink salad"". We plan on returning with friends to share this terrific neighborhood restaurant. The atmosphere is great. The only drawback might be the noise level if you're looking for quiet conversation. It was a bit loud both visits, but I'm sure it varies. I definitely recommend Red Stripe for a date night or dinner with friends."
October 5, 2013|Good food|4|Started with a glass of prosecco that seemed a little flat to the server. Without even asking, she brought a new glass over which was great. Food was wonderful and a great way to start a holiday weekend.
September 29, 2013|Great Place!!|5|We love this place! Best Mussels in the area!! Many varieties of steaming broths. We recently went here with eight people Food and service was wonderful! We had a variety of apps and entrees The only thing I would say is that there is not much difference between the sweet potato latke and sweet potatoe hash. The hash was a bit simple and was over cooked - it could be seasoned better. We all had a great time!!
September 28, 2013|RhodyRick|5|"Had great meal at Red Stripe. Saturday night is extremely busy, but reservations made it easy. All meals enjoyed by our foursome and service was very good. Red Stripe is noisy, but lively and tolerable. ""Moules and Frites"" forever!"
September 26, 2013|Great clams|5|Food was lovely. Had a local Rhode Island dish of clams and linguini. Delicious. But the service outshined everything else! Bryan was wonderful explained everything and recommended a good bourdeaux and also had good conversation. Service is looking up at red stripe!
September 26, 2013|Love the gem in out neighborhood|5|Had a lovely meal with a friend catching up. Mussels and frites were delicious. Service was excellent Bryan the bartender took greT care of us and even gave us some good recommendations for next time.
September 23, 2013|Our favorite go to spot!|4|Having moved to the neighborhood recently we've tried all of the restaurants in walking distance. This is, by far, our favorite! The food is consistently delicious, the service excellent (ask for Stephanie!). We haven't been on Sunday for Brunch yet - but hear it's the best around. Note: Reservations aren't required - but I highly recommend them (you'll get a better seat & you can request your server) It can get a liitle noisy (energetic) but, personally, we find that part of it's charm!
September 22, 2013|Home away from home|5|I can't say enough how much I love this place, we can bring the kids or come a little later in the evening alone. The food & service is excellent & it is very affordable at the same time. Viva la Red Stripe.
September 22, 2013|Sunday Brunch|4|Great spot for a not-so-quiet Sunday brunch with friends - selections were just different enough and well prepared - everyone went home happy!
September 21, 2013|never disappointed here !|5|Excellent service and excellent food combine in a lively neighborhood spot! Tried the new sausage appetizer - two different types of grilled sausage served with three dipping sauces and a neat pretzel bread - OH YUM! We always enjoy this restaurant, whether its a dinner for two, or with the whole family.
September 21, 2013|Red Stripe|3|Found this gem a few weeks ago and loved it. Fun for a couple or a bit larger group. It's quite loud which is a warning to any folks who are looking for a quiet night out. We really enjoyed it. Great service with Brian. Johnny on the spot without hovering. Food was excellent. The lavendar brick chicken was awesome!
September 14, 2013|Red stripe|4|Nice menu....portoguese stew was awesome... I would like to return and try some of the mussel dishes.
September 12, 2013|Street Life|4|Matt was a fantastic waiter, the food and wine were great. NYC wanna be drivers made for a noisy outdoor dinner (Thursday night 7ish). Indoor dining next time!
September 7, 2013|charming ambiance|4|Well prepared food and wonderful service with an outdoor eating option. Noise level high when restaurant is full
September 6, 2013|Good comfort food - tomato|4|Good comfort food - tomato soup and grilled cheese, although soup was a little too spicy for my taste. Clams and linguine always a favorite as fresh clams are a nice addition.
September 3, 2013|Mussels are great and so is Bryan|3|Wonderful mussels and Waldorf salad and even better service ask for Bryan. He's great!
August 24, 2013|best grilled cheese|5|The red stripe grilled cheese will change how you look at grilled cheese forever
August 21, 2013|We had a party of 8 and we|4|We had a party of 8 and we seated immediately even though we arrived early. Everyone in our diverse group enjoyed the food and thought the service was very good. We all had a very good experience.
August 16, 2013|good|3|We sat down when we arrived. Waitstaff were great. most of our dishes were very good. The one exception was the risotto, every time we have it, its different. This time it was VERY heavy cheesy . But we will be back, great menu.
August 9, 2013|Great little spot|5|I went here for the first time and I was very satisfied. It has a nice ambiance, service was good...there were a lot of people so it wasn't too quick but the waitress was attentive. The food was fantastic, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It is expensive though, so be prepared to spend some money. A dinner for three with appetizers for everyone, a bottle of wine and entrees came out to about $200.
August 9, 2013|Super|5|Service from entering door seating wait staff and food service excellent.......... third time there and will be back NICE
August 7, 2013|Great neighborhood bistro|4|You can count on Red Stripe to deliver. The service, food, and ambience are all great. Don't go if you are with a group and need to really hear the conversation; the acoustics are tough.
July 28, 2013|The food was very good, menu|4|The food was very good, menu was varied with many good choices. There were 6 of us and we all enjoyed our meals.
July 28, 2013|Typically fabulous.|3|Red Stripe is a favorite. This time we were seated in a booth in the back ... I didn't mind it, but my husband didn't care for it. The food was fantastic. The service wasn't up to their usual standard ... I'd tell you that the waitress we had was new.
July 21, 2013|Great Bistro|5|One of our favorite reasonably price high quality restaurants. You'll love it too.
July 17, 2013|Great food, local joint|4|Bread was warm and delicious. Had the Shepards pie (made with duck) it was great. The menu is extensive, there is something for everyone.
July 13, 2013|Fantastic Food and Service|5|We stumbled upon Red Stripe on Open Table. We are so glad we tried them!! We have been there two weekends in a row and the food and service have been excellent!! Red Stripe has a casual feel but the food is upscale and perfectly prepared! I had the brick chicken with sage polenta and my husband had the meatloaf - both were outstanding. The french onion soup is one of the best out there! On our second outing I had the smoked salmon plate and the croque madam with a couple of specialty drinks. My husband had the Steak Frite (hanger steak with crispy, pefectly cook french fries). Outstanding! We love our server, Vanessa, whom we asked for on the second outing. Very friendly, professional and attentive. Great location! Would highly recommend!!
July 11, 2013|This is one of our favorites! But..|3|We love Red Stripe but the mussels e.g. Moules/Frites this time were disappointing. They were not nearly as big as we have gotten in the past and we asked for additional cilantro which usually is no problem but this time we got very little. We asked for more and the waiter got it immediately. We hope that they find a new mussel purveyor as we won't be ordering it in the future and it is a signature dish. Otherwise, the service was fabulous and the frites were delicious! Perhaps the mussel purveyor is picking the mussels when they are too small? We look forward to returning once again and will keep our fingers crossed that we get larger mussels next time.
July 4, 2013|Cocktails, appetizers, entrees|3|Cocktails, appetizers, entrees and desert were all very tasty. Unfortunately, the air conditioning was not working on the evening we had dinner at Red Stripe so it was quite warm and a bit uncomfortable. That said, the food was delicious and the staff was very welcoming and attentive. We will definitely visit this establishment again.
July 1, 2013|Good sandwiches|3|Went there for dinner and had the open face steak sandwich. It was good. Fries were not very crispy even though I asked for well done. My BF got the grilled cheese Red Stripe and he thought it was very good. Solid choice near Wayland Square.
June 29, 2013|A Providence/Wayland Square Classic|5|Red Stripe never fails to disappoint when it comes to dinner. Whether it's their classic moules and frites selection, the delicious paella or the duo duck confit, you'll be satisfied with your meal at this American/Belgian brasserie. Reserved for a weekend dinner party of 8 a day before with no problems (albeit in June). The service is friendly and the ambiance is classy but casual (a New Yorker would feel right at home). I wish I could balance my review with a criticism but I have none (perhaps that it can be difficult to get a table without a reservation? Especially if it's a large party?). I consider Red Stripe an old standby and one of my favorite restaurants in Providence.
June 23, 2013|Excellent as always - must|5|Excellent as always - must try the Red Stripe Mussels and the Striped Martini! Everything on the menu is delish. Love our waitress Stephanie! :)
Dined on June 16, 2013|Neighborhood gem. Paris bistro|5|Neighborhood gem. Paris bistro feel. Excellent menu; good drinks and wine list; excellent service.
June 14, 2013|New appetizer is a 'must try'|4|The Red Stripe has added a sausage board appetizer to their updated menu. It is absolutely fantastic. The selection seems to change daily but both times we ordered the board we were delighted. They serve the sausages with home-made pretzel bread which is warm and delicious.
June 8, 2013|Nice Neighborhood Gem|5|This restaurant came as a recommendation from a colleague, It was perfect for our pre-theatre dinner. It had a very nice menu selection offering starters, small plates as well as full dinners. My husband started with the Iceberg Wedge Waldorf Salad, which had a great dressing over nice crisp iceberg lettuce and for his main course he had paella. The yummy saffron rice was chuck full of shellfish, chicken and charizo. He has a pretty hearty appetite and there was plenty, enough to even take some home. I started with the Sauteed Broccoli Rabe. What great flavor. The Rabe was not bitter at all and the olives and tomatoes were a nice addition. For Dinner I had the Nicoise Salad, I substituted the dressing for the house dressing. Yummy!
June 6, 2013|Local, energetic and good.|4|Energetic scene. Great for Soup-n-sandwich locally.
May 27, 2013|Always a winner|5|We've been to Red Stripe many times and we always find it to be fantastic. There were 4 of us and we all enjoyed our meals tremendously.
May 27, 2013|Stripe Noisy|3|Service lackadaisical. Certainly have had better. Noisy- note I do not like noise with food.
May 22, 2013|GO, GO, GO!|5|Red stripe is a great restaurant. The service was excellent (the manager was super nice and knew how to handle situations). The food is very unique and delicious. The grilled cheese with tomato soup is excellent, and the seafood paella is really delicious with lots of seafood and well cooked saffron rice. I definitely recommend this restaurant!
May 18, 2013|Special night, special dinner|4|I went there with my family following my college graduation ceremony last weekend. We were seated early, given great service and advice by the server, and had a wonderful meal. Staff was helpful, but not invasive or pushy. Fresh baked bread from a local bakery was personally delivered to each of us, starting the night out on just the right note. The appetizer plate was expansive and delicious, and other diners at the table enjoyed their chowder, salads, and drinks. Entrees were plentiful, even a bit too big, but delivered warm and deliciously to the table. The dessert menu, which we were too full to take more than a glance at, might have benefited from a bit more pizzaz to compliment the unique cuisine, but I'd definitely return!
May 13, 2013|Mussels and frites|5|"I am addicted to the mussels - have had the ""Normande"" on several occasions. So delicious!"
May 11, 2013|Saturday Night Dinner|5|Fantastic experience. The service was impeccable and the food tremendous. Was it a little loud? Yes...sure... But it wasn't like I couldn't hear across the table. I plan on going back very soon.
May 2, 2013|Great spot..full range of food|5|Great spot for a gathering of friends, or a nice dinner for two. It has the full range from burgers to more upscale fare. The wine list is long and reasonable.
April 29, 2013|"Special Features:
Kid-Friendly,"|5|Special Features: Kid-Friendly, Neighborhood Gem, Special Occasion, Great for Lunch Your Review: It was such a perfect day, Red Stripe had its large front window open! It was great to feel a gentle breeze and hear the outdoor sounds while still being in the comfortable restaurant. As usual the food was delicious. Even my picky 4 year old nephew ate his Mac and Cheese with gusto! Our waiter, Aaron, was very attentive. A candle-lit piece of birthday cake for my sister topped off a wonderful birthday lunch.

April 28, 2013|Drinks arrived one by one|2|"Drinks arrived one by one served by different servers over seemingly a long time and well after we ordered entres. Food was average except for the bread (best bread!) and mussels that come with different broths to soak bread in. Food came out randomly so our group of eight had to wait out of courtesy, hence cold fries etc. Hostesses seemed stressed and never smiled. Servers the same and hurried so didn't explain food other than ""it's good"". We ate there on a Sunday night."
April 21, 2013|The menu has plenty to offer|3|The menu has plenty to offer and I enjoyed my salad with wood grilled salmon but others in my party were less excited by their meals. Fish and chips was good but not exceptional. Half chicken with lemon sage came out looking like it had been fried over - there was a crispy, dry skin and a side bowl of a gravy with a slice of lemon sitting in the bottom of it. Looking around, looks like there are plenty of good options on the menu, but we didn't hit gold with all of our choices.
April 20, 2013|superb place, much too noisy|4|Really good food, really knowledgeable and helpful wait staff, great location, terribly noisy if there are more then a few tables in use.We avoid Red Stripe unless we can get in before the crowd; the noise level is just awful. The combination of a hard floor, no carpet, a hard ceiling, and absolutely no sound absorption materials anywhere makes it tough to enjoy the really superb food.
April 14, 2013|Mediocre Bar Food|2|The setting is fun and in a cute neighborhood, but food just wasn't very good. Sweet potato latkes that were fat and mushy. Paella with dried out chorizo and rubbery seafood. An onion soup that one member of our party couldn't eat because it was so greasy (she told the waitress, but the waitress did not offer to get her something else or comp the soup). At best, I would call this mediocre bar food.
April 14, 2013|Terrific restaurant. Had|5|Terrific restaurant. Had brunch there with a large group--everyone was delighted with the choices and the food. Our waitress was outstanding, kept on top of everything and had a great sense of humor about it. I look forward to going back to Red Stripe.
April 13, 2013|Fantastic menu - couldn't|5|Fantastic menu - couldn't devide what to order, but went with the mussels. Had a reservation for 6, sat ummediately and was greeted with water, delicious fresh bread and an immediate drink order. The waiter was knowledgable, pleasant and efficient. The entrees were all fresh and tasty. All of my guests loved their food and loved their experience.
April 12, 2013|We had impeccable service|5|We had impeccable service from Dana from the moment we sat down to the moment we paid the bill. Everything was timely and the food was delicious. I never regret coming to Red Stripe.
April 6, 2013|Red Stripe is our go-to place|5|Red Stripe is our go-to place when we're in town visiting our daughter at Brown. With enough time, we can reserve a table for 6 to include many of her friends. At the height of meal time, it can be noisy but the last time I was there, we went after a performance at 9:30 and it was calm and quiet. I love the food, I usually order one of the many mussel dishes but last time I went for the seared tuna for something a bit lighter since it was so late, the tuna was perfectly cooked although I wish the julienne veggies had come with a little less peanut sauce for a lighter taste. The kids wanted a taste of home so they went for the Lavender Brick Chicken and the Meat and potatoes so everyone was happy!
April 6, 2013|The food is good. The wine|3|The food is good. The wine list is very limited. The worst thing is on a Saturday night it's too loud to hear anyone speak. We only had four people and I was hoarse when we left from trying to make myself heard over the din. Even the waiter misheard every item I ordered! They need sound blocks or carpets.
April 6, 2013|Lunch portions too large.|3|Lunch portions too large. Could only eat 1/2 a sandwich but on Saturdays the 1/2 sandwich with either soup or salad choice wasn't available.

March 31, 2013|The food was good, not great.|3|The food was good, not great. By the time our food was brought to the table, it was luke warm and the coffee was cold. I have eaten at Red Stripe for dinner and loved it, brunch, not so much.
March 24, 2013|Red Stripe is definitely a|5|Red Stripe is definitely a neighborhood gem. The kind of place you almost don't want to tell others about, because it will get too busy. We have eaten there twice recently and have loved everything we had. The Steak Frites are especially good, if you are looking for red meat. The service is attentive, knowledgeable and friendly - a great combination in this kind of restaurant.
March 23, 2013|Disappointed|2|I have been dining at Red Stripe since they opened years ago. The food has always been good for the price. With the exception of the roasted beet salad with blue cheese, everything was off. Duck confit in the shepherd's pie was dry and tasteless. Even the bread, which is usually outstanding, was stale.
March 23, 2013|BAD BURGERS!!|4|I have been to Red Stripe several times and enjoyed the many meals I've eaten there. I finally tried their 10 oz. hamburger and was extremely disappointed. I ordered it medium rare and it was well done and very dry. In addition to the burger being over cooked, the bun was hard and dry as well. I will eat there again, however I will never order another hamburger there again.
March 21, 2013|Good restaurant. Great food.|4|Had brunch here for the first time and had a pleasant experience. Restaurant was crowded as usual and the food was delicious. Good service, not great. Seems like a family-oriented place as there were many children and infants everywhere. Good for groups.
March 16, 2013|Surprised that such a great|5|Surprised that such a great restaurant is in a neighborhood setting rather than a more downtown setting. Definitely will go back again. Very small and tight seating so not good for group
March 16, 2013|Entree special of rack of|3|Entree special of rack of lamb was delicious and cooked to perfection...only thing missing was mint jelly - not available. Lamb shank menu item also very good, and paired well with brussels sprouts.
March 12, 2013|Used to be a great spot|3|I don't understand what has changed with Red Stripe. I know the ownership has but the food has really gone downhill. It's becoming more of a corporate restaurant type feel not the cozy east side restaurant I used to love. The menu hasn't changed in a very long time and they don't ever have lunch specials. I feel like they need to revamp something's in order to compete with the restaurants in providence that are always doing new and creative things. The service there is what it is. The waiter actually slide the butter across the table at us I had to catch it. He was nice but have a little more charm with your customers. The tomato soup which I used to love had a metallic taste. Stick with moulés and frites. They can't mess them up.

March 3, 2013|Reliable and good for big parties|3|Fun spot to take large groups, especially with children or teens. Convivial atmosphere and lively but sometimes gets too loud. They have a pretty flexible menu which would appeal to most people. Very reliable in general.
March 2, 2013|Red Stripe is a fun, vibrant|5|Red Stripe is a fun, vibrant neighborhood restaurant. They advertise as an American Brasserie, which is very accurate. Our server was just the right amount of attentive, and was knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is noisy and the tables were a bit too close together, but it was still a good choice for a group (there were 6 of us). We plan to return again.
March 2, 2013|We were a little disappointed|3|We were a little disappointed with the food which we thought was heavy (a lot fried and creamy food). I didn't think that the cooking was especially inspired. The chocolate dessert that others at the table had was very enthusiastically received. This restaurant is noisy, but there is nice energy. I would go back, but would try to pick other food items next time. The waitress was very nice and hard-working.
March 1, 2013|The food was good, but the|3|The food was good, but the service was poor and despite making a reservation 5 days in advance, our table was in a crummy corner near the kitchen. This was a terrific disappointment. If the waitress insists on memorizing what people order, she better get it right. She didn't. It took five minutes to flag down our waitress just to tell her the meal was incorrect, and then it was another 10 minutes of watching my peers eat their meals before the waitress thought about offering me a salad while I waited.
March 1, 2013|Good food, but bad table|3|The restaurant was packed, we had to wait a few minutes for our table to be ready, but our hearts sank when we were seated in an awkward corner. There was maybe one foot of space between the table next to us, which made it feel like we were dining with the other party. It was very tight to get to our seats, and difficult for the servers as well.

February 22, 2013|everything about the dinner|4|everything about the dinner was great...the dessert of creme brulee was not up to par, it was of almost a cheesecake consistency. and the fresh fruit garnish was 3 less then fresh blueberries.

February 16, 2013|It was good for a young couple|4|It was good for a young couple to have a special night out. While it wasn't in our budget to go on a regular Saturday, it was not outrageous either. The food was delicious, and the staff was attentive. The worst thing about the experience is that the restaurant is quite loud, and while it was not a huge issue for us as a couple, I could see/hear larger groups struggling to yell over the collective noise to be heard at their own table. TL;DR: Good food, good service, a bit loud.

February 14, 2013|Red stripe valentine day|2|Where do I start. I went with a group of four during valentine day and I though the ambiance was amazing. The food was not good at all. The appetizer usually is enough to fulfill the entire table but we ordered a crab cake which was the only good food that night but the portion was horrible. Since when is appetizer just two crab cakes. ( we had to cut it into four pieces ) now the actual food comes quick and its all made on the stop this according to the waiter who to,d be my sauce was made from scratch. My friend and I ordered the burger which was to big to eat I had to cut it with a knife like usual but it still wasn't enough. The meat was not seasoned and I told the waiter well done and it was rare. My friend ordered steak which was good
February 14, 2013|We were there Valentine's|4|"We were there Valentine's Day for dinner. Both my husband and I had the prix fixe dinner. We both had the potato leek soup which was delicious. I don't usually order meat, but the rack of lamb tempted me and was excellent, My husband had the blue crab stuffed ravioli which he enjoyed immensely. It's a warm, comfortable atmosphere, a little on the ""lively"" side, but we were able to have a conversation. We had an excellent waiter. We would definitely return. My only criticism was that I felt a little rushed."
February 14, 2013|Great bistro fare|4|Always great bistro fare and service. Their Red Stripe Grilled Cheese sandwich is extraordinary.

The restaurant is are rare combination of family friendly and casual elegance. Paid parking is available in the lot behind the restaurant, but it's easy enough to park on the adjacent streets for free. Highly recommended.
February 4, 2013|Get the Mussels!|5|Aside from amazing food (mouthwatering Sourdough Bread, Mussels, Garlic Broccoli Rabe), what made this meal so enjoyable was truly the service. The waitor even advised me to go with a different wine for the same price with less of an acidic finish. He was very attentive to our group of 6 and we all felt no pressure to leave upon finishing our food. Overall, a wonderful experience.

January 25, 2013|This was my first time at|5|"This was my first time at Red Stripe and I was very impressed. I loved the decor and the restaurant had an energetic buzz. The sounds of others conversations did not drown out your own. The waiter was attentive, polite and had a good sense of humor. The food was excellent both in presentation and taste. My only ""complaint"" is that a glass of ""house"" wine was $9; a bit steep considering the price point of the entrees. I have driven by this restaurant numerous times without realizing it was there; better signage might have helped. Apparently, this does not hinder their business as the place was hopping! I will defintely be coming back."
January 19, 2013|Red Stripe is really nice|3|Red Stripe is really nice but extremely noisy. Very hard to have a conversation with all the background noise. However, I requested a quiet table on my OpenTable reservation and the manager did everything he could to accommodate us which was very much appreciated. Another drawback is the tables are VERY close together which makes you feel as though you are dining with the couple next to you. It's a bit awkward.
January 13, 2013|First visit and a great choice!|5|Recently had lunch in a party of 8 ( 3 of which were kids) at Red Stripe. Picked it from Yelp reviews. High flavor and perfect portions. All 8 lunch choices were awesome! Service was attentive but not overwhelming. Seating was a little cramped with all of us at a single table in the center but we will be back!
January 11, 2013|This is a charming, bustling|4|This is a charming, bustling bistro! The mussels are wonderful, which has prevented me from trying more of the menu! The warm delightful bread is delivered by a bread server, a slice at a time. Delicious! There's a painting of an old factory near the front of the room; it's great, and gives homage to the area's roots. (I'd like to know the painter's name!)
January 6, 2013|Red Stripe is one of my favorites|5|Red Stripe is one of my favorites - the food is good; the service is warm, the ambience is great for a fun night out!
January 1, 2013|The hostess/manager could|1|The hostess/manager could not have been ruder. We were using the last part of a $100 gift card that probably had @$25 left on it. When i gave it to the waiter with my CC he came back and said there was nothing on the card. I said that couldn't be, as we had only had two small lunches on it prior. I asked if there was a record and mgr provided it, and it was clearly incorrect. It has us eating TWICE in one day, different $ amounts. Both her/waiter said there were problems w/the system. The host/mgr told us to pound sand...tough luck. We are respectable people, the last thing we were trying to do was beat Red Stripe out of $25. The hostess basically implied it was our problem and get lost. I will NEVER dine at RS or Mills Tavern AGAIN.
December 31, 2012|The Mussels and Little necks|4|The Mussels and Little necks are worth alone for coming back!!!! Next time this will be my meal even though its listed under the Appertizers.
December 30, 2012|Try the invisible purees!|1|Appetizers and salads were incredible. 3 out of 5 entrees were sent back. Toast & bacon on BLT were horribly, horribly burnt, no avocado mayo was on it, and no tomato jam- only 2 little chunks of tomato. Lavender chicken was dry and tough. Scallops were perfectly cooked on shrimp and scallops, but shrimp was horribly overcooked, & tougher than the lavender chicken. Manager (beard, flannel shirt) was totally rude/condescending. He explained that I couldn't see the avocado mayo & tomato jam because they were pureed, as if that would make them invisible. He also looked at the chicken from across the table, and made sure we knew that it looked fine to him. He never apologized, and was reluctant to swap out meals or make other arrangements.
December 27, 2012|Red stripe is our go to dinner|4|"Red stripe is our go to dinner spot whenever we have out -of -town guests. Interesting menu without being too ""chef-y"", great location (who doesn't like to show off the East Side?) and enough atmosphere to make you feel mildly cool and ""with -it "". Our friends from NC enjoyed the calamari and seafood offerings and were intrigued by the shepherd's pie (made with duck - a bit rich but worth sharing). Noise level makes intimate dinner conversation difficult but the insanely large portions take away the need for talking."
December 26, 2012|Wait time between being seated|4|Wait time between being seated and getting a beverage was 15 mins. Wait time was about 50 mins between ordering lunch and receiving it. Thankfully I had soup with my sandwich, so getting a second drink was a priority I could forego, rather than keep trying to flag the waitress. Food was excellent though.
December 23, 2012|A great find|5|Out of town visitors, we saw the name on an advertisement and read a review on line. The brunch did not disappoint us. Creative menu (bread pudding french toast, lox and eggs, bbq pork hash, etc), good portions, great tastes, outstanding service - a real find. So good, we went back for dinner with our friends. No wonder the place is recognized as a neighborhood favorite. I would highly recommend the Red Stripe to everyone.
December 22, 2012|Be back soon, !!|5|Two knock-out meals, tuna with a twist. The evening special. Filet with shiitake, and pumpkin ravioli. Can't beat the prices either

December 7, 2012|Wonderful choice for dinner|5|Wonderful choice for dinner with a few friends. We are Foodies who are usually not totally and unanimously pleased with our dinners, but this time was the exception. We all ordered different selections and no one had anything but extravagant praise for both the food and the service. It helped that we had a window table, otherwise it would have been too noisy for me. The price was very reasonable. This is a gem!
December 4, 2012|I had been to Red Stripe a|3|I had been to Red Stripe a few times and always had an excellent meal. This time I brought a friend who had never been there. I had the Portuguese seafood stew which was excellent with a nice flavorful and slightly spicy broth. My friend ordered the Paella which was disappointing. They rice was dry so she took some broth from my stew to put over it which improved it. I would go back, but wouldn't order paella there.
December 1, 2012|After anticipating this evening|2|After anticipating this evening for the week, I was quite disappointed with my meal here. We ordered one drink for my wife, a Cosmo. She said it was very good. However, our soups were a tale of two different stories. My wife's tomato soup was hot, my clam chowder was lukewarm. The bread that the waiter told us was a little late in arriving (due to it needing to be warmed) was not all that warm. Moving to the dinner, once again...my wife's paella was hot, my steak was lukewarm. My frites were very, very salty, too. We did not order dessert. Waitstaff was pleasant, attentive and a strong positive for the evening. Surroundings were lovely. Restaurant was easily found. I would probably give this joint another shot...but I'm

November 9, 2012|Fancy but not pricy|5|Their dinner menu is outstanding and the food is as presentable as it is delicious. It is also a great place for brunch, right in Wayland Square in Providence.
November 9, 2012|Lunch at Red Stripe|4|"The salmon was excellent - cooked just right and with crisp, light vegetable ribbons that complemented the fish perfectly. We were both very pleased with our meal. Dessert was good, too, although I'd like to see some lighter choices on the menu. The location for this ""active gem"" in Wayland Square is wonderful. I liked the ease of making a reservation online through OpenTable and was glad my friend and I chose Red Stripe as an occasion to catch up on our lives. The one drawback was the high noise level. I like good conversation when I have lunch with friends so I'd recommend going early or later to avoid the busiest time of the meal. Overall, this is fine dining in a lovely neighborhood."

A couple of people in our party tried 2 different styles of the moules and frites - both were delicious. Will definitely return!
November 4, 2012|I have eaten here three times|5|"I have eaten here three times - twice for lunch and once for brunch. Although brunch was excellent, lunch was the truly outstanding meal. The Red Stripe Grilled Cheese Sandwich, made with thick white bread and gruyere cheese, garnished with pear, prosciutto, and basil, would earn an ""outstanding"" rating from me no matter what else was on the menu, the rest of the dishes we tried were excellent as well. While the grilled pizza is not quite as good as Al Forno's in my opinion, my daughter liked it better. The roasted tomato soup was just the thing for a cold and rainy day. I imagine the place can get busy at night, but there were open tables at all three of our meals (two on Saturday and one on Sunday)."
November 3, 2012|A new favorite!|5|We could not make up our minds and enjoyed very bit of this experience. We started with the mussles/frites Marineire, entres of tuna, fishermen's stew and shirp/scallops then ended with the molten chocolate cake. We will be back sooner than later!

And the noise level is too too much... If your'e looking for a nice quiet restaurant, this is NOT the place.
October 28, 2012|Ok food but fair experience|2|A bit of a disappointment. Food was adequate but I got very little fish with my fish and chips. My wife got the short ribs which were excellent. My biggest negative was the hostess who seated us and then, with many open tables seated a couple right next to us. There was about 18 inches of space between us and our nice quiet dinner was spoiled. I might go back but this isn't going on my regular rotation.

September 27, 2012|Red Stripe is a good local|3|Red Stripe is a good local restaurant and is always busy. On this occasion I requested a quiet table near the back as it was my birthday. The restaurant honored this request and the evening was very pleasant. I was a little disappointed with the food on this occasion. I had the roasted tomato soup which was nice but not hot. My husband enjoyed his french onion soup. I then had the duck confit with risotto. The duck part was tasty but the risotto was very bland and tasted watery. It just wasn't up to par. My husband's steak frites was good and tasty as it always is- my usual go-to menu item- but the steak was unevenly cooked. An issue of quality control perhaps.
September 22, 2012|I'm not sure...|3|So this is a tough review. It was a party of 4, including a 10 year old, and the atmosphere, service and overall great mix of people (including a lot of families with kids) made this a home run. And the food, which was varied in terms of selection, was great at the time. What makes it tough is that I had a stomach issue after dinner. I thought it might just be me, but it turned out to also be with another member of the party. And a third person had acid reflux all night and hasn't for years. So, it could be us. But I'm a VIP Open Table person and eat out multiple times a week. So, it could be them. I want to go back, and I want to tell you to go, but I'm a little uncertain...

September 15, 2012|Great ighgt in fun college town|5|Think fabulous French bistro. Think Providence, RI, so ridiculously gigantic portions. Think high energy and lots of enthusiasm. I think you've got Red Stripe. Terrific waiter brought us Grecques moules et frites - lots of fennel and slabs of hot,crusty sour dough bread - while we sipped a white MacMurray white wine (his suggestion) & looked at menu. Two meaty crabcakes and the beet salad won the appetizer awards - skip the sweet potato latkes. Halibut won the dinner prize with salmon as runner up. Chicken was a distant third - over cooked. Traditionl brownie sundae for dessert was plentyy for three. Great night in fun college town.
September 10, 2012|My wife and I truly enjoyed|4|My wife and I truly enjoyed our dinner at Red Stripe. Everything from start to finish was spot on. Excellent mussels for our apps was just what it should have been. Clean, bright flavors of garlic and fennel was the perfect match for the wine suggested by our server, Stephanie. The duck confit was a big hit. The cider brined pork was perfectly prepared. Charred outer crust and moist inside. My only problem with the menu was that I had a difficult time choosing what to order. When presented with a menu so diverse in selections I was torn between several items. That only leaves me with the decision to return to Red Stripe and try the Braised Short Ribs and some different mussel dishes.
September 8, 2012|This was a wonderful neighborhood|4|This was a wonderful neighborhood restaurant in a pretty area of Providence. The bread was amazing and we don't usually even bother with the bread - don't skip it. Portions were generous and the mussels were delicious. It was definitely a noisy restaurant, so don't expect a romantic dinner, but we went with friends and found it to be perfect. The service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and friendly without being overbaring.
September 4, 2012|Good lunch spot Get the mussels|3|Usually go here once a month or so always have the mussels which are always good. The smoked salmon plate plate was not as good as it used to be. Foods seems to be slipping a little. Grilled cheese and tomato soup also not it's usual loveliness. The margarita pizza and croque madam were both wonderful as was the service.
September 2, 2012|As always, the food and service|4|As always, the food and service were great. Love that we can walk there. Great neighborhood restaurant.
September 1, 2012|The room was very lively,|4|"The room was very lively, and the streets too! (Waterfire Saturday) Excellent Calamari, with spicy fried peppers, perfect portion size. My wife's short rib was buttery tender, but the braising liquid/sauce really had no depth of flavor, so the meat was a little flat. My steak fritte was delicious, but the meat was quite rare (cold center) and not rested, so it was a little chewy. The fries were excellent, almost addictive. We were going to have the cheese platter, but our server steered us away (around the corner to Farmstead). A great Australian Shiraz/Viognier blend was our wine choice called ""Chook"" We will be back."
September 1, 2012|One of my favorite restaurants|4|One of my favorite restaurants in Providence. Food is always delicious and the atmosphere is always lively. In the warmer months, the floor to ceiling windows open for an al fresco dining ambiance. Excellent cocktails as well. I certainly recommend this spot if you are on the east side!
August 31, 2012|Decent food in busy restaurant|3|Decent food in busy restaurant so reservation needed. Always noisy but that doesn't bother me as it drowns out the sound of other diners' conversations (Americans have very loud voices even when dining out!). Food quality is consistent. Wide menu choice which is helpful Salad dressing was a bit thick and glaggy and house salad was a bit dull. I would prefer a bread basket left on the table with a selection of breads as don't really care for sourdough. Would also like the option of olive oil as don't like unsalted butter very much. Fries were very good with the steak frites, but the steak was unevenly cooked and was only medium as per order at one end. Nice cocktails. A drinks list on the table with beers etc would be helpful.
August 31, 2012|Mussels Greque fennel overpowered|3|Mussels Greque fennel overpowered by coriander. Margharita pizza too heavily loaded with cheese...definitely needed the sharp steak knives to cut as crust was very crisp.
August 30, 2012|Very nice|4|One of the best hamburger I have ever had, very nice service, highly recommended
August 24, 2012|CACOPHONOUS Cuisine|2|"Great food and service, but VERY NOISY. It is difficult to carry on a conversation at your table when the place is full of people. The trend to design places to be ""energetic"" is unfortunate. Maybe I'm out of date, but I like to have a conversation when dining out that doesn't require shouting."
August 24, 2012|Portuguese Fisherman's stew.|5|Portuguese Fisherman's stew. Don't ask questions, just order it! Steak Frites also great, and believe it not, the cheapest thing on the dinner menu - the meatloaf ($12)- is OFF THE CHARTS! The beer list is so-so, but that's the only downside, and certainly not enough to reduce my esteem for the fabulous food, staff, and scene.
August 24, 2012|We had steak frites and burgers|3|We had steak frites and burgers which were not bad or great but okay. The French onion soup was not good--too sweet and crouton tasted sour. The restaurant is very noisy so a bit hard to hear each other, but it was a lively and fun atmosphere. Our waiter was very good. Would go again to see if anything else is more tasty.

August 18, 2012|Red Stripe is a great place|4|Red Stripe is a great place to get a fancy meal at very reasonable prices. A true bistro with all sorts of comfort food, but also some higher end dishes. For instance, I had a duo of duck confit with a mushroom risotto that was delicious while my wife had a duck confit shepards pie. We have also been here for lunch with our kids and they have a great kids selection. Not a fancy date place, but a solid joint if you want energetic ambiance and a great meal.

Dined on July 27, 2012|Noisy but yummy|3|So noisy we could not hear ourselves think! My guest wasn't prepared for that level of noise - can't something be done about it? Otherwise, it's a great place, great food, and we love the mussels - but I can't go back with someone I hope to talk to in the evening because of this level of hubbub. Our waiters couldn't hear us and we couldn't hear them either! Too bad...
July 23, 2012|Neighboorhood Treasure|4|The Red Stripe is a cozy place with incredible staff and delicious food. I had the Mouclade Mussells as recommended by the waitress. They were INCREDIBLE. My partner ordered the Steak Frites and was very happy with the meal. Cooked to perfection. We took our 9 month old daughter who fit in just fine. What a great night out!
July 22, 2012|Always Great!|4|Red Stripe is always a great spot for a bistro food and drink. We eat there often.
July 21, 2012|Very good dinner. Ed did a|4|Very good dinner. Ed did a great job meeting our needs. Our only complaint was that it has poor acoustics. Very noisy for the number of people present. I would still recommend it. Reasonably priced for the quality of the food.
July 21, 2012|Alone time — but, not alone|4|We have 2 small children & when we go to Red Stripe we feel like we're on a date, even with the kids. Great food, vibrant ambiance, good service. Always look forward to returning.

July 13, 2012|Delicious but noisy. Great Food!|4|We love Red Stripe. The Moules Frites is some of the best we have found. The grilled cheese is also spectacular. But, do remember that it is very busy and thus very noisy so do not go expecting a romantic dinner. It is best to go in the early evening or for lunch as it is a bit quieter at that time.
July 12, 2012|The food is good however,|4|The food is good however, the noise level was very high and made it difficult to have a discussion. Also we were seated by the kitchen and had a lot of traffic walking by. I live around the corner so it was convenient to walk over for dinner.

Had the Curry Chicken Salad. It is light, not spicy, and tastes great with the added walnuts. Relaxing place for lunch and quiet discussion.

July 3, 2012|Midnight in Providence|5|Our wedding anniversary dinner could not be beat. Right from the start, our requests were made. I had asked for a seat by the window and the hostess gave us two choices, one which wasn't set up- but a nice quiet corner. My husband chose the latter. We were greeted almost immediately by our server, Aaron. He was by far, one of the best waiters we've had dining in the Providence Metro area. Attentive, without being obtrusive- he was sure to check on our drinks, one of which, unbenounced to me, was taken prematurally. Identifying the slight error, Aaron brought over yet another bottle of preseco! Our meals were delicious- I had the grilled salmon with greens while my husband had the rib eye, cooked a perfect medium rare. Creme brûlée & capp.

June 23, 2012|Liked it but rushed|4|The service was very rushed. Our server came multiple times asking to take the apps/entrees when we clearly weren't finished. People were literally mid-bite. That was disappointing, especially since we'd come with friends we don't see much and wanted to enjoy some time together. The fries were also cold. Maybe they'd been cooked a lot earlier then reheated? We did like the menu but with so many restaurant options in Providence, we'll probably go somewhere else next time.

The signature grilled cheese was a hit, and the lavender chicken was very well seasoned. It was quite loud at first, so it was difficult to carry a conversation across the table, but it calmed down later in the evening.

May 10, 2012|Really Nice Neighborhood Restaurant|4|Nice service, food was very fresh & good (not typical fare but homemade). My SIL's steak was delicious and the kids said their burgers were nice and juicy. My only mild reservation was that I had a lot of cherry tomatoes in my cobb salad, which seemed kind of fillerish to me. They were very nice with the children (2 adults w/6 young children). We got crayons for the tables which were made with cloth and a paper overlay. The hostess was fantastic, and a really nice touch was that they remembered who ordered what, which doesn't happen often these days when dining out. It was a bit noisy but some like that for atmosphere. Local sourced food would be even better. But, I would definitely return, it is a really nice neighborhood restaurant.
May 4, 2012|Fantastic food and service.|4|Fantastic food and service. We visit often but they really need to address the acoustics in here it can be extremely noisy.

Dined on April 14, 2012|We'll go back... we always do.|4|We've been to Red Stripe many times. Their martinis are great... we almost always love the food... This was one of those times when we didn't order the best selections. I ordered the 'special' spinach salad which had way too much dressing... just soaked in oil.. the steak 'add-on' was cooked to perfection, medium rare. My husband ordered the Caesar salad... the romaine was more like hearts of romaine, barely any color or flavor to it. He did enjoy the crab cakes... So, next time, we'll skip the salads... The bread... always sinfully delicious.

Flavors did not disappoint...all ingredients were so fresh and flavors blended beautifully. Should be added to regular menu! Entrees also were very appealing to the eye when presented. Pork entree with sweet potato hash, roasted asparagus, and homemade applesauce very nice blend of flavors. Linguine & clams also beautifully presented and just the right portion. Thank you for an outstanding evening...can't wait to return.

The cocktails were outstanding, the Eiffel Tower is becoming a favorite. Great place to bring kids--it's a pretty noisy restaurant, you don't even realize there are many kids there until they walk by you as they leave. Fun atmosphere, always great food. Our entire party of 6 had a wonderful night out.
April 7, 2012|Our table was not ready for|3|"Our table was not ready for the 1:00 reservation-despite calling ahead the morning of (in addition to the online reservation). During the phone call we were told, ""You're table will be ready when you get here."" Nope. We waited a good 10-15 minutes. The waitress was excellent, but the service was really slow (I think there must have been problems in the kitchen). The food was very good (a little salty, though). Excellent fries!!!!! This is a really noisy restaurant-not great for conversation. Great location and overall a good experience."
April 6, 2012|21st birthday dinner for 6|4|21st birthday dinner for 6 was a hit. The great menu options and hearty food pleased all. Our server was terrific and attentive. The noise level on a Friday night is very high but she managed to anticipate or hear our every need! Short ribs were terrific. BLT is the best. Salads look good but too many other tempting choices cause one to wander from salads. A really good find for good valued food @ hot spot!
April 5, 2012|Mussels and frites|3|Nice little spot to get lunch or dinner. It isn't the type of place you go for a romantic meal. Vibrant bar scene on the weekends.. Food is good although portions are smaller than most restaurants in the area for the prices. Mussells are a good way to go. Wish they had a little bit more of a seafood option.
March 31, 2012|prompt and polite|4|good dinner (crab cakes to start, I had fish and chips, she had a fish dish too), second drink was weak and not as tasty as a result (Nor'easter with goslings, ginger beer and pineapple so too little rum gave a bitter pineapple soda) but the waitress so excellent and the hostess showed us to a nice table in the very crowded restaurant with a delay.
March 31, 2012|Providence - On the left bank.|4|"Overall a very satisfying experience. French bistro food in a bistro styled atmosphere. Attention to service obvious. As per Michelin ""Worth a detour !"""

March 25, 2012|Too noisy for conversation|4|We went to spend an evening with friends. The food and service were great (though there was a vegetarian among us, and he could only find ziti with marinara sauce to eat. He was really disappointed). We love to talk, but frankly, we could hardly hear each other without yelling. In future I would request a booth in hopes it would be quieter.
March 10, 2012|This is the fifth time I have|3|This is the fifth time I have been to Red Stripe and the food was great once we were served. The food took forever, and the service was lacking. The waiter took our drink order and forgot to bring the drinks. Once reminded he asked as if the bar was backed up and proceeded to bring back two of the wrong drinks. He was nice, but slow.

March 6, 2012|The food was overly salted.|1|The food was overly salted. I've wanted to like this place because there are few places in Providence to go for a decent sit-down lunch, but it's the third time I've been to Red Strip and each time it's been off the mark. It's popular, but in my opinion, it's mediocre. Ambiance isn't bad, but food is consistently disappointing.
March 3, 2012|Not only was our food great,|5|Not only was our food great, as always, and the service good, but what impressed me was how our waitress went out of her way to insure my cocktail was mixed to my satisfaction. In my experience, this is a part of the dining experience that many places treat too lightly
March 3, 2012|Great neighborhood bistro!|4|We visit often. Great neighborhood bistro! Beef short rib and Red Devil Pasta are over the top!
February 29, 2012|Don't let the name fool you|4|The name is misleading. I had written the place off previously as a boozy Jamaican joint - based only on the name. After a little reserach and inquiries with a few trusted friends, I foundgreat food in a lively atmosphere. I brought a work guest and was afraid that it might be too loud, but we got a table ina window alcome and were delighted. Our server disappeared for a bitin the middle of the mael, but we were otherwise delighted.
February 26, 2012|Always a Great Visit|5|I have visited several times before with my family and we enjoy ourselves every time. I recommended that my friends and I go to Red Stripe for dinner and they enjoyed the food and environment. The frites are wonderful and certainly a staple of the restaurant's diverse menu. Highly recommend a visit, it will quickly become a favorite of yours.
February 26, 2012|The reviews we read about|3|The reviews we read about Red Stripe before our first visit last Sunday complained about the noise level and slow service. I can concur. The service as unbelievably SLOW and the restaurant wasn't full, so it was very strange. It was as if the wait staff knew about the reviews and were just living up to them. The noise was quite loud, loud enough that you could not have a conversation without yelling or repeating. Takes away from the experience. That said, the food was delicious and the ambiance is fun and very much like a european brasserie.

Good main dishes: the veal was cooked perfectly but the egg noodle bed was flavorless; the fish and chips were good but one quarter of the plate was inexplicably over-salted.

February 10, 2012|disappointed diner|2|Had a reservation and was seated immediately, service was very slow, we waited 45 minutes for our dinners to come which was not ideal with kids, food was ok, not great, used to be better. Red stripe is so convenient and nice to see all the locals, but continually disappoints with how long it takes to get food and the quality of food. I feel it was better a few years ago.
February 8, 2012|Good Food, Lively Atmosphere|4|I ordered the duck confit/roulade and it was delicious. My husband had the short ribs - which are now prepared differently than several months ago. The rib pieces are smaller and very nicely browned and the overall texture is much better. I would highly recommend the short ribs now.

From the moment we walked in until we left we felt that the service was on the mark. The staff/servers were quick but not 'hurried' and the food was was excellent. Thank you Providence Restaurant Week for helping us find a true Providence Gem!

He was friendly, and well mannered, making sure to check in on us at appropriate times. The Steak Frites were cooked cooked to perfection. Juicy and tender with perfectly fried fries. The wine special was also very nice, and everything is affordable. I can't wait to go back again and try out some new flavors.
January 12, 2012|Fun but with setbacks.|4|Red Stripe always provides a great dining atmosphere with tasty concoctions from the kitchen! The only negative for me is that the tables are way too close together and sometimes you feel like you're in other people's conversations or you can't hear your own thoughts at times.

December 30, 2011|Found Red Stripe via web search|5|Found Red Stripe via web search for upscale, kid-friendly restaurants. Red Stripe came highly recommended and did not disappoint. Food was fantastic and the place was crawling w/ kids so we didn't feel like outcasts w/ a 1 and a 7 year old. Will be back many times w/ and w/o kids.
December 5, 2011|Will definitely be coming back!|5|I went here with a co-worker when we were traveling on business. She ordered the Paella and I had the Duck Confit Shepard's Pie. We are both fairly small girls and practically polished off our dinners because they were both so delicious! The Duck Confit Shepard's Pie was rich and hearty, but not overly so. It was different than anything I've eaten before and think I would have a hard time NOT ordering that again the next time I go to Red Stripe...and given that we constantly do business in Providence, I'll definitely be back. I read some bad reviews online and didn't have any of the same experiences. Wine, entrees and dessert were all delicious and our waiter was totally adorable and friendly.
December 4, 2011|Not worth it|2|A beautiful space. The service was another thing altogether. The waitress came to our table and asked if we wanted drinks. I said I'd like coffee and my husband wanted one as well. She left the table without even looking at the other people at the table. She was not very attentive. The food was disappointing. Someone ordered lobster benedict and the lobster was dry and rubbery. It took a long time to find the waitress at this point. Someone had to leave the table to find her. She came over to the table a few minutes later and asked if they wanted a whole new plate of food or just more lobster. They should have a policy to deal with such things. I have been there before and it was great but the quality and service have gone downhill.
December 3, 2011|We have eaten at Red Stripe|5|"We have eaten at Red Stripe multiple times and always have a memorable meal/evening. Last Saturday, we drove up from South County, having asked friends from Boston and Tiverton to meet us there. We thought it was a great ""central"" meeting point. Everyone left happy and sated."
