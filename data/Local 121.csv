February 21, 2016|Spectacular Dining Experience 5 Stars!|5|Our server Cat was wonderful, she was very patient and gracious with us. Gave outstanding service. The menu was small but everything seemed super amazing, made it difficult to choose. The Flat Iron Steak was Delicious, the poached lobster was succulent, both a must! One of the guest at the table wasn't keen on entree of choice. Cat insisted on finding something that would make them happy. A new entree was sent out quickly, it was great how understanding and accommodating the restaurant was. I really enjoyed my time, the round booth was cozy and intimate. For dessert we got the creme brulee and the s'mores ice cream concoction. I will be coming back on my next visit to Rhode Island, thank you for making the evening memorable. Every bite was better than the next, a gem of a place.
February 19, 2016|Sam|5|Well thought out menu great value and look forward to going back

February 14, 2016|Sadly dissapointed|2|"Was really looking forward to trying out this local spot, featuring local ingredients. Unfortunately, not sure if they were caught off guard w/ Valentines Day brunch, but all was just ""ok"", which is not what I had hoped for. Service slow though personable (after they finally came over), and the food was fair at best. I take that back... the sticky bun was very good. I think the real kicker was my eggs benedict was sent out with massively overcooked bacon strips substituted, rather than the classic Canadian bacon (as obviously listed on the menu). If the server had apologized and stated that they had run out of the Canadian bacon (must have been the reason), I would have been ABSOLUTELY fine with it. But trying to sneak it under the radar... nope. Doesn't work. So... pretty sure I won't be returning, as just the sticky bun was good, but not good enough to warrant another try."
February 13, 2016|Terrific vibe|4|The restaurant has a great vibe and feeling for a date (I went there on Valentines Day with my wife of 35 years). We had a great time. My only complaint (and this was probably partly our fault for ordering it) was that the amount of food for a $65.00 meal for two left something to be desired. The steak though was delicious.
February 13, 2016|I had the best dessert in my entire life...|5|I had the best dessert in my entire life at 121! Always a great meal, and I always choose 121 to bring out of town guests.
February 13, 2016|Great Food. Amazing Service|5|Our dinner was amazing. The service was excellent and the food was beyond spectacular. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a dinner for a special occasion or any other romantic dinner. The complimentary valet is also great so you aren't stuck looking for a parking spot
February 6, 2016|Loved the local sourcing. All the meals ...|5|Loved the local sourcing. All the meals were interesting and delicious.
February 6, 2016|Slow uninterested  server. Crazy loud bar.|2|The server was very slow and I'm interested in making a pleasurable evening for us. We had to move because the patrons next to us were so rowdy. It took forever to get our food it took forever to get our drinks. Food was on remarkable. More smiles were definitely needed from your help.
February 5, 2016|Fine downtown dining|5|Local 121 is a favored spot for us to have a pre-Trinity theater dinner. The menu and the bar menu are inventive, the food and drinks beautifully prepared and presented. The tables are large and well spaced, so we have never felt crowded in. The service is prompt, courteous, and unobtrusive. Not only would I, but I have recommended it to several friends. A+++
February 5, 2016|Delish|5|Local food, expert preparation, nice ambiance. Love the rabbit!
February 4, 2016|Better than ever|4|Local 121 was good when it opened although somewhat uneven. Then quality and consistency declined a bit. But now, it is better than ever -- up there with Providence’s best restaurants. I could order almost everything on the menu. Cost can be kept down with small plates. Cocktail list is creative. Desserts are terrific.
January 22, 2016|We love coming to Local 12|5|We love coming to Local 12
January 21, 2016|Blown away by food, decor and service|5|Wow! What a gem! This place looks very normal from the outside but inside, you are taken back into time. When you walk in, you can either head downstairs to the relaxed atmosphere of a casual bar or head into the main dining where you find a beautifully decorated space or the the throwback feel of a speakeasy bar. Our waitress, Cat, took such great care of us. We were there for restaurant week but also ordered full appetizers and drinks. What I loved about the menu was their selection of locally sourced ingredients. They did such a wonderful job describing, preparing and serving each dish. I LOVED their calamari! I will most definitely be back!
January 17, 2016|Great food, spotty service|4|"We will be returning to Local 121, which we tried during Providence's Restaurant Week. The short rib was superb. The Pollock was fine, though, frankly, New England whitefish is New England whitefish, whatever the rhetorical flourishes on the menu. Wine selection good for us. We loved the decor. The chairs are very comfortable. The bar looks great! Service was spotty. Our wait person excused her tardiness because it was a ""busy night"", but the glass of wine was delivered at the end of the meal, without apology. Oops. We're willing to try again - it's that good."
January 16, 2016|Excellent for a date!|5|My date and I had a wonderful time at Local 121. The food was excellent; so was the service. The ambiance was well suited to a date. I would go again!
January 10, 2016|Great potential, but terrible menu|3|This is the second time in a few yrs here. The menu is very short. They give you 3 flimsy and small pieces of bacon for a bacon side in an attempt to appear gourmet. The decor and ambience are what I love about this place, and the service was great, but the menu choices were very limited and the food was quite mediocre. I am afraid without a major revamp this place is close to bankruptcy.
January 9, 2016|Ahhhh. Gracious and not too loud.|5|We needed this upbeat but sophisticated restaurant after several days of good food but frantic loud and chaotic ones. Husband had their foie and beet salad and a smoked scallop - all appetizers of generous size. I went with the tempura batter fish on grains which was light but plenty hearty. Would return.
January 2, 2016|Good Food, Average Prices|3|The small plates were reasonably priced and relatively filling, to the point we almost split an entree. Luckily we did not, as they were both relatively small. Elegantly plated and expertly cooked, but small and $28-35. Service was relatively slow. For a Saturday night they only had what appeared to be one server in our section of several tables. Could have used a second server to speed things along.
January 2, 2016|The duck was spectacular. My cousin had ...|5|The duck was spectacular. My cousin had the ribeye and that was cooked superbly as well. Always be prepared for a 2 plus hour dining experience at a place like this. Also the dining room is intimate so be prepared to hear the conversation of the table next to you.
December 31, 2015|Easily one of the best meals of my life.|5|Not only was the food expertly prepared, the chef's wine pairings were so incredibly spot on that it enhanced every single bite. I cannot wait to go back.
December 26, 2015|Hit or miss Food|3|Four of us ate dinner; two of us enjoyed our meal, but two of us did not. The lobster was definitely overcooked and rubbery. It came in a red wine sauce of some kind, which really did not taste good or go well with the lobster. The rabbit was fair at best. A good desert selection we tried three and enjoyed them all.
December 17, 2015|Surprised and Impressed|4|Every time I visit Local 121 the selections on the menu always entice me to try something I never tried before. Lately, it is beer battered scrod with bok choy and quinoa. The oysters were wonderful with the cranberry tang vinaigrette. Kudos to the chef, the kitchen staff, management and especially the bartenders.
December 12, 2015|Interesting tasteful fare|4|The menu is bit limited but had several items I would have ordered. All at my table were thrilled with their food. Flavors were noteworthy and decor unique. I heartily recommend this restaurant.
December 12, 2015|Outstanding service, fantastic food!|5|We loved our visit to Local 121. The food was outstanding and the service was superb. My only feedback to to get rid of or at least turn down the music
December 5, 2015|Great Ambiance|5|We enjoyed our dining experience. We would love to go again for sure.

November 14, 2015|Love Local 121|5|We're from Boston but often visit Local 121 when we're in town. Every single thing about our dinner last weekend was great: relaxed, friendly and highly competent service, wonderful menu selections, a very reasonable wine list. Everything was beautifully prepared and we're never rushed. Highly recommend.
November 12, 2015|Food is quite good and we had good servi...|4|Food is quite good and we had good service. We have been there twice and it is very noisy. Hard to enjoy the meal when you are shouting to be heard.
November 8, 2015|Ok so the Calamari was great tasting.  O...|2|Ok so the Calamari was great tasting. Our dinners was just ok. FYI. The beet steak dish is vegan. Not sure why they used the steak word. The Agnolotti Dish maybe had 5 pieces that was ok I guess. The beet steak was over priced. Not sure if we will return for dinner. Very Small Menu.
November 8, 2015|Enjoyable respite!|4|After several attempts to find a restaurant in Providence that served Brunch I thought of Local 121 and was not disappointed. The restaurant is a perfect setting, wasn't overly crowded but a nice turnover while we were there. The Bruch is not buffet style which I prefer otherwise you eat more than you should. the portions were adequate, the Boody Mary's were very spicy (which I love) and the service very good. Parking is somewhat of a problem even on a Sunday but we were lucky. It is a perfect downtown restaurant in close proximity to PPAC, Convention Center and Civic Center. Highly recommend.
November 6, 2015|Nice evening|4|I have been to Local 121 several times and enjoy it. This time I found that the menu was too limited and I had a hard time deciding what to have. There seems to be more small plates and less dinner options. That said, it was very good. My only complaint was that the green salad lacked flavor- not enough dressing. I can't remember the servers name but she was terrific.
November 4, 2015|Did not disappoint!!|5|We have been to Local 121 several times, for lunch, brunch, and dinner. We have never found it to be lacking. And this time was no different. Our server, Kayla (who has served us in the past) was impeccable in her attentiveness, her appropriate friendliness, and her professionalism. The food was superlative. We had two vegetarian options and loved them. I particularly enjoyed the Beet Steak over Quinoa. Yum. Highly recommend this wonderful place.
October 27, 2015|All the dishes were quite good and servi...|4|All the dishes were quite good and service was attentive. Very good experience. Would highly recommend.
October 18, 2015|Return to Good Form|4|I always love the menu at Local 121, but the execution has been uneven the last year or two. I just read that the executive chef is back after a brief absence and our meal last week was excellent.
October 16, 2015|Good Food, Tries Hard, but Inadequate Execution|3|"The food was pretty good overall, and the server was friendly. However, the friendliness masked a slowness in service (waiting for all the appetizers to appear, for instance, as a dish or two were missing. Also, trying to pay was an exercise in watching a snail crawl by). Had to wait in the rather grungy bar area as our table was occupied when we showed up. It is not a crime to have folks linger, but they really ought to have a better waiting area. Also, the valet parking had ""an accident"" so was unavailable when we arrived at 7:30, but by the end of the evening, magically popped up. Not very helpful. With other good restaurants in Providence, no need to come here."
October 9, 2015|Review|5|I've never tasted fries like that in my life. I'm a foodie, and when you are expecting the typical fry, it's exciting when a restaurant is able to give you a completely different texture, taste and perspective on food.
September 26, 2015|Food good! Table and Service not so good.|3|Good food, though I did find a clamshell-- or the shell of some bivalve-- in my clam chowder. Nice, food, though, overall-- two of us got multiple small plates as our entire meal and it was lovely. On the downside, we were placed very near the door and next to the hostess' station, despite having a reservation. Maybe that shouldn't matter? At any rate, the location of that table was less than ideal-- it didn't feel especially private or quiet, and it was distracting. That said it was incredibly busy that night, with WaterFire and other events going on. Not a dealbreaker. The service was very slow-- I don't know if it was the peak of business or if it's always paced that way, but we gave ourselves a two-hour window for dinner thinking we'd use a bit over an hour and in fact it took the better part of two hours to get three people fed. So go with no deadline, or, again, maybe we just had slow service that night.
September 26, 2015|Fine Dining, Reasonable Price|5|Local 121 is a small, intimate restaurant with excellent service and an inventive menu. It also has an excellent and reasonably priced 3 course prix fixe pre-theater menu. Located just a block from Trinity Rep in Providence, it is a great choice for a special evening out.
Dined on September 22, 2015|Great dinner spot|5|The dinner menu is full of excellently crafted entrees and the appetizers are to die for. We were both amazed by the knowledge of our server and at how attentive she was. The wine list and cocktails were also great. We had a nice date night here. Definitely would recommend!
September 19, 2015|Wonderful field to fork dining!|4|"No one should go here expecting a ""quick"" meal but the food is well worth the wait and the service is solid!"
September 17, 2015|A wonderful service and fantastic food.|5|A wonderful service and fantastic food.
September 5, 2015|Great find!|4|"Absolutely loved this restaurant! We immediately got a good vib upon entering the front door. The staff was friendly and attentive without rushing us at all. The decor was really ""cool"". The wine list was extensive and the food as well as the presentation of the food was great. I recommend this restaurant highly, what a pleasant surprise."
September 5, 2015|Nice simple Saturday brunch|5|Open for brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Simple but very tasty menu. Interesting cocktails. Very reasonably priced.

August 29, 2015|Lovely meal|5|This was a return visit for us; we had been to Local 121 a few years ago, so we anticipated another memorable dining experience. We were not disappointed. The food (two starters: trio of fresh tomatoes w/goat cheese, and a red leaf lettuce salad; two entrees: monkfish with collards; chicken with dandelion greens) was excellent, as were our drinks before dinner (the bellini was esp. nice). Overall a wonderful evening meal prior to setting out for a Waterfire experience. Would recommend this restaurant unreservedly...
August 28, 2015|Favorite Eatery|5|We are from the West Coast. Every time we are in Providence, usually once a year, we make a point of eating at Local 121. It is truly a gem. The food and presentation are outstanding. We are never disappointed regardless if we are eating in the dining room or bar. Make sure to check out Local 121 next time you are in Providence. You will be glad you did!!!
August 19, 2015|Excellent bistro in downtown Providence|5|We have been meaning to try Local 121 for quite a while & finally had a chance last week. We were so impressed & thoroughly satisfied with the fresh ingredients & succulent preparations. We had a beautiful heirloom tomato salad & fresh oysters to start, then 2 absolutely delicious entrees, the lobster ravioli (!) & the monkfish. They have a great wine list too, & make a killer martini. We loved it & will certainly be back!
August 16, 2015|Not very memorable. I'm sorry we tried i...|3|Not very memorable. I'm sorry we tried it on our last night in town. Interior decor is years past needing an update. Started in the ample cozy bar and should have just stayed there and eaten somewhere else.
August 14, 2015|local 121 - superb!|5|everything you'd hope for in a fine restaurant; great food and wine, thoughtfully stocked bar, very pleasant atmosphere, and from busboys to owners, relaxed, attentive, friendly folk abound.
August 7, 2015|four of us with diverse tastes all found...|4|four of us with diverse tastes all found meals we enjoyed. All fresh, local ingredients well-prepared. Our server was outstanding, not hovering,but always there-efficiently dealing with our needs (pre-show dinner, time constrained, one of us arriving late). Made it effortless for us and an enjoyable evening
July 26, 2015|Best calamari...Ever...5 of us agree. Al...|5|Best calamari...Ever...5 of us agree. All other meal items & beverages were delicious.
July 26, 2015|Gorgeous interior design. Great brunch.|5|Chairs are super comfortable. Quiet atmosphere. Limited menu, but great food. Went for brunch with my parents and was very happy. Would definitely go back.
July 12, 2015|Delicious Food very fresh!|5|Delicious Food very fresh!

July 11, 2015|Accommodating to special diet, amazing food!|5|Amazing! Would totally recommend to friends and will definitely be returning. We came for our anniversary and we were so impressed. I cannot eat soy or dairy as of recently and have not been able to eat out many places. The waitress and chef were so accommodating and I had the best meal I've had in a long time. Atmosphere was romantic! Drinks were top notch!
June 25, 2015|Great food and ambience!|4|We loved this place although the service was a little inconsistent. They tried hard but didn't quite know how to do it right. Still will go back!
June 20, 2015|It was ok|3|My wife and I went to Local 121 with another couple before seeing a show at PPAC. I had heard 121 was very good. I'm not saying it was bad, it just didn't wow me enough that I would go back. We had a great meal and the service was fine, but nothing that stuck in my head. I've been to many great restaruants in Providence that I have a lot of favorites. I would recommend trying it at least.
June 2, 2015|Love it|5|We go every time we are in Providence. Food is amazing, fresh, local. Awesome!
May 10, 2015|Fine for Frou Frou|3|"Stopped in at recommendation of hotel staff (Biltmore). Nice appearance, pleasant greeting, no waiting, great location. Lots of room among tables. Comfortable, clean, pretty. Loud people reading ""funny"" items from phone directly behind us. Local 121 can't really help that. Menu entirely odd. Brunch. But brunch from Chopped trying to show off eclectic and avant garde ingredients. I did enjoy my first slow egg. Fish and chips with slow egg. Chips equals two french fries. Two. my wife had a mushroom and cheese omelette with (shavings of?) asparagus. It was good. The fish was good. The breakfast sandwich with sausage and hollandaise was a table favorite. The Johnnycake was enormous, doughy, and left largely untouched. Perhaps one or two more familiar brunch items would have helped. Variations on the presentation of eggs (shirred?) with local sausage, local bread, interesting hash. Perhaps a local bakery could make a great bread for French toast with local butter local honey local syrup. If even ten percent of the menu were familiar we could have experimented with the new while being satisfied by the familiar. I will have to choose my dining companions carefully should I return. They have to be happy with high costs for interesting food and be ready to cross the street for a burger at a tavern if they want to feel satisfied after dinner. OUr brunch was 88 dollars for 4 before tip. Two of the four would not return."
May 10, 2015|Good but nothing special|4|We went for Mother's Day brunch. The menu was limited and one of the items in the web version of the menu. The food was good but was not inspired. The service was fair but not as attentive as it could have been. Maybe this is just a brunch issue. I will be back for dinner to see if things are different.
May 1, 2015|Unexpected trip to Providence & Local 121|4|Following a meeting in Newton we decided to stop in Wrentham at the outlets. From there it was a call to my daughter at Johnson & Wales to see if she was free for dinner on this Friday evening. We had Local 121 on our list of places to try in Providence and we were surprised to see Open Table said we could have a table for 3 at 6:00pm. Be sure to use valet parking unless you're always lucky finding a space. It wasn't busy when we walked in and it was full by the time we left. The decor was a nice surprise. Elegant, tastefully done with no sign of an electric candle anywhere. The food was varied and all delicious. I ordered carrots with bee pollen as a side just to see what they had done to it. Young carrots, cooked perfectly, with pollen sprinkled over was a delight. With 1 wine, 2 coffees, 1 Sprite, 3 entrées and 1 chocolate desert we had a very reasonable tab of $100. Plus a $20 tip and $6 for the valet it was a very enjoyable and worthwhile evening. We'll be back to try more from the menu.
April 25, 2015|We went here to celebrate our anniversar...|5|We went here to celebrate our anniversary (and I had made the restaurant aware of this) and we were treated to complimentary glasses of champagne, which was a very nice treat. I also appreciated the complimentary chef tasting of a spring soup. Everything we ate--from the scallops to the gnocchi to the chicken--was delectable. Service was attentive and it was a very special place to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Look forward to returning during a future trip to Providence!
April 11, 2015|Best in Providence|5|As if it were possible, this place has gotten even better since I was there last!! The food is so fresh and prepared meticulously. Everything is always delicious.
March 28, 2015|Great Farm to Table Dining|4|Were in Providence to see a game and found Local 121 on Open Table. As it was close to our parking, we gave it a try. Interior looks much larger than it is with mirror placement. Not so fancy that we felt out of place in jeans. Beer and wine menu is not huge, but has some excellent choices. Great Orval Trappist Ale on the beer menu. While $11 for a beer may seem high, it was a reasonable mark-up on a product that retails of $6. We were greeted with an amuse-bouche chilled soup shot, which was a nice starter. Calamari was cooked very nicely and Papaya, Cashews and Smoked Chili gave a different and complex flavor profile. The Braised Fava Rabbit was very tasty, but be prepared that it is served on the bone, which may be off-putting for some. Risotto Carbonara was also very nice. Lobster was slightly over-cooked, but the rissotto was done perfectly and it was overall a pleasing dish. Portions were decent sized and Olive Oil Sponge Cake was a nice finish for dessert.
March 28, 2015|Sunday Brunch w/o Tea Pig|4|"Local 121 offers a fun and exciting brunch menu: pretty non-standard fare compared to many other places around. Check it out if you're interested in trying something new for breakfast! Note: I ordered a ""Tea Pig,"" but what I got was just a tea pot. :( Addendum: Apparently my girlfriend informs me that a ""Tea Pig"" is a brand of tea bag. Here I was, expecting to be served tea in a pig-shaped pot or teacup. Welp."
March 18, 2015|Our server was fantastic. Extremely know...|4|Our server was fantastic. Extremely knowledgeable of the entire menu and helpful with wine pairings. The rabbit and risotto were perfect. Highly recommend!
March 7, 2015|Sweet space, excellent service, good food|4|"Everything great including truly excellent service except the food which I would say gets an A+ in concept but a B in preparation. Charcuterie board was lovely, but the scallop appetizer was dry and overlooked. The soup was tasty but bland. Having the burger in two thin patties ""cooked all the way through"" and smothered in too many onions robs one of the pleasure of appreciating the juicy flavor of grass fed beef - even though I got it medium rare. My kids loved their lobster tagliatelle. The ambiance and the service were truly excellent. Maybe the kitchen just had an off night."
March 7, 2015|Local gem|5|Local121 has been around for a while. I have been here several times and each time the menu is new and exciting. Because it is a locavore restaurateur, they rarely offer the exact set of choices. And everything I have tried there has been very good. The cheddar beer and potato soup was yummy. I had a quail dinner this time that worked very well. Valet parking is essential because it is so close to the Dunkin Donuts Center and the Trinity Rep Theater.
February 27, 2015|Great Find!|4|Great food, awesome mixed drinks! The servic was good but we felt they tried to get us in and out fast which was a little annoying, things came to quickly and the waitress seemed to pressure us to order quickly. She was friendly it was just strange the dining room wasn't packed or anything and people weren't waitong for tables. That being said I'd still go back it, overall a great place dine.
February 14, 2015|Romantic Valentines Dinner|5|Local 121 was very good overall. The service was excellent. It's a cute place with nice decor and ambiance, very cozy and quaint. We enjoyed our experience and the food was wonderful and creative.
February 13, 2015|Bait and switch|4|Although our overall first experience to Local 21 was very good; we were initially very disappointed to learn that they were only offerring a very limited Prix Fixe menu. Their website never mentioned a limited menu, so we had our hearts set on menu items that were not available, however, everything we did order off the limited menu was delicious!
February 1, 2015|a little gem|4|I made a reservation to the restaurant upon hearing great reviews from friends and yes, they were right--the dining experience here is unlike any other in Providence. The food was charmingly plated, delicious, and locally flavored. I would definitely come here again to try the rest of the brunch menu items. Portion sizes are plentiful and there's a lot of variety in the menu to balance out a savory and sweet meal for 2 (or more). Would definitely dine here again.
January 31, 2015|Cold fish|2|This restaurant came highly recommended. Three people ordered the salad as a starter. The greens were mostly good. The salad was perfectly dressed. The person who ordered the foie gras said it was good but not memorable. Two people had the monkfish with apples. The fish came on skewers interspersed with soggy apples. The menu led me to believe that the apples were en brochette, not the fish. Fish was room temp. Plate cold. It felt like I was served leftover fish fragments. Waitress was pretty but unschooled in table communication. The chairs were so big it was impossible to have diners at the rear of the table for 4 served. Plates were passed. Chairs are too big for the room and the table. Maitre d could not be found when we arrived and when we needed to leave. Overall disappointment, weak food, inadequate attention to detail. Good location. Would appreciate recommendations for restaurant in walking distance from trinity rep.
January 30, 2015|Great evening|5|"Our recent dinner at Local 121 was tasty and we had excellent service. We were meeting with friends we don't see often and were able to enjoy a long leisurely evening. The restaurant wasn't crowded (bad weather), but this worked in our favor since we were not being hurried out. On a previous evening, we were served cocktails and 3 courses in 59 minutes. Our efforts to just let the food sit while we digested the previous course were met with frantic ""is everything alright?"" pleas from the server. I'm glad we tried again and we'll know to avoid more busy times. All the food was excellent."
January 28, 2015|Dinner before a show|4|We dined here before we saw a concert. Most of the diners were also seeing the show so it was very busy. The food was very good and they kept us on time to get to our concert. Next time we would like to sit in one of the very cozy banquette seating. All in all a very nice experience.
January 23, 2015|Amazing first time|5|Though we had never been before, We were given a gift certificate for Christmas. Starting from the moment we pulled up to valet, the experience was amazing. Our server, Emily, was wonderful. The food and atmospheres perfect! We can't wait to go back.
January 10, 2015|another tremendous evening at local 121.|5|The food here is simply awesome. This is the best restaurant in PVD. Chef Tyler is a prodigy who can turn any dish into an extravaganza of tastes. Service was impeccable, as always (EMILY!), and we look forward to returning asap.
January 10, 2015|Delicious, tough steak|4|The service was great. The flavors were wonderful, but the steak itself was very tough and I think the knife was kind of dull. Possibly a combination of both.
Dined on December 23, 2014|Chef Tyler Demora is Fabulous.|5|"The food at Local 121 is fantastic. This is a credit primarily to Executive Chef Tyler Demora, who finds ways to combine flavors and textures and presentation that make diners say, ""Wow."" Every time I go there, I try something new, and I am never disappointed. If you're a foodie and especially appreciate locally sourced foods, this is the place for you."
December 17, 2014|12/17/14 visit w/family. Food was great,...|5|12/17/14 visit w/family. Food was great, waitress clueless but punctual. Chef sent us special appetizer which was well received by all at table. No matter how good the food is, the delivery and presentation is integral to an overall experience. Invest in hiring competent staffers for future. Still tipped 23% for general principle & holiday spirit.
December 10, 2014|Too Salty|3|Food was over salted and not as good as we we remembered unfortunately. Not sure what the chef was thinking. Waitress was slow and inattentive. We will give it one more try as we had fond memories
December 7, 2014|see below|3|The restaurant is lovely, as is the bar: a renovated old hotel, and the service was agreeable, but one has the impression that no on is minding the shop. We had brunch there on Sunday, and the espresso machine was out of order; then, the bread order didn't come, so there was no bread (they finally found some English muffins, served under-toasted); and the home fries emerged cold. This is a shame, since the menu is nice (includes clam chowder, for instance), the tables are spacious and not crowded, and it could be a major attraction. Perhaps they expect most of their business in the evenings.
December 6, 2014|Just Keeps Getting Better!|5|We have always liked 121, but since we eat almost 100% vegetarian lately we had been hitting a few other spots, but I checked out the updated menu online (super appreciate that) and they had beluga lentils with roasted carrots and spaghetti squash…SOLD…so we went and the three of us had all different apps, dinner, and split a dessert and it simply could not haven been better. The gnocchi we so different and came with parsnips…delicious…the butternut squash soup was elevated by having a little heat on the end. They also FINALLY had a good bottle of zinfandel on the menu for under $40! It was a great night!
December 6, 2014|Definately A Foodie Favourite|4|I took my wife here for her birthday. The staff was very friendly and attentive. One can really taste the freshness in the quality of the food here. If you have an extensive palette, this is definately a place to dine at.
November 24, 2014|great meal on a quiet fall night|4|Went w/ a group of 4 on a quiet Monday. Service attentive, friendly and prompt. Bench seat was a bit uncomfortable at first, but I quickly forgot about it. Pace of meal was timed well - our enjoyment was read well by the wait staff. The Silver Fox Rabbit was excellent, and the accompanying veggies and sauces outstanding. I would order this again - highly recommend.
November 22, 2014|Nice restaurant. Good food, good service...|4|Nice restaurant. Good food, good service and a reasonably priced wine list. The focus on local ingredients is something that we are seeing from a number of restaurants these days, and it sounds like this restaurant was ahead of the curve.
November 16, 2014|While my meal was not quite to my liking...|5|While my meal was not quite to my liking, my husband's was delicious and our charcuterie starter was outstanding. They also gave us free glasses of champagne for our anniversary, which was a very nice touch.
November 16, 2014|Good menu, not much for vegetarians|3|I do not eat red meat, but I eat poultry and seafood. Brunch is usually easy for me because eggs are such a great non-red meat source of protein. I was a little surprised to find that Local 121 had a limited number of menu items that did not include meat. When I asked to have the egg, grits and fried green tomato sandwich without the burger, the server encouraged me to order something else instead. The problem was that I really wanted the grits and fried green tomatoes. He did order that for me, but the fried green tomatoes were missing. On the positive side, the restaurant was very quiet and my friend and I were able to site for a quite a while and catch up. The quality of the food we received was good. I would go back again, but probably not for brunch.
November 14, 2014|We will be back!!! You won't regret it.|5|This restaurant has amazing food, creative menu full of food I want to eat! A bit on the higher side for prices, however they are very upfront with pricing and I think the value for the food is there! You won't regret it - despite the vagueness. I went about a month ago - we had chicken something, brussels, pickled something - amazing :)
November 14, 2014|great people, unimpressive food|3|they tried very hard, soup very good. meat seriously underdone [served rare] despite request for medium and having sent it back twice....servers very solicitous, allowed for another selection. navajho flatbread hard to cut, bland sorry piece of chewy bread
November 10, 2014|Never disappoints|5|Once again, we had a fantastic meal!! My spouse and I have been here several times, but it was a first for our foodie son. He loved it. Can't say enough about the quality of the food, the creative preparation, the artistic presentation, and the highly professional service. Bravo to all who made it a memorable experience.
November 7, 2014|The grass looked greener|4|A fantastic cocktail set the stage for a wonderful experience and a shared appetizer of short rib-stuffed calamari kept the expectation level high. The play of flavors and textures in the calamari was intense and surprising enough to both satisfy and to ratchet up anticipation for the entrees. Alas, the bland mess that lay beneath the composition of the wilted Caesar salad with lobster failed to meet the standard set. There are, it seems, subtleties that lay beyond my ability to appreciate. The charcuterie plate served to the neighboring table looked and smelled wonderful - they made the better choice that night.
November 1, 2014|Unique dinners and drinks|5|This restaurant never disappoints. The menu is always interesting along with the seasonal cocktails. Service is attentive. Worth the trip.
October 18, 2014|OpenTable?  What OpenTable?|4|"Got a last minute table through OpenTable. Host said, ""OpenTable always pushes reservations through when there are now tables."" We were seated in the bar, which is not nearly as nice as the restaurant. It was my anniversary dinner with my wife, so was kind of a disappointment."
October 17, 2014|Soup was very good, a little spicier tha...|4|Soup was very good, a little spicier than I like, but the basic flavor was superb. The sausage dish was good. The scallops were ordinary. We got stuck in traffic and were an hour late getting to the restaurant. The maitre d' bent over backwards to accommodate us and provide liaison with our dinner guest who was coming separately.
October 11, 2014|Not hitting that high bar anymore|3|Not a huge sample size, granted, but the last two meals here haven't hit the high bar that Local 121 used to. The atmosphere is still great, the dishes (in theory) are what you want them to be at Local 121, but the executions miss the mark. Examples: a gummy take on stuffies (you'd hope they would elevate them past their mainstream tendencies); a massive plate of calamari that looked awesome, and elements were awesome (like the sauce), but the thin slivers of squid end up buried by the batter and tired me out by bite #4; a straight ahead drinks order that was just ok -any place could do it - it lacked that extra mile I hope for here. Maybe it was the Saturday rush or perhaps the dining scene in PVD is passing the old front runner by.
October 10, 2014|A nice find|3|Surprised by the luxe dining room (velvet booths and supper club feel) which made the night feel special (though we felt comfortable being casually dressed, as were most diners). Starters were super delicious (charcuterie plate, the calamari with an outrageous pair of sauces, plus a green salad with inspired touches, were the standouts); only misfire a tomatillo thing that was an ambitious reach between soup and salad and just did not quite get where it was headed. Mains were not as successful and a heavy hand with salt made it hard to find the subtleties in all the beautifully sourced and creatively combined ingredients.
October 3, 2014|Perfect choice!|5|Decided to eat here because of the emphasis on locally grown and cultivated products.Was not disappointed. Food was outstanding, service was flawless, ambiance was perfect. Couldn't ask for a better, more comfortable and relaxing place to be after a hectic week and an arduous commute from Connecticut. Although we didn't stay for it - looked like the nightlife in the bar area was setting up to be fun as well.
September 30, 2014|food always great here|4|The food was great as always, but I was disappointed in the service this time around. I was with business associates from a conference and wanted everything to go well. One of our diners did not get her entree for quite awhile. The waitress was good in all other aspects and she was very honest telling the diner that she had forgotten to put her order in with the rest of ours. The diner was very gracious, so we were all a bit surprised that she was not even comped on her desert...or something! I was a waitress for several years and I would definlitely had at least given her a free desert or some break on her check. That was disappointing.
September 27, 2014|Disappointing This Time|2|I have eaten at Local 121 many times since they opened. The food has always been outstanding, except for September 27, 2014. My Mahi Mahi was disappointing, served at room temp with an unimpressive presentation. My dining companion ordered the pork. She was told that the dish was made with pork tenderloin which could not be accurate given the amount of tendon, fat and gristle that was obvious is the pork. The meat was not thoroughly cooked and she had to send her dish back for the raw center to be addressed. The smoked potatoes where a hit. Overall this experience was not a good example of what we know Local can produce. Will visit again in the future and hope we will be wow'ed similarly to the past.
September 26, 2014|Local 121|4|I went on a Friday night. The space is great and I found the waitstaff and hostess very friendly and accommodating. The food and wine were nicely presented. The only criticism is that the food was not served hot. Our calamari was very good but room temperature. I had the rabbit, which was also not hot enough. We didn't complain or send the food back because the overall experience was great.
September 20, 2014|Very enjoyable!|4|Visiting Providence for the first time and found this gem in downtown! Great food, great service from Emily our waitress who was fantastic!
September 20, 2014|Great find!|5|I always rely on Open Table when we travel. Local 121 had great reviews and did not disappoint. We will definetly go back the next time were in RI. Our waitperson - Emily was excellent!
September 19, 2014|Great Meal|4|When I arrived I noticed that the dining room was a bit too cozy for a table for one, so I opted to site at the bar and had a great dinner. The clam chowder soup was delicious (but almost a little too thick - flavors were spot on though and there were lots of clams) and the hamburger was unbelievably flavorful (although the patties may have been a little over worked in their preparation). Overall, these are minor issues for what was a solid meal in a nice space downtown. It should definitely be on the dinner to do list when in Providence.
September 13, 2014|Gem|5|We celebrated out 26th Wedding Anniversary at Local 121 and had a wonderful time. The food was outstanding, the ambiance was terrific, our server, Emma, was attentive w/o being intrusive. Overall we had a WONDERFUL time. We loved the food. Portion sizes were perfect (not large, but enough to make us happy). The food, full of flavor (which is an understatement). We felt like we had an opportunity to try things that we'd never put together, which worked so perfectly!
September 7, 2014|Providence Perfect|4|Local 121, with its emphasis on local products and California inspired Nouvelle Cuisine and presentation delighted us. The simple yet refined salad dressing, fish, accompanied by a cream mustard sauce, chicken,cheeses and vegetables were prepared beautifully. While we rarely eat dessert, the star of the evening was the Chocolate Pave : rich, velvet chocolate , dark and not sweet. Perfect! Chef Ryan stopped by to accept our compliments.
September 6, 2014|Excellent|5|Probably my favorite restaurant in Prov. Always fabulous food, great ambiance.
September 5, 2014|Just Wonderful|5|We loved everything about our visit to Local 121. The food was not only locally sourced but also absolutely delicious. Try the calamari - the tomato butter sauce it comes in was unbelievable.
August 24, 2014|I visit Local 121 each time I'm in downt...|5|I visit Local 121 each time I'm in downtown Providence and love this restaurant. The food and service never disappoint. The restaurant is elegant and romantic and it's a very special place. I look forward to my next visit.
August 22, 2014|Great for a special night|5|The menu, drink list, and service were all above expectations. It's a very quiet, so it's a great place to go with your significant other or small group to simply enjoy each others company.
August 7, 2014|Service A+ Food C|3|Local 121 was a mixed dining experience for us. The complimentary valet parking was appreciated. The service was simply outstanding. I loved the Velvet Jone srum cocktail. Where we came up short was with the food. The scallops appetiser was terrific but the other three small plates we order, zucchini soup, calamari and foie gras where, at best, adequate. We did not walk away dazzled by the culiary prowess in the kitchen. A shame given how well the front of the house was managed.
August 3, 2014|August 4, 2014|5|We found the host very friendly. Both brunch dishes were delicious. We had the Eggs Benedict with smoked trout and the Pork Belly with grits and cheese. It was our anniversary, and even though the eggs came out at room temperature, it was replaced as quickly as possible, and we were rewarded with a wonderful blueberry dessert personally delivered by the pastry chef and no additional charge. The English Muffins used in the Eggs Benedict are made in the restaurant, and we were later given a hand-written copy of the recipe with the chef's personal phone number in case we had any questions. We will definitely go back!
July 30, 2014|Work lunch|3|"In the past, my (brunch and dinner) experience at Local 121 had been great, but this (lunch) time it was mixed. The portion sizes were inconsistent -- some sandwiches required extra large plates, but the pasta and quiche were starter-size, even though there is a separate ""small plates"" section. When we asked about the tossed greens that were supposed to come with the quiche, we were brought two small plates with just green lettuce leaves, after we had finished the quiche. The quiche was quite tasty, but the presentation was disappointing and the portion left one of us hungry, while some of the sandwiches were not finished."
July 29, 2014|Great Find|5|Went on the recommendation of a friend and it was a great recommendation. Fresh food, friendly service, great atmosphere. Went on a first date and they gave us plenty of time to talk, peruse the menu and had helpful hints about what would be the better choice. Food came quickly and was amazing. My date just kept saying how nice the place was, how delicious the food was and how great of a time it was. Made breaking the ice that much easier for me. Would recommend again and again to anyone looking for a fresh, locally grown meal.
July 19, 2014|Beautiful yet a bit pricy|4|The restaurant was great, much more classy than what we expected from the pictures! Perfect for romantic dinners. Price vary from 15 to 30+ $ so be careful what you order
July 19, 2014|Wonderful dining experience|5|This was my second visit to Local 121, and it did not disappoint. We brought out of town guests for the first time. All concerns for us were exceptional.....atmosphere, service and food. This restaurant is a gem....from the moment you walk in the door and are greeted with a friendly smile, until you are so satisfied at the completion of your meal, and YOU walk out with the smile! I will be back!
July 12, 2014|Lovely night|4|Another lovely night in Providence at a neighborhood anchor. Delicious dinner.
July 8, 2014|Excellent|5|Everything from the appetizer to the pork tenderloin to the dessert was outstanding...

However, we decided that this is neither good nor bad news. The place was really nice and cozy and the food was absolutely delicious. Definitely ready to come back!
July 1, 2014|The food was excellent. My only complain...|5|The food was excellent. My only complaint was the limited menu, but I understood going in that the menu would be limited because they serve only locally sourced food. Preparation was outstanding. I had the rabbit which was juicy and delicious. My wife had an the marinated squid and shellfish appetizer as her main course and loved it. The dining room has white table clothes and the bar is old mahogany - reminder of the fancy restaurants of years gone by. Now added to my favorite restaurant list.
June 28, 2014|Delicious|5|All the dishes we had were delicious and very well presented. The portions were the right size and the desserts outstanding. The service was quick and professional.
June 27, 2014|Incredible Food, Great Ambience|5|Local 121 is another of Providence's great culinary gems. The food is delicious, creatively developed, with excellent artistic plating. A night at Local 121 is one that should not be missed.
June 26, 2014|Long time patrons very disappointed|2|Food quality has fallen dramatically. It's like the kitchen doesn't care any more, very sad.
June 26, 2014|A Standout|4|local 121 is very close to the convention center. We chose it for that reason but frankly expected to trade a quality experience for that convenience. We were wrong. It was a unique and varied menu, a lovely, elegant setting, with very good service and reasonable prices. They handle couples and large crowds equally well. Our group had pasta, two types of seafood, and vegitarian- everyone was delighted with their choices.
June 22, 2014|Poor Experience|1|The tempura beans were very greasy, the calm chowder too salty, the service mediocre, the ambience very loud next room, out of Monk Fish early on a Monday evening... Bad choice... very pretentious... boss must have been out.
June 14, 2014|Wonderful|5|We really enjoyed local 121. Staff, food and chef are great. It truly is a treat as the menu is unique.
June 13, 2014|Disappointed|2|My last visit here was over 5 years ago and I remember a delicious fresh local menu and great service. Sadly none of that was here anymore. We were conveniently seated quickly thanks to our reservation, however that might have been the only plus. The menu was strange and didn't have really anything exciting... The service was slow and messy (ie beer spills and fork dropping). Way too overpriced for a half non-edible monkfish and boring cod. Just a sad experience. Will not be back.
June 13, 2014|Place to go!|5|My friend and I go to Local 121 every time we have tickets to Trinity. There is valet parking that keeps our car for the entire evening. Our table is always ready. The food comes in a timely fashion so we can enjoy a leisurely meal and get to the play on time. Food is all fresh, creative, and proportionally perfect. I HIGHLY recommend this place!
June 7, 2014|Great Food Presentation & Delicious|5|Local 121 still has the most unique menu around with local produce and dishes. I loved the Hudson Valley Foie Gras! I was especially impressed this time with the elegance and artfulness of the dishes presented, and of course the food was very tasty as well. Service was very attentive. The round booths feel like a fun retro throw back, and I will want to sit in them again. But there is a large distance between the booth and the table that makes it a tad uncomfortable. Wonderful dinner experience overall and hope to return.
May 31, 2014|Great dinner|5|We were a group of 6 with 4 vegetarians. Menu has a lot of choices for all diets. I love the fresh local flavors. The service was just right -attentive but not overbearing. A nice wine list and excellent cocktails.
May 30, 2014|My one complaint...|3|...was that I asked that my steak be cooked medium (hot pink center) and it came out rare (bright red, practically still mooing). They took it back, cooked it to my liking but did not offer any kind of discount which I think is unusual for a restaurant of this caliber.
May 27, 2014|Great Birthday Dinner|4|My fiance and I came here for dinner for her 27th birthday. It was a Tuesday so the restaurant wasn't too busy but that did not take away from our experience. Our waitress was very attentive and the food was great, get the charcuterie plate! Will definitely be back.
May 23, 2014|always the best|5|there is simply no comparable experience in PVD to dining at Local 121
May 18, 2014|our second visit|4|Our second visit and we will be back.....great place for post theater dinner
May 11, 2014|Brunch at 121|4|We had mothers day brunch. The setting is nice and comfortable. Friendly service. Different and tradtional foods locally sourced.
May 11, 2014|outstanding!|5|So impressed with our latest experience at Local 121! Great service, delicious food, and amazing cocktails (the bartender deserves an award)! 5 stars!
May 9, 2014|Fantastic Birthday Dinner|5|Once again, our meal was flawless. Love the ambiance -- low-keyed elegance, tasteful music at just the right decibel level. Kayla was, once again, our server and was, once again, absolutely superlative. And the food was beyond description -- beautifully presented, perfectly cooked, creatively conceived. We will return again and again!!!
May 8, 2014|Outstanding|5|My wife and I had been here for lunch, but this was the first time for dinner. We came for a pre theater meal...had 2 appetizers and split an enter. Everything was fantastic. The server count not have been better
May 6, 2014|Perfect before a PPAC show|4|This was our second visit to this restaurant. Once again my girlfriend and I were having dinner before a show at the PPAC. We like the local aspect at this establishment. The dining room is elegant, the service is friendly and the prices are affordable for fine dining. They knew we were headed to the show and accomodated us without feeling rushed. We had the cheese plate as an app. Three cheeses were served, each with it's own complementary side that I never would have guessed go together. I recomend it.
May 4, 2014|Been here before. |5|Very good food. Fit for foodies and others. Very good service. Open early on Sunday for brunch. Convenient downtown location.
May 1, 2014|Our first visit and I consider this rest...|5|Our first visit and I consider this restaurant in the top 5 in Providence
May 1, 2014|Our before theater dinner was excellent....|4|Our before theater dinner was excellent. Inventive menu. Expertly prepared. My beef tartar with quail egg is just one example of a very nice riff on a classic. The swiss chard dolmas were also outstanding. These two apps made for a perfect light supper.
April 28, 2014|Mirror mirror|4|Monday night dinner with my family. Cool ambience with mirrors dominating the decor. Excellent service, delicious food though it seemed like there should have been more pasta dishes, but too loud. Get the scallops as an appetizer. Fantastic.
April 25, 2014|Menu Selection|4|Everything about the restaurant was very good except the limited menu selection. This was disappointing to us so check it out online if it is available. As I recall the selection included fish (pollock and fluke), burgers, chicken, spaghetti, lamb and a vegetarian dish. However, what was served was excellent taste and presented well.
April 23, 2014|Good but not Great|4|I was in Providence for a conference and ended up going to Local 121 twice. Both dinners were good. Service was great. The food was good, but was not great. Nothing really wrong, just no wow factor.
April 20, 2014|Bad Easter Experience|1|We had high expectations for Easter brunch as Go Local Providence had suggested they have one of the best brunches. Food was bad. Dry French toast, burnt chicken fingers, etc... A fast food restaurant would have been better. Menu selection poor. Service clueless.
April 19, 2014|Where's the lunch menu on Saturday?|4|We were very disappointed to learn they switched to a brunch menu on Saturday. We arrived at 1230 and we so looking forward to one of their delicious sandwiches and we were presented with a brunch menu. Yuck. I mean, nothing satisfies like a meatloaf panini when you want a meatloaf panini. This is a favorite place for us to stop before PPAC and now we may venture back to Aspire if for nothing else than a lunch menu. Save brunch-only option for Sunday!
April 17, 2014|Fantastic|5|Started with creative cocktails from seasonal menu which were tasty and interesting, fry bread app was great (beat mole I've ever had), steak with marrow jam potato was rich and delicious, Statler chicken was perfectly cooked and sauced expertly. Will definitely be back.
April 9, 2014|Dining At Local 121|4|My wife and I went to Local 121 prior to going to the theater. We were seated promptly and the entrees arrived at adequate times so we did not miss the opening. The food was very good; my wife had two small plates that were adequate for her diet and I had a salad and pollack. We shared a dessert, Overall a very nice evening.
April 4, 2014|Amazing flavors!|5|This was our first date night in over 6 months and I am SO glad we selected Local 121. From the complimentary beet potato chip with homemade dressing, to the navajo fry bread, the charcuterie plate, the burger, the rabbit - it was all absolutely incredible. The flavors were so fresh that you could taste each individually. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Fantastic restaurant. Its a bit dark in there, but other than that we absolutely loved it.
April 2, 2014|Good Experience|4|The restaurant was a bit slow at the initial time we got there but picked up very quickly. The waitress was very attentive and helpful. The food also tasted great! I had the spicy masala and was a little surprised at the small portion and how fancy it was set up, but it was delicious!
March 9, 2014|Three eggs, no way.|2|What a disappointment this restaurant was. We were there for Sunday Brunch. The service was friendly but slow. When the food finally arrived it was disappointing: flat, hard, scrambled eggs. When I asked if this was how they were usually prepared the waitress said yes. The cubed vegetables: sweet potatoes, turnip and carrots? were alternately soft and hard and a poor accompaniment. The toast was late in coming - one slice each, and barely toasted. A mistake on one order wasn't rectified (sausage instead of kielbasa). As this was to have been a treat for our grand daughter who is a student in Providence we plowed through to dessert but didn't chance anything but the ice cream.
March 1, 2014|Hidden gem|4|Loca 121 was one of the few places showing open tables this past Saturday night when we decided to go out last minute with friends. What a treat. The rabbit was incredible as was the quail. Food and ambiance were exceptional, service was good but not on par. No complaints, just not as amazing as everything else.
March 1, 2014|Great pre show dinning|5|Eaten here many times. The menu changes. But, everything is always wonderful. The hostess (Emily) along with our server (Emma) were both excellent. I have a gluten allergy, and they are very accomodating. Would strongly recommend 121 to anyone going to PPAC, Dunk, or Convention Center. Won't be disappointed!
February 28, 2014|old people|4|good food, decent service. eat at the outstanding bar. dining room is older crowd. everyone was slowly dying.
February 28, 2014|Great Night|5|From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere, staff, drinks, and food were all wonderful! You are tempted to try new combinations of flavors you probably never experienced, and you will not be disappointed! Hats off to the Chef! It was yummo...
February 28, 2014|Very disappointing|2|We arrived for a 5:00 reservation & entree arrived at 6:30; we did receive bread & our appetizer during this time. My appetizer was a root vegetable casserole which did not come in a casserole just a few spoonfuls of cubed vegetables on a plate; there were no nuts, dates and figs in the appetizer as it stated in the menu. When I finally got our server, she said that she was sorry that she did not see it since she did not deliver it; she brought a small plate with a little of each on it but at this point most of my appetizer was already eaten. I ordered the beet steak entree & when it came it was basically sliced beets with nothing on top with a spoonful of quinoa on the side. The beets were somehow very salty and the quinoa was very good.
February 23, 2014|The food was outstanding,|5|The food was outstanding, the service appropriately attentive and knowledgeable, and the ambience conducive to to quiet conversation and enjoyment of the experience.
Dined on February 21, 2014|Pre-Theater Dinner|5|After informing our server, Lindsay, that we had tickets to a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center, she took very good care of us. We had a wonderful relaxing meal, were not rushed at all and were out of there in plenty of time to walk the short distance to the show we were going to. My foie gras torchon appetizer was delicious as was my rabbit pappardelle main. Likewise, my wife thoroughly enjoyed her chestnut and mushroom salad (a special) and her open ravioli (vegetarian version) with sunchokes, black trumpet duxelle, winter truffle and ricotta. We will definitely go back again.
February 12, 2014|Excellent pre-theater choice|4|Local 121 is a short walk from Trinity Rep and the best pre-theater dinner option. Cool decor, with friendly and attentive service. Extensive wine selection, we each tried wine we had not had before, and both were great new discoveries. The only shortcoming of Local 121, in my opinion, is that the menu is somewhat limited in scope. However, both of us were extremely pleased with our entrees (try the Vermont Rabbit, with house pappardelle, prunes, bitter chocolate, rabbit demi-glace). I also recommend the creme brulee.
February 10, 2014|True hospitality|5|Wonderful evening. Delightful service from Emma and Chef Tyler is truly talented as every dish was marvelous
February 7, 2014|A little disappointed|3|"My husband and I had dinner before Trinity Rep Friday evening and we were both a little disappointed in our second visit. The first time we came was last summer with friends and we both recall enjoying the food a great deal. This time, however, expect for the Panzanella salad, which was very tasty, we both felt it was kind of ""eh."" We'll probably choose another restaurant next time."
February 1, 2014|Nice birthday lunch|4|Great place. The server was a little cranky. But otherwise excellent experience. I would go back.
January 25, 2014|Nice Change|5|"Really diverse and different menu. Two couples and we shared a lot of appetizers, got entrees, dessert, drinks and didn't get killed on the bill and didn't feel ""over stuffed"". Well done and we will be back."
January 25, 2014|For the price of the food,|1|For the price of the food, you can go to several much better restaurants. Do not waist your money here. The price and quality do not equal.
January 18, 2014|Perfection from the beginning|5|If you like meat, do yourself a favor and order the charcuterie for your appetizer. My goodness it is a dazzling and thoughtful dish! It's the kind of plate that underscores the pride the chef takes in taking care of his guests (not to mention talent). Both our server and our food runner were attentive, friendly and knowledgeable, and I really liked the wine list (being partial to Napa wines, but liking New World wines as well as local wines, the list had a nice selection). I've been to Local 121 before and I will certainly return. It's one of my favorite Rhode Island restaurants.
January 17, 2014|I walked in and the ambience|4|I walked in and the ambience was very nice, the staff was friendly and helpful. The bar area is really nice and relaxed. We were a group o 5 got a nice booth table, everyone loved the food, the burger, squash, pollock and pasta. Overall a good experience will definitely go again!
January 12, 2014|Great stop before the show|5|We went for brunch before a matinée at the performing arts center. Super close! Just park once and walk. The food and service were wonderful!
January 11, 2014|Top Notch As Always!|5|Local 121 is always a pleasure. We stop here about once a month for lunch prior to PPAC and have a great fondness for their seasonal food and beverage menu. The service and food is always top notch. I can’t say enough good about this place. If you are on the fence, try this place!
December 28, 2013|Love almost all of it!|4|Arrived for a 5:00 reservation and asked if we could have a quick drink at the bar and much to our surprise, they said we could. I had called earlier to see if we could arrive at 5:30 instead and was told absolutely not as they were fully booked. Seated at the bar, the bartender did everything except acknowledge us, let alone wait on us, There were 2 other parties at the bar. She crushed mint, set a table for a couple, settled a bill and made drinks for restaurant diners, before she acknowledged us. We actually considered leaving because of her service. When we were finally waited on, we took our bottle of wine to our table. Everything quickly turned around. Kala was fantastic, the food was exceptional, all at a reasonable price.
December 22, 2013|We went off-hours, so the|5|We went off-hours, so the low noise level might not be typical. Service was exceptionally attentive. Food was varied, tasty, beautifully presented. The room was small enough to feel intimate and peaceful with some tables in sofa-like alcoves, white tablecloths.
December 18, 2013|Sophisticated|4|Nice fresh ingredients in a beautiful setting. Creative menu, something for everyone, but mostly for the more adventurous palate. We loved it!
December 14, 2013|Incredible service|5|First time at this restaurant. Picked it for it's location near Trinity Rep Theater and Dunkin Donuts Center. What a find! Food was fantastic. My husband had the clam chowder and raved about it to many of his friends. And he is a chowder lover who makes his own so is not easily impressed. Love the complimentary little appetizer. Service was superb-waitress came by three time during main course to make sure all was well. Were going to a show after dinner but had plenty of time for coffee and dessert since the service was so fast.
December 12, 2013|Tasty Find Near Convention Center|4|"Convenient from the Providence Convention Center, this ""neighborhood gem"" features locally sourced dishes. It's a pretty good New American restaurant, and my potato soup and the housemade pasta were very tasty. The cod fritters were good, but I wasn't blown away. The bread was pretty tasty, too."
December 7, 2013|Some of the portions were|3|Some of the portions were meager in size and /or lacked vegetables. The desserts were creative and delicious.
December 7, 2013|Very Slow Service|3|The food was excellent, but the service left a lot to be desired. Do not go to this restaurant unless you want to sit around for a long time waiting for your food to arrive. Especially do not go to this restaurant if you have tickets to a play as the first act will be over by the time you finish your meal. We will never go to this restaurant again only because of the service that we experienced.
December 5, 2013|Close to PPAC|5|We had a wonderful, sumptuous meal before attending the show at PPAC. The ambience, quality of food, service, and the proximity to PPAC made for a wonderful evening. We will be back!
December 3, 2013|We had a wonderful dinner|5|"We had a wonderful dinner - the menu is interesting, they use mostly locally sourced foods, service was excellent, prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere is quite ""posh"" though comfortable. I had Spaghetti (homemade) with a Mushroom (local) Ragu and Veal Meatballs. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the ragu.... I wanted to lick the bowl! We did not have time to visit the bar side, but I look forward to returning to either side."
November 30, 2013|We have eaten here several|4|We have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. It is in an ideal location. The food is good. The wait staff is excellent. A must if you are going to a show downtown. They also have a brand new menu that includes many of their specials. I do miss the scallops wrapped in bacon thou.
November 30, 2013|Nice experience before a PPAC show|5|Enjoyed a nice dinner before phantom at PPAC. Our bartender was friendly for our before dinner cocktails. Our server was great. (Looked like Kirsten Dunst) Food was delicious (calamari, hangar steak, Brussel sprouts, rabbit and bass) and timed well to get us to show on time yet not feel rushed. We had a lovely time and would go again.
November 29, 2013|Delicious Local 121|4|Old world, dark wood sumptuous feel. Staff very welcoming and attentive. Ordered calamari. Had to ask for lemon. Ordered RI black bass (2 men each had this), an orange-ginger laquered duck breast cooked medium, and a phyllo and kale crusted albacore tuna. Everything was cooked to perfection. No vege/carb included. Bass was 4-5 small pieces of fish. Tuna was better size and delicious. Duck was three pieces cooked perfectly at medium. So my only gripe would be that giving the eater a complimentary vegetable would be a great addition.
November 27, 2013|Sublime|5|I've been fortunate to dine at 121 about 4 times now. Each time the ambiance is sophisticated, warm, and inviting. The food seems so carefully prepared. I am a vegetarian, and any veggie dish I've gotten has been creative, and extremely delicious. My carnivore companions devour their dishes with great delight also. Cocktails are perfect. Cheese plate was inspired. The other amazing part of this restaurant is the extremely good service. The staff somehow blends fine dining with warmth and friendliness. They are a joy to converse with, and you feel very well taken care of! It is truly worth every penny:-).
November 27, 2013|Farm to table at its finest|4|Food is delicious and perfectly prepared. Presentation was beautiful. Service is attentive and pleasant. We did not feel rushed. Local 121 is a great place to unwind.
November 23, 2013|In a word.... Brilliant|5|We enjoyed a great meal and cocktails enjoying a lovely interior. We will be back.
November 14, 2013|A nice find in Downtown Providence|4|"Somewhat eclectic, LOCAL121 delivers a really nice dining experience. The duck was fabulous, steak perfectly cooked and clam chowder beautifully prepared. Decor is a little odd, but otherwise very comfortable and very ""warm"". Nice wine list and very friendly service."
November 9, 2013|Excellent spot for lunch|5|Took my sister and niece here for lunch when I went to visit her at school. We started off with the clam chowder which was very flavorful and not too thick as it can sometimes be. Had fried calamari which were tender and delicious and for lunch I had the scallop dish, which was light, but the waitress had forewarned me. They were great, however, and I would get them again. Overall, wonderful ambiance, and very good food in the heart of Providence.
November 8, 2013|Came here our first night|4|Came here our first night when we arrived. Food was delicious, we had the scallops as an appetizer, the pappardelle and braised beef as our main course. Only criticism was that the food was too salty for our taste, a comment we saw many times on reviews on yelp. Overall good experience!
November 1, 2013|Fantastic, as always!|5|Love this place! Food, ambiance and service is tops!
October 23, 2013|Server was outstanding|4|Emily, our server, was funny and patient with our group. She made the night even more fun!
October 19, 2013|Wow - Excellent dining experience|5|Local 121 was fantastic and beyond. The ambience was lovely and the food was delicious and the dishes were thoughtful. Our server was pleasant and well informed. I'm looking forward to my next visit.
October 19, 2013|Wonderful except for poor table|4|Overall we had a lovely experience at this farm to table restaurant in Downcity Providence. We took my daughter and her friend who are culinary students at JWU and we had a great time talking about and tasting all the food. The service was very good as was the food. My only complaint was our table location. We were seated at a four top right by the door and maitre d' station. It was obviously the worst seat in the house. We asked for another but were denied. I find this frequently when I book through open table that we are seated in obviously poor seating. What was even more discouraging was that there were obviously plenty of other 4 tops available.
October 19, 2013|half the menu was missing|2|We were told that many items on the menu were not available since it was the last day before converting to the fall menu. Sadly, this meant that every item we were interested in ordering wasn't available. I would have loved to have known that ahead of time. The items that we did order were very small and expensive, and not that delicious. We ate at a lot of different restaurants that weekend we were visiting Providence and found many that had far better food, service and prices. It was a disappointment.
October 17, 2013|The food was nice, but way|3|The food was nice, but way too much time passed between the first and second courses. And the place was very noisy; it would benefit from sound-absorbing material in the room.
October 13, 2013|Disappointed, this time . . .|2|It's our third or fourth time back to this neighborhood bistro. Dinner service was slow as molasses, and food was spotty. Dining room looks like it needs a facelift all of a sudden . . . but bar is great, maybe we should have eaten there. The salad was weird, giant leaves with virtually no dressing but for globs of cheese. Lobster ravioli ok, but those bits of lobster meat had been around (somewhere) for a while . . . Dessert was good but clearly made up hours before and kept in fridge under wrap--Saran Wrap that is. We'll try again sometime but not soon. Sorry!
October 13, 2013|What a night!|5|Took my parents there for their 62nd wedding anniversary. Emma, our waitperson, was perfect - she answered questions, listened to my dad, and delivered everything with a smile. The food, as usual, was great - with the exception of the over-fried pierogies. My parents felt very special and that was the point. Thank you Local 121!
October 12, 2013|It was only ok.|3|We've been to Local 121 before and loved it. This time however it wasn't nearly as good. Meat was dry. Broccoli rabe was bitter. When we said something to the waiter, we were told that's the way it's supposed to be. Really?? Our bill came to $150, including tip. We won't be back.
October 12, 2013|Simply Awesome|5|Local 121 has become our favorite go-to restaurant for weekend outings; it's great for a dinner date, to impress visitors from out of town, or to celebrate a birthday, etc. Food and service never disappoints!
October 12, 2013|121 is cool!|5|We have made this a RISD college tradition with our son and his friends. A real treat and it always a terrific evening. Look forward to our next visit to Providence.
Dined on October 11, 2013|BEST EVER!|5|Tremendous on all fronts! You will love this restaurant!
October 5, 2013|Great night|4|We had a really lovely time at Local 121. They present a really nice seasonal menu with a fine selection of alternatives to appease any palate; including cocktails, wine, and beer. The restaurant is comfortable with a pleasant ambiance and the waitstaff is attentive. I enjoyed my Stracciatella, and our party enjoyed the bluefish pate. Our steaks were cooked as ordered, well seasoned, and the accompanying sauces were well balanced. The Milk Chocolate Mousse was delicious. Definitely worth a visit if you live in Providence or are just passing through.
October 4, 2013|Still hungry after have lunch|3|Each of us ordered one different meal for lunch. Actually the food was so mini size and most of us still feel hungry after lunch. Although the food was good, it looked like my friends were not so satisfied.
October 1, 2013|delicious duck|5|Everything was very flavourful. The duck breast was amazing - juicy, not too fatty, bigger portion than expected.
September 29, 2013|Unique dishes, great ambiance|5|Went here for dinner during a work conference and LOVED it. We opted to pick a bunch of the small plates so we could try several things and we were not disappointed. I had a delicious glass of wine and we loved the decor/feel of the restaurant.
September 28, 2013|Unfailingly excellent!|5|We've eaten at Local 121 several times and have always been well-pleased with the excellent food and service as well as the elegant decor. Early dinner prior to Waterfire and the next day's half-marathon event. Had delicious Lamb Sausage Merguez - spicy Moroccan-style sausage with tender grilled eggplant and the Catch of the Day, Cod Fish and Chips. The fish was lightly-battered and not the least bit greasy; the frites were perfect! Local 121 is a consistently good choice for well-prepared creative dishes. Already looking forward to the next time!
September 25, 2013|Lovely Pre-theater dinner choice|5|We enjoy Local 121 every time we go before a performance at Trinity Rep, just up the street. Delicious food, excellent service, lovely setting.
September 22, 2013|Excellent service, wonderful|4|Excellent service, wonderful food and ambience.....moderately priced.....bar resembles Campbelll's Apartment in Grand Central Station...a big plus......makes for a great evening
September 20, 2013|Theatrenight|5|We got dinner before a show at Trinity and it was spectacular! No complaints.
September 19, 2013|terrific|5|everything was perfect. Our waitress Emily is simply one of the warmest and most knowledgeable servers we have ever encountered. eating with her is better than dining at home. combine the terrific food and sauces of chef dave, the beautiful style and decor of the space, and the tremendous service, this is definitely the best restaurant in town.
September 14, 2013|A Fine Dining Experience|4|Interesting choices, Nice presentation, Well-sized portions, Delicious taste, Attentive service.
September 6, 2013|Heavy on the salt|3|This dinner had the possibility of being wonderful starting with the delicious bread and butter. We had the seasonal vegetable broccoli which was very tasty as an appetizer and one of our group of 4 remarked just a bit salty but that it brought out the flavor. The rest of the dishes from the beautiful and perfectly cooked swordfish to the homemade cavatelli (which we sent back to be redone without salt - then a wonderful dish) could not be fully appreciated because salt was one of the dominant notes. Dessert choices give a clue to the chef's love of salt - a chocolate bread pudding made with pretzels and chocolate dessert with bacon sprinkled as garnish. If I went back I would definitely ask the chef to go light on or exclude the salt.
September 3, 2013|consistently tremendous|5|the entire experience here make this the best restaurant in pvd. greatest waitress ever: Emily. fantastic food, perfect ambiance and warm yet disciplined service.
September 1, 2013|Yum!!!!|5|The food was outstanding. The tomatoes in the heirloom tomato salad melted in your mouth. The scallops wrapped in bacon were some of the best I've ever had. The homemade garden mint ice cream tasted like real mint, not the fake mint extract. I would go back to Providence just to return to this restaurant.
August 25, 2013|Terrific brunch|5|All the elements of the breakfast sandwich (housemade sausage, cheese, good eggs, biscuit, crisp arugula) combined splendidly, home fries done just right, good coffee, a blueberry muffin to die for - I'd go out on a limb and say that whatever their Pastry of the Day is when you go, it shouldn't be missed. Service was well-informed, friendly and fast.
August 24, 2013|Fantastic!|5|The food, the ambience, and our server Kayla were all amazing! Thank you Kayla for being so sweet and attentive! We will be back!
August 12, 2013|Take someone special here|5|My husband and I had our last dinner in Providence here based on Omni Hotel concierge recommenation. Be sure to arrive early so that you can appreciate the gorgeous dark woodwork and leaded windows in the bar area that on the night we vistited was glowing with tea candles.The dining room is equally beautiful and our meals did not disappoint. My husband had the rabbit and I the sea bass and both were perfect and artistically presented. The chick pea crusted calamari as a shared appetizer was outstanding and we both would recommend this dish that is so often offered but rarely done so well done. We felt we could linger over our expressos and grand marnier and savor the meal we had just enjoyed. Wouldn't change a thing here.
August 9, 2013|Pricey nice atmosphere and service|4|I found my meal to be overpriced for what it was. I had the catch of the day which was good, but slightly over-cooked. Serving size was extremely small and left me still hungry. If I spend that much to go out to eat, I want it to be something better than I can make at home, this wasn't. Very neat atmosphere and super friendly staff. I'll return for drinks, but probably not to eat again.
August 6, 2013|Excellent!!|5|Atmosphere, food, and service were outstanding! I felt like I was in a prohibition era supper club! It was fantastic.
July 27, 2013|Fresh and local food|5|We dined here to celebrate our anniversary while traveling to our summer home. The food selections ere varied and creative. The striped bass was tasty as was my wife's vegetarian plate. We enjoyed an inexpensive bottle of rosé and a wonderful dessert.
July 20, 2013|Focus is on local|4|The food was delicious and there was a lot of variety on the menu, practically something for everyone.
July 19, 2013|Absolutely delicious|5|My wife and I stayed in Providence for the last night of our vacation. The hotel recommended this restaurant and they accepted our 10pm reservation. Every course was perfect; we couldn't think of one thing we'd change. We eat out a lot and always have at least one criticism of a restaurant...couldn't find any here.
July 18, 2013|One-of-a-kind and unforgettable|5|From the eccentric (but elegant) decor to a staff that treats you like a member of their family, this was a near-perfect experience. I made up a full, satisfying meal from the small plates alone -- one for an appetizer, two as a combo main course, and one small cheese plate to finish. (The particular dishes vary, because the chef puts a premium on seasonal, local ingredients, which change regularly.) The wine list is extensive and very good, including some good half-bottle options and a great selection by the glass. Whatever you do, arrive half an hour early so you can spend some time at the bar. It's beautiful, and the bartender really knows her stuff.
July 13, 2013|Fun for groups|5|The food is outstanding, eclectic and locally sourced. The decor of the restaurant is very fun, and comfortable. We had a group of 6 tucked into a round, cozy booth, and it was great to be able to see everyone and actually get to talk to them because of the set up. We all loved your meals. We came here for my bachelorette last year, and a group of us came back with our husbands for waterfire and I'm really happy we did. Brunch is next on my list.
July 8, 2013|Impressive local selections|4|This was a good find in Rhode Island. The menu is farm to table focused so very fresh and tasty. The cheese plate was outstanding. The duck was also very good. Wine list was reasonable and had a very good variety of options in different price ranges including 1/2 bottles. The restaurant is set up to be more formal but there were people in golf shirts and shorts. I was in a collared shirt and jeans and took my kids. Atmosphere was fine and not stuffy. Service was good and our water glasses stayed full. I would certainly come back.
July 7, 2013|Food Falls Flat|3|Beautiful space, comfy chairs, friendly service. I've been before and I'm just never impressed by the food! They have nice, creative dishes and I appreciate their use of local ingredients, I just always feel underwhelmed for the price ($100+ a couple). I love love love the bar though. Gorgeous!
July 7, 2013|Went for Breakfast|3|Went for breakfast. Food was good but we were the only table in there except for one other as we were leaving. Made it a little awkward. Will be back to try it for dinner.
June 23, 2013|Delicious Dinner|5|"We went here for a girl's night out. The portion sizes were perfect and the food delicious. The waitstaff knew the menu and were able to offer their opinion and suggestions which is always a bonus for the indecisive. We went for an early dinner and it was a little quiet and stayed for quite awhile and did not feel rushed at all. The calamari, pierogi, and scallops were all excellent choices and the rhubarb cocktail ""Little Devil"" was a popular choice at our table as well."
June 22, 2013|Delicious at a good price|4|My husband and I as well as our friends enjoy fine dining experiences, but that can get expensive very quickly. Local 121 has just enough of a gourmet touch that a foodie would be pleased without breaking the bank. We were very happy.
June 21, 2013|We haven't been to Local 121|2|We haven't been to Local 121 in over a year. Back then, it had a great menu and the food was good. It's a new menu now and we found it to be very limited, particularly for vegetarians. One person in our party had the pasta-of-the-day and enjoyed it. We even passed on dessert, and were not impressed with the selections. The restaurant vibe and ambience is great and the service was excellent.
June 19, 2013|Farm to Table|3|Enjoyed the atmosphere, ambience and food at this downtown Providence locale. Menu with nightly specials has something for everyone using local ingredients. I don't think its been open very long but being from out of town I was really sure. This place would benefit from better service as its very uneven. Wait staff was friendly but not very attentive to the small things that make a good restaurant into a better one. For example, replenishing water , drink orders and clearing plates from start to finish. I would recommend this spot to try out and hope its gets better !
June 19, 2013|Very pleasant|4|Food was creative and attractively presented. All products were very fresh.
June 16, 2013|Over Dressed|4|I think the restaurant dining area is very over dressed and somewhat stuffy. Good food though.
June 16, 2013|Slow|4|Food preparation was unusually slow on this occasion. We have eaten here before and never run into this problem previously.
June 16, 2013|Management needs to pay attention|3|"I've been to Local 121 several times. The food is always great, but the service needs attention. Twice an order for the toppings for a burger have been incorrect. The first time we had to wait for a whole new one to be cooked because it is not so easy to remove melted cheese. This time, it was possible to scrape off the unordered mushrooms. No excuse for this after we had specifically said to the waitperson that an error was made on the burger last time, and so could she please be sure to write it down correctly. This waitperson was more concerned with exhibiting her personality, however, than attuning herself to our needs. There is such a thing as intrusive ""friendliness."" The manager/owner spends more time on the floor."
June 15, 2013|Save Room for Dessert|5|Our entire meal was fabulous. The smoked bluefish was a perfect starter on the crisp crostini and the pickles added the perfect balance. The pasta of the day was delicious with season veg. But what blew my mind was the ice cream with fresh herbs on the strawberry tart. The distinct basil flavor in the ice cream was balanced and simply delightful. Brilliant!
June 15, 2013|Amazing|5|Exquisite food and service puts this wonderful restaurant at the top of Rhode Island's must go to places for any serious fine dining aficionados.
June 14, 2013|Unique spot even in Providence|5|My wife and I enjoyed truly local meat, seafood and vegetables from RI and MA over a bottle wine with a very friendly waiter. This is a great restaurant to have in Providence, bar as well is separate from the dining room with friendly prices and convenient distance to Lupo's without getting an after show crowd. Definitely a keeper.
June 14, 2013|This was my second time eating|5|This was my second time eating at Local121 and it did not dissaapoint. The food was cooked to perfection , beautifully presented , and the atmosphere fantastic.
June 13, 2013|Great execution|4|As a farm-to-table restaurant on the upper end of the spectrum, Local 121 did not dissapoint. Sweet potato pierogi's were lovely although certainly different from what my Polish grandmother would serve. The strawberry salad had a layer of ricotta under it with the crunch of chopped pistachios hiding in there. You have to love small surprises and great textures together. My wife's littlenecks with chorizo was the standout surprise - its a bit of a staple in RI, but the execution of it here was as good if not better than I've had before. My bomster scallops were very good and plentiful. The polenta under it was a tad plastic in texture but tasty. Desserts looked handmade but not revolutionary. Great meal.
Dined on June 11, 2013|Imaginative & Flavorful|3|The service was friendly, pristine and discrete, so I will excuse the lack of a spoon for my linguine. I had two of the specials, romaine salad with goddess dressing and Nonna's Linguine with sausage. The edible flowers in the salad were pretty, but added little to the flavor of the overly peppery salad. The salad also needed a little moisture, or juice (maybe an heirloom tomato or cumcumber)? Nonna's Linguine (with sausage) had too many ingredients, however it was flavorful with perfectly cooked pasta. The ingredients taste fresh, and may be local (hence the name?). Overall a lovely dining experience, with a chef who is appears to take comfort foods on a creative trip.
June 8, 2013|Fantastic|5|We were pleasantly surprised at how nice this place was decorated, super comfortable. The hostess, waitress and busboy were all very friendly and the service was impeccable. The food was amazing with flavors I have never had before. You could tell everything was super fresh. We will be heading back to Local 121 soon. Thank you for making a great weekend even better!
June 7, 2013|This is where food s going|5|Farm to table. I don't think anything from this menu except maybe the salt comes from outside the new england area. This is the future of food and to go against the grain will ensure failure. The local cheeses. Beef and chicken frok acquidnick island. Local produce. It is all wonderful. Try the hand made caveitelli with confit egg. The menus change by what's available so go often. The chef is beyond talented. As an industry man, this place gets high marks as a place chefs love to eat.
June 5, 2013|Local 121 really wowed!|4|I've been here many times for lunch and really enjoy the wait staff, atmosphere and food. This was my first time for dinner and my swordfish, side veggies/quinoa were fantastic. We had company from out of town who commented it was the best swordfish he had ever had. Beautifully cooked and seasoned. My husband had one of the beef dishes which he said was delicious as well. I easily could have gone back the following night to have the very same meal.
June 3, 2013|Pasta dish was incredible|5|Pasta dish was incredible and my husband loved his cocktail, the little devil. Will absolutly be back!!
June 3, 2013|Really good|5|Great experience - delicious food, good service. Waitress was very helpful recommending dishes, portions were not too large, overall one of the best meals I've had in Rhode Island.
June 2, 2013|Great for pre theater|5|My famines favorite spot in Providence for pre theater with our daughter. Always great local ingredients.
June 1, 2013|Great food, elegant, yet cozy|4|Great food, elegant, yet cozy atmosphere. Our server was friendly and attentive. I am looking forward to coming back.
May 23, 2013|All around exceptional!|5|I took a colleague out to celebrate her new job. Our dishes were all distinctly flavorful and scrumptous: fiddle heads & ramps, mushroom leek tart, calamari was perfectly crisped-
May 18, 2013|Superb experience!|5|Truly a wonderful find!!! Service, cleanliness, ambiance, outstanding selection of food were all high on my list. There were 10 of us after a graduation which we all walked from the Dunkin Donuts Center. We were a little early but the bar had been open since 12 and could accommodate us until our table was set. The salads, small plates, entrees, desserts were all delicious and done to perfection. It was such a relief to have the total package for such a memorable occasion. Hats off to the chef, owner and wait staff!
May 18, 2013|We had a wonderful lunch and|4|We had a wonderful lunch and will definitely return.
May 17, 2013|Locally sourced prepared well|4|The menu was varied enough for all of my party to enjoy a selection that appealed to them. The perogies were fantastic and my rabbit ragu was outstanding. Service was good, but a bit forgetful. We had to ask 2x for several items, and my coffee refill did not come with cream. Overall we were impressed with the food, but slightly disappointed with the service
May 12, 2013|Amazing Find!|5|My wife and I went here for Mother's Day and loved the food...and I love food. Local 121 has some fresh, delicious, and eclectic choices. Their menu options are smaller, but it has a good mix of food types ranging from chicken and steak, to scallops, hake, and rabbit and what they do serve, they serve exceptionally well. We had an appetizer, two entrees, a bottle of organic Italian wine, and a dessert that cost $100. We go to pricier restaurants from time to time and are willing to spend the money if they deliver on the food, and Local 121 delivers in every way. The ambiance is great and very comfortable, and we happened to meet a celebrity that night to boot. Highly recommended!
May 12, 2013|Fit for Foodies|4|Wonderful food, relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, attentive service. We have eaten here twice recently. Both times the food was excellent. Excellent salads, both house and beet. Small plate mushroom tarte delicious. Bomster scallops perfectly done, nicely accompanied. Valrhona chocolate dessert delicious. The noise level was quiet to moderate depending on the day. In either case it was good enough for conversation.
May 12, 2013|Very nice Mother's Day|4|We really enjoyed our Mother's Day brunch at Local 121. Our adult sons were both able to find food to suit their palates and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our Eggs Benedict with locally cured ham. Service was very good - not rushed. Chairs were incredibly comfortable - a real plus. Tableware was very nice and the decor quite pleasing. Overall, a very positive experience.
May 12, 2013|The stuffed French toast was|3|The stuffed French toast was really tasty at brunch.
May 4, 2013|Great food|5|We had a visitor from out of town who wanted to try Local 121. We had a great experience. The asparagus plate was delicious. Portions were sized well and left room for dessert. I had the duck breast which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Our visitor had the scallops which he said were great. My husband and our other guest had the linguine with sausage which both praised. The desserts were also wonderful. All in all a very good evening out. The service was attentive but not over the top. The restaurant has comfortable chairs and a pleasant ambiance. We originally had a reservation for 8 pm booked through open table. This was a little late for our jet-lagged visitor but the restaurant were able to seat us earlier which was very helpful.
May 4, 2013|Overall delicious|5|We celebrated our Anniversary here ! Overall the food was very fresh, creative & delicious! would highly recommend the bean soup, scallops & ice cream terrine.
May 2, 2013|Perfect for after PPAC|4|Great spot for after the Theater. Great service. Loved the look of the place. Will be back.
April 26, 2013|Had a very nice experience|4|Had a very nice experience and look forward to going back. What a beautiful dining room they have. The service was excellent and the waiter was friendly and professional. Some of the food was overly salted.
April 26, 2013|Worth the trip|4|I have been wanting to dine here for over three years now. We live in Worcester but like to go to Prov. often. I had the best scallops I have ever eaten- perfectly cooked with a sweet and salty crust. I loved the citrus pieces cut into the potato puree- it was a pleasant tartness that made sense with the scallop and was unique with the starch. My husband had the duck breast and it was deliciously moist but not at all greasy. The portions were spot on- we are the majority of our meals feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed. My husband enjoys craft beers and though the list was small, he found a variety that suited his standards. I enjoyed the decor; it had a retro chic vibe that was both comfortably private and upscale.
April 19, 2013|Great local spot for good food|5|Food was good and service was great. We came early and had drinks at the bar first which was alot of fun. I had flank steak, she had scallops for dinner.
April 19, 2013|Great local find|4|Great local find! The food is very good, the service outstanding, and the atmosphere friendly.
April 17, 2013|Always great|4|As usual we had an excellent ,eal and service was wonderful. No negatives at all but bar/dining room can get loud.
April 16, 2013|Took our foodie daughter for|5|Took our foodie daughter for her 14th birthday and had a great night. All the food was delicious and the desserts put it over the top.
April 16, 2013|Sustaining Sustainably Great Meals|4|Local 121 continues to impress with a large selection of sustainably sourced local foods that make up a wonderfully diverse and tasty menu. I had the burger, which while a little more expensive than a comparable restaurants, was exceptionally well cooked and made for a great casual dinner. The Bumpster scallops are a must for anyone who enjoys fruits of the sea.
April 13, 2013|Local 121 - wow!|4|Local 121 is a real hidden gem in downtown Providence. Stepping into the restaurant feels like being transported back in time to an exclusive supper club. The downstairs bar mixes cocktails expertly and creatively. Service and food were quite good, duck entree really delicious, we saw our favorite Sonoma County Pinot on the wine list, a very small producer you see in restaurants only rarely, so that impressed us. Would go back gladly. Large party nearby was noisy until they left, after that the noise level was no issue.
April 9, 2013|Went there on a Tuesday night.|5|Went there on a Tuesday night. Very quiet. Lovely room - very upscale looking. Bar looked like a good place for a cocktail. We had three small plates and one entree. The calamari were very tender, the mushroon/leek tart very tasty and piping hot, and the mussels were excellent. The hanger steak was good with great frites. Very reasonably priced wine list. Will definitely return when visiting Providence.
April 6, 2013|This was an absolutely sensational|5|This was an absolutely sensational dining experience. I made a reservation here to celebrate a one year anniversary, and everything about the night exceeded my expectations. The food was delightful, light and tasty, and filled us up just the proper amount. The dessert was perhaps the best I have had in Providence; I would recommend the Ice Cream Terrine to anyone who likes pumpkin, and tell anyone else that they are wrong, and will love this dessert. This is a wonderful atmosphere for good conversation and a relaxing, romantic dinner.
April 6, 2013|After the reservation was great!|4|Everything about the food at Local 121 was excellent; the wait staff, the apps, main and dessert were all perfect. Only downside was the staff kept having issue with our reservation; calling 3 times to confirm the reservation; the last time about 40 minutes prior to our reservation. Seemed like they were either inept, confused, or they weren't too happy that our reservation came from Open Table. It almost ruined an otherwise wonderful meal.
April 6, 2013|Great value for money.|4|Food was very well presented, a little bit eclectic and very reasonably priced, particularly for a downtown Providence restaurant. The decor is upscale and with the valet parking would make an ideal place for pre-theatre dinner. Date night with the wife was a success again!!
April 5, 2013|I was in Providence for work|4|I was in Providence for work and Local 121 was recommended by a local friend and other conference attendees. The food was great and my server was friendly but not overbearing. I'd definitely go back.
April 2, 2013|We were a bit uncertain how|5|We were a bit uncertain how many we'd be after a function half an hour away, and also, were running later than planned. I called ahead and they were able to accommodate us even though we were late, and might have more than expected. When we arrived, we were seated at a wonderful round table with high backed booth bench--which meant we were intimate, even though there were six of us, making it easy to speak to each other. Service was great, food wonderful. We like Local 121 as a place to bring guests after university functions.
March 31, 2013|This was our favorite restaurant|3|This was our favorite restaurant in Downcity Providence. Our waitress never asked how the appetizer, main course, or dessert were. She never came by to pour the wine - not once. If my sister didn't flag down one of the other waitstaff for a steak knife, she would not have been able to eat her pork chop. She originally ordered short ribs(at 5:00 pm) only to be told they were out and it was last night's special. Robert Irvine would have something to say about that. The ice cream terrine could barely be cut. Overall, not an experience we'd like to have again. We were very disappointed.
March 31, 2013|Service was slow but friendly.|5|Service was slow but friendly. Best eggs benedict I've ever had.
March 31, 2013|A little overpriced, especially|3|A little overpriced, especially for a beet salad!!! Overall though, a good experience for brunch. Good food, but definitely not as great as the resident chef thought it was.
March 31, 2013|Attended for Easter Brunch.|5|Attended for Easter Brunch. Service was a little slow - it took us a while to place orders and get water for the table. Food was excellent. The menu had a good variety of options and lots of specials. We ordered a Monte Cristo special and a fritatta (both were very tasty) and a danish (a little dry but otherwise good.) Prices were quite reasonable, especially considering the quality and variety of what we received. I would definitely consider going again.
March 24, 2013|This was our second time there|5|This was our second time there and it didn't disappoint. The food was amazing, the atmosphere warm and inviting and the waitstaff friendly and talented. We don't get out for date night too often but when we're in Providence for a show (we were at PPAC for Lewis Black), Local 121 is our first choice!
March 22, 2013|We were there on a Friday|3|We were there on a Friday night and the floor was vibrating underneath our feet. Was it the pipes? Was it a band downstairs? It was distracting and uncomfortable.
March 15, 2013|What a marvelous restaurant!|5|What a marvelous restaurant! Hidden in plain sight in the hip part of Providence (just steps from Trinity Rep), this was an amazing meal made wiht great care, using impeccable ingredients. A small room, softly lit, with a great feel. Menu was interesting takes on great Rhody hits - there were clams with chorizo, scallops, beet salad - preparation and presentation were flawless. Food was delicious. Wine list very well done - nice wines by the glass, so you could pair with courses. Charming place to which we will happily return.
Dined on March 14, 2013|Great place to go on a date!|4|I've been to Local 121 a few times and it has always been great. The food is tasty and the waiters are super nice and accommodating. I don't care for the pillar in the middle of the dining area, but that's it. Also the chairs are huge and comfortable.
March 10, 2013|Food was fresh and delicious.|5|Food was fresh and delicious. I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked. Ambiance was pleasant, waitress pleasant.
March 8, 2013|Great meal and nice ambiance|4|This is the second time we've been. You've got to try the pierogies. The food was great. Service was great. Prices are reasonable. Dining at bar can be a bit noisy and crowded. Dining room much more quiet and relaxed. You won't be disappointed.
March 2, 2013|Was So Looking Forward But.....|2|Very attractive and warm space. We had reservations for 630 on Saturday night. We arrived on time and were seated at a nice table. We were given the menus as well as the separate menu of the day menu. We promptly ordered and then immediately were told that two of the 5 specials of the day were already sold out! At 630PM on a Saturday night, to be out of the night's specials.... not a good sign of things to come. The waitress was fair/average but, rather cold and robotic. We all ordered within minutes of being seated. Our salads (very small but, good) and soups (extremely small but also good) took 50 MInutes to arrive! (No Joke). Thereafter the entrees took quite a while after that to arrive. Very Slow Service/Cold Service/Good Food.
March 1, 2013|Adventerous Seasonal Eating|5|The seasonal menu at Local 121 includes unique combinations and seasonings of local foods. Our favorites include the deconstructed chicken pot pie, the rich short rib, and the scallops with mild Thai curry. Be sure to ask your server for advice as they are young, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. Local 121 is simply the best restaurant in Providence.
February 24, 2013|our brunch was delicious and|5|our brunch was delicious and service was excellent. there were four of us and we all had something different and were more than pleased with our meal. wine list was also great - je chardonnay fabulous. loved the refurbishment of the old building.
February 21, 2013|Met here for a business lunch;|4|Met here for a business lunch; excellent choices, lovely lemon-infused bottled water, and very good service including accomodating a request to turn a sandwich into a salad (greens substituted for bread).
February 19, 2013|Food and service impeccable!|5|My first trip to Local and it was delicious! I took a girlfriend that was visiting and I will definitely be back with my husband. We both had the bluefish pate on crostini and it was ah-mazing. I now crave it! (Note: large enough to share). For dinner we had the clam dinner and the fresh fish special, both which were delicious. The service was impeccable. Attentive but not annoying. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, but the noise was never too loud and we could easily carry on a conversation. The free valet was a really nice feature too - especially as it was raining that night. We popped our head in the bar area and that area also looked fun! Will be back soon!
February 16, 2013|Local 121 is one of Providence's|4|Local 121 is one of Providence's downcity cool-kids. They pride themselves on sourcing food locally and have established a consistent quality with a rotating menu. Game meats for meateaters, small-plates abound, plenty of vegetarian options, and a stellar, yet separate bar area which picks up later in the evening. The decor is classy yet comfortable and includes milky-smooth white leather seats. On the more expensive side, but truly a gem.
February 15, 2013|Exceptional|5|Everything was wonderful, the menu and specials made it hard to decide what to have and everything we tried was great, I can't wait to go back.
February 7, 2013|Terrific food and a great|5|Terrific food and a great vibe. Everything on the menu is tremendous.
February 5, 2013|They ran out of the pasta|4|They ran out of the pasta special but exchanged it for a different pasta, still very good. Had to wait too long between salads and main meal.
January 31, 2013|Met some friends there before|4|Met some friends there before a show in their speakeasy downstairs. Had a great dinner with all local foods ... from the fresh beet salad, to New England grass-fed beef and the special of the day was local flounder. We shared the desserts which were delicious as well. Wait staff friendly and personable without being personal. All good. Would definitely go again.
January 26, 2013|Wanted this to be fabulous|3|Wanted this to be fabulous but it missed the mark a little bit. We went during restaurant week - I had the prix fixe menu and my husband ordered off the regular menu. My main entree was mussels cooked in a porter sauce/broth - too heavy and too much flavor for the mussels. My husband had the duck which he enjoyed. In my opinion, the dishes could be simplified and would be better. Each dish listed on the menu had many, many ingredients - some conflicting flavors, I thought. Trying a little too hard, maybe. Service was great. Ambiance was fun and energetic. Tables were very close together. We will probably give it another try, but there are many more restaurants in PVD to try before going back.
January 25, 2013|I took my girlfriend to Local|4|I took my girlfriend to Local 121 for a dinner date and they had what we wanted, brought our food fairly quickly and the valet parking was a plus!
January 20, 2013|A great find in Providence!|5|A great find in Providence! We've been dying to try this place out for some time now, and it did not disappoint. The Blue fish pate was delicious to start, and our entrees (Chickn Confit pot pie and flank steak) were both perfect. Service was amazing from beginning to end. Another awesome thing to note was the ambiance! The hard wood with beautiful decor and small little detailed carvings around the walls, much of which we assumed was original to the building when it was the The Dreyfus hotel. LOVED IT!
January 20, 2013|The ambiance and the decor|2|The ambiance and the decor is very nice in this restaurant. We decided to try it because it is close to Trinity Theatre and boasted using local ingredients. Being foodies, local and fresh is important to us. The ingredients were fresh but the dishes we ordered were fair at best. They were over spiced and too many ingredients were used that didn't work together. One in our party enjoyed the Cod which was the simplest dish. Our group did enjoy the space; if I were to try it again I'd look carefully at the menu on line. There is a very nice bar on the other side of the restaurant which could be fun. I hate to give a bad review as there is much to appreciate about Local 121 but this time the food was disappointing.
January 19, 2013|Great food and atmosphere!|5|Great food and atmosphere! A must try. I will be returning very soon!
January 19, 2013|Food as always was excellent|3|Food as always was excellent as was the service. However, there was a very large party and the noise was extremely bad. We could barely carry on a con station on the opposite side of the dining room.

January 17, 2013|Great Find!!!!!!|5|i have been to Local 121 before..it never disappoints!!! the food, ambiance, waitstaff, etc... is great. i love the fact that the menu reflects local produce and seasonal items. i will definitely visit again!!!
January 15, 2013|This was a first time visit|5|This was a first time visit for one of my guests. Our meals were wonderful but the desserts were to die for. We had the pear bread pudding. Our waitress, Asha we attentive but not intrusive. We loved the restaurant decor. We definitely will be back.
January 12, 2013|I enjoyed my dining experience|4|I enjoyed my dining experience at Local 121. We had a birthday dinner there, it was the perfect way to celebrate. The staff was very attentive, the Manager Emily is very nice and the food was delicious!

December 31, 2012|We came here for New Year's|5|We came here for New Year's Eve from out of town and didn't know what to expect. We were completely amazed. The food was fantastic! My husband, who travels and dines in some of the best places in America, said it was one of the top ten meals in his whole life. I have a sweet tooth, and the desserts left a little to be desired, in my opinion, but were still great. Staff was very friendly. Great service. Try the rabbit sausage and lobster tail.

December 14, 2012|Overall a nice time. Food|4|Overall a nice time. Food was good, not great relative to price.
December 14, 2012|Elegant and a little different|4|My girlfriend and I visited Local 121 before seeing the Nutcraker at the PPAC. We were looking for something a litle special and this was it. I am not a wine expert, we had a bottle of Pinot Grigio/Catarrato, Purato 2011. It's organic and quite refreshing. The appetizer was Crispy Point Judith Calamari. And they were crispy and not heavilly breaded. The habernaro vinegret sauce is spicy without being overpowering. For the entre I had the Rabit Ragu, which was quite good, served over polenta. My girlfriend had the pan roasted scallops. She thought they were good but I thought they were burnt on the pan seared side. We didn't have desert. I thought the price for the meal was reasonable, espescially for a restaurant of this caliber.
December 9, 2012|Simply Wonderful|5|This is at least the fourth time we've been. You've got to try the pierogies. The food was great. Service usually is perfect - and was this time as well. Prices are reasonable. You won't be disappointed.
December 8, 2012|Great Experience|4|Really enjoyed our experience at Local 121. All around a solid performance. Food was quality, creative, locally sourced New American. Service was on the mark- but much more professional than friendly. My only suggestion would be to inject a little warmth in the otherwise perfectly executed experience.
December 6, 2012|Great way to experience Providence.|5|We were running late and Local 121 was very accomodating and kept our reservation. The ambiance was ovely albiet a bit loud and our table was not very private. The waitress was lovely and very helpful with wine and food choices. I had the chicken confit pot pie and it was delicious! My husband had the fluke and, that too, was very good.
December 6, 2012|We enjoyed our return to Local|5|We enjoyed our return to Local 121. Excellent service and a menu composed of Local ingredients..... I encourage all to enjoy Local 121. You'll want to return soon.

December 4, 2012|Had a very productive business|5|Had a very productive business lunch. The staff were helpful but not overbearing and showed up just at the right time. The food was outstanding. The bacon wrapped scallops was fantastic but could have benefited from a bit of an accompaniment (fries, salad). The signature drinks are also tasty with just the right amount of alcohol so as not to make you slur your words or fall asleep when you return to work; ) Good Value, wonderful taste, and great ambiance.

Dined on November 24, 2012|Solid.|3|"Like this place a lot. Food is very good, locally sourced, largely organic and well prepared. Three things to improve: servers (not waiters--the actual guys who bring the food are not very well trained), menu (keep the creativity but make it a bit more ""down to earth""), ambiance (place is always too cold--warming it up with higher heat, more ambient light and possibly some well placed carpet). A great evening out, but this could easily be the best restaurant in Providence. Maybe 2013 will bring a ""local 121 2.0""?"
November 24, 2012|Best $$ restaurant so far|5|"We had made reservations and were seated right away. The server immediately showed up with a bottle of chilled lemon water, and LEFT THE BOTTLE AT THE TABLE. She came back regularly to refill our glasses, and replace the bottle. OK so that was just the start. Fabulous green salads, delicious vinaigrette, and ""watermelon"" radishes (Google them, very cool) as garnish. Our dishes were prepared just as promised. Rare burger was indeed rare. Small pizza very tasty, had remains for lunch next day. All in all a great find in Providence. We'll be back."
November 24, 2012|Worth the wait|4|The food here is delicious and well-prepared- so be willing to waiT for it. We were there on Sturday night, which is their busiest night, but it still seemed a bit slow. I would definitely return on a slower night during the week.. Really great food.

She usually works Tuesdays, and this was a different evening. We enjoy 121, and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good meal at a wonderful restaurant, with great servers.
October 5, 2012|It's an ok place...|2|Service was not good, staff was nuce but everything took a very big time. Made reservations but it didn't seem like they even had them in their system.
October 5, 2012|Cool little joint|4|Great tasting food combined with good ambiance. Everything tasted wonderful and the prices were reasonable. Easy walking distance from most places in town. Only thing that was a bit odd was the time it took for us to get our food. Almost wondered if they forgot to put the order in. Once it arrived, very satisfied

October 3, 2012|great for business AND personal|5|Loved this place so much the first time when traveling alone on business that I took my husband here on his birthday. This time it was a business dinner with customers and they loved it as well. The wait staff is so passionate about the food. And as usual I found the perfect meal for a vegetarian. (One other at our party is vegetarian as well.) The cream of celeriac soup was amazing as was the vegetarian pasta special. And the coffee ice cream was the best I have ever had.
September 21, 2012|The food was very good for|4|The food was very good for this price point with a very comfortable atmosphere and very good service. The wine and drink list was extensive with full half and by the glass selections though not as many choices in the half bottle as I would have liked to see. Overall this moves up the list of places I would go when visitin providence.
September 19, 2012|Serendipity on a plate|5|Surprising pasta dish with an amazing mix of local, seasonal veggies in a sweet potato sauce that was perfect. I was worried it would be too filling, but the portion was ideal.... Well, except that I am still daydreaming about more 24 hours later :-)
September 12, 2012|Then restaurant is very nice|2|Then restaurant is very nice however, my friend ordered the fish of the day for dinner and it was less than two oz and it didn't come with any sides... we ended up eating at home again... but it was very tasty...
September 9, 2012|Great restaurant for local|4|Great restaurant for local food and a leisurely (but not slow) meal. Everything was very fresh and the portions were generous. Good choice for an occasion or pretheater meal.
September 8, 2012|The service was great and|2|The service was great and the restaurant lovely. The food had way too much going on. Too many flavors, to overpowering. Every course was unfortunately disappointing. I have been there in the past and have had hit or miss results. I would grab a drink at the bar, but I don't think I will be dining there any time soon.

September 6, 2012|First time dining in Providence,|4|First time dining in Providence, I did a lot of research for restaurants and Local 121 seemed like the best option for us. It was fabulous, everything fresh and local. It was our 20th anniversary, we did not have room for dessert, but they brought us 2 glasses of champagne on the house. Definately will return.
September 6, 2012|Very Satisfied!|5|Though we arrived half hour early for our reservation, we were welcomed warmly and seated immediately in the high-ceilinged, funkily chic dining room. The rest of the evening unfolded naturally from there. Our server paced things beautifully, and was never harried or hyper-friendly. The food was excellent, beginning with an amazing clam chowder. My garden vegetable pasta was light—a wonderful balance between the tomato and tiny basil leaves—and the pasta itself fresh and firm. My spouse's steak, ordered medium, was prepared exactly as requested in a generous portion. For our next visit we hope to have more time and will look more closely (with intent to consume) at the wine and dessert lists.
September 2, 2012|What a beautiful place. Great,|5|What a beautiful place. Great, old bar with a real bartender, real cocktails and when we moved to the restaurant, the food was amazing! Among the three of us, we had Scallops, Calamari, Pierogies, Clam Chowder, Bluefish Pate and Steamed Littlenecks. Everything was fabulous!

Their menu features locally and sustainably produced vegetables,meats, and cheeses. If you like what you find at our local farmer's markets, you will love what Chef Dave has created with them and served up at Local 121
August 17, 2012|A wonderful Surprise|5|This began as a simple evening out and turned into a meal that was full of wonderful surprises, from sea bass to scallops, bread pudding and wine. Our waitress, Kayla, was a marvel. As more guests came in the noise level increased but never to the extent of thinking one had to raise your voice to be heard. Dave Johnson is a great chef.

July 25, 2012|Outstanding!|5|We are delighted of our visit to Local 121, the food and service (Emma) were excellent, local products alre used throughout the menu which is a plus, the ambiance and decor are also very nice. A truly great experience!
July 21, 2012|It's not you, it's me|3|I'd been looking forward to a dinner at Local 121 for a while. And, while the food was enjoyable and the service excellent, I just didn't feel that special spark. Local 121, I really, really wanted for us to hit it off. All my friends said that we'd get along great. And you're pretty cool. You're tasty, smart, fun to hang out with. I mean, your mother obviously raised you right. You're the perfect gentleman, but I get the feeling that you're not that into me. And that's cool; I think I'd rather be friends anyway. Besides, I can tell that you're going to make somebody else very happy some day! So thanks for the nice night. Maybe I'll see you around some time.
July 19, 2012|local 121 utilizes seasonal|3|local 121 utilizes seasonal ingredients from local purveyors into their menu, giving the customer a sense of the restaurant's dedication to promote sensible cooking and dining. They have a good selection of beverages and food items, both of which taste delightful. However, the servers never introduced themselves to us and the food came out really slowly. I would definitely recommend checking local 121 out.
July 17, 2012|Our new #1 restaurant....|5|My guests and I adored every aspect of our visit -- the audacious and delicious tastes, the eclectically elegant surroundings, the traditional cool of the bar side and the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. That night there was a gorgeous crowd, too. Was it supermodel night?
July 14, 2012|Great Local Food, Amazing Brunch!!|4|This was our second time here which was not as good as the first which was Sunday Brunch. Our food this time was a bit under seasoned but good. SUNDAY BRUNCH is amazing and will be our next trip to this restaurant. The fact that they use mostly local food sources is an extreme plus and guarantees fresh seasonal food.
July 14, 2012|Food and service was Amazing.|3|Food and service was Amazing. Although for two people we were crammed in between two tables. Not very romantic. Servers were trying to squeeze in to wait on other couple right next to us. I understand them wanting to get as many tables in as possible, but one less table for two would be recommended. Food was amazing.
July 13, 2012|The food was absolutely delicious.|5|The food was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was friendly and provided excellent service. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. (Told a few people about it all ready). I am already planning my next visit back.

July 13, 2012|Not a busy night on a Friday|3|Not a busy night on a Friday in the summer during restaurant week, but was a good mix of people. Building and room very architecturally interesting. Server was nice and friendly. Fod was well prepared, not large portions but reasonable. Prices a bit high, free valet.

July 11, 2012|Really interesting interior|3|"Really interesting interior -- cozy seating, some banquettes, great for cold winter nights but a bit dark for summer evenings. Even though the restaurant was short-staffed, the waitress was efficient and attentive. The food was fine, but not as good as I'd expected from reviews. The peach melba dessert was a big disappointment -- it consisted of strawberry ""sorbet"" (we're fairly certain it was ice cream) and 3 slices of peaches, hardly warm and hardly cooked."
July 11, 2012|Gem with Ambience|4|Wonderful ambience, the decor is spectacular, very comfy leather chairs and the surroundings are beautiful. The cornmeal crusted fish was mediocre, but everything else on the menu was spectacular. Highly recommend the Thai duck wing appetizer, it's delectable and the chocolate cookie peanut butter sandwich for dessert - AMAZING!
July 10, 2012|Another great choice in Providence|4|Beautiful sophisticated dining room. hightlights local food, excellent service, varied menu choices, enjoyed restaurant week special prix fixe.

July 1, 2012|Went for brunch. Would have|4|Went for brunch. Would have liked a few more items on the menu. Split a french toast with our guest and it was just right. Other person's crab salad a little small for a main dish. Liked bottle of water on table (tap water), but would have been nice if ice offered since water was not very cold. Chocolate flourless cake outstanding.
June 30, 2012|The food was wonderful- Fresh|4|The food was wonderful- Fresh and flavorful! The fresh pea and mint crustini was different and tasted like summer. The scallops were perfect. The menu is creative and seasonal. The restaurant has a relaxed elegance, and would be perfect for a special occasion. Our party of four had a wonderful dinner and we will definitely return.

The tofu scramble was chock full of sundried tomatoes, spinach and snow peas and was very satisfying. The berry-stuffed french toast was perfectly done.
June 23, 2012|Local 121 was just as good|4|Local 121 was just as good as I had heard... the food was the best and I'll definitely go back.
June 21, 2012|I have had lunch and dinner|4|I have had lunch and dinner at Local 121 several times now. The food is always fresh and creative and the service is fabulous. I suggest having everyone at the table order something different and share as the menu is so varied and creative. Also, Local has the best cocktail menu in Providence. It is a particularly fabulous place to go for lunch; their lunch food is the same high quality as dinner, but two can eat and split a drink for 30 dollars. I would recommend Local to anyone visiting Providence and it has become one of my standbys for quality food and a good atmosphere.

The cocktail menu is creative and well-executed. The food is delicious and creative. I can't wait to go back.

May 30, 2012|Elegant room, attentive service,|5|Elegant room, attentive service, and excellent food. Loved the baby beet and baby arugula salad with hazelnuts, also the scallops wrapped in bacon. Interesting cocktails (fennel-infused vodka with blood orange juice and ginger, anyone?) and wine list. A lot of thought obviously goes into creating a fun, satisfying experience. Big emphasis on local ingredients.
May 27, 2012|Extraordinary fantastic dining|5|I highly recommend Local 121 as one of the best restaurants in America! It is definitely a superb restaurant fir any soecial iccassion!Outstanding fresh organic food!! The service was exquisite!! Fabulous servers and host! The staff was fantastic - professional yet warm and friendly! The food service was timed perfectly for our meal at a comfortable pace. The interior design/architecture creates one of the best dining environments we've experienced! Incredible interior design - with en vogue cutting edge creative elegance using white black & gold -nostalgic of the 1950's. It could have been in 'Mad Men' as a glam speakeasy ! Don't miss an opportunity to dine here! Very reasonably priced with a la carte as well as a prix fixed menu.
May 26, 2012|Tapas, tapas, tapas|4|Food...great!, Service... fantastic! great location, tapas are the way to go. However, the yrefused to open my bottle of wine which I had hauled all the way from California to celebrate the graduation of my daughter. That was a bummer....
May 26, 2012|While the surroundings and|3|While the surroundings and food presentation were great, the food itself wasn't hot enough. I ordered their catch of the day, which was hard and a bit tasteless. The littlenecks and lobster were very good though. We had also requested that the clam chowder come without bacon, and the server came with chowder that had bacon in it. We had to point out the mistake, but they were gracious in sending it back and getting a new bowl.
May 24, 2012|So-so and not worth the money.|3|I'd heard really great things about this restaurant, so I took my husband there with our two daughters for his birthday dinner. None of us were impressed. The food was uninspired and bland, and while the atmosphere was pleasant, it wasn't particularly memorable. I also thought the meal was way overpriced. I'll stick with Mills Tavern or Al Forno for future special occasions.
May 20, 2012|I did not even get to go.|1|I did not even get to go. They were so rude on the phone with me when I called ahead of time to tell them I had another person to add to my party. They said they simply could not accommodate us and said no! So I had to take my friends from out of town to Newport!
May 19, 2012|I had been to Local 121 in|5|I had been to Local 121 in the past but never for Dinner. When I had gone in the past I had to gone to meet friends for Drinks and to listen to the late night music. My Boyfriend and I went to go celebrate a special event here on Saturday night. e were hoping for a nice romantic dinner, and that is what we got. The food was incredible, the service was par none. We started out by sitting at the bar where Nate took care of us. We know Nate from other Bars and Restaurants he has worked at in the area and he has always been great, but he really seemed to be in his element behind this bar at 121. We then Moved on to dinner which was incredible. In short, everything was perfect, and we will definitely be back with our friends and family.
May 19, 2012|Good. Not great.|3|Good but not great. Kind of pricey = $150 for two, with a bottle of wine and dessert. The food was fresh and inventive - I had an asparagus tart with homemade goat-ricotta as an appetizer, which is not something you see on a menu everyday. It was incredibly good. All in all, the menu was interesting and creative, and this is something that I appreciate in a restaurant, in that I want to select things that I would ordinarily never eat at home. Local 121 fills the bill there. Our server, although quite pleasant, never offered us her name and brought us our check without having asked if we'd like anything else. I was a little surprised that she was not more professional. She, like the food, was good but not great.
May 12, 2012|Going Local is Good!|4|Very enjoyable - good food - and nice atmosphere we will definitely go back!
May 10, 2012|Lunch at Local|4|This was a very successful business lunch. We did have to ask for the music to be turned down but otherwise everything was excellent. Always save room for dessert! Baked Rhode Island, YUM.

May 4, 2012|Good food, well seasoned.|3|Good food, well seasoned. Comfortable dark wood room. Service a bit uneven. Willing but not very professional. It took several minutes of standing by the door for anyone to greet us; it took a similar number of minutes to request and be given the check -- but the waitress was pleasant and accommodating. A good experience, but not a great one.
May 2, 2012|my only negative was that|5|my only negative was that the bottle of wine - a pinot can't remember the name - had gone partially bad. 2008 pinots should be thrown away, fyi that said, love the restaurant and the waitress was as always great
April 29, 2012|I was disappointed with the|2|I was disappointed with the meal and the service was quite poor. We were missing spoons before and after the coffee was served, and had to request them. Staff did not circulate the tables frequently. My beet salad for brunch was not a meal, though the price and menu placement suggested it would be. There were no greens, the baby beets themselves - of several varieties and colors - were beautiful and well prepared but with just a bit of sauce and garnish on the plate was just a whetting of the appetite. I shared some of my husband's omelet and a bite of a friend's past so that I wouldn't leave hungry.
April 28, 2012|We went to this restaurant|5|We went to this restaurant before attending a play. The waitress made sure our food arrived on time, without making the meal feel rushed. We love the decor of this restaurant - once the lobby of an old hotel. And the food is local - and quite fresh!
April 26, 2012|Completely impressed with|5|Completely impressed with the friendliness of the staff. I grew quite fond of their food and drink list as well.
April 22, 2012|Local 121 is a beautiful environmen|4|"Local 121 is a beautiful environment for dinner. Four of us visited before a play, and we tried the pre-theater prix-fixe menu. The service was excellent, and all of the food was tasty, but dessert was a real standout. Be sure to try the house-made ice cream, especially if ""cinnamon toast crunch"" is on the menu."
April 22, 2012|Excellent kitchen. Service|2|Excellent kitchen. Service slow and not very attentive - no bread offered during long wait for entrees; had to ask for coffee.
April 21, 2012|Specialty cocktails a hit|4|Specialty cocktails a hit on a cool damp spring evening. The white Manhattan and Italian Sangria were delicious. Four of us for dinner with one having severe allergies. The waiter and chef were beyond accommodating in choosing just the right dishes for her. The other three of us shared the house made charcuterie platter for our appetizer, followed by a duck and gnudi dish and a pasta with asparagus and spring ramp dish. A twist on desserts lead us to choose Rhode Island Alaska and the rhubarb tart. We'll definitely return.
April 21, 2012|I made an online reservation|4|I made an online reservation for pre-theater (matinee) lunch. Three of our party, seniors over 80, arrived in town an hour ahead of our reservation but wanted to try to get seated early. The hostess graciously welcomed us and sat us immediately. Understanding that she had just seated a large party (more than 10), were patient about a slightly-delayed ordering time. We were immediately furnished with lemon water (a full bottle plus glasses for all) and bread. Two of our party arrived a bit later because we were parking the vehicle at a lot rather than getting milked by 25-cent-per-quarter-hour meters that ARE active on Saturdays (thanks to the waitress for checking!!). The menu had something appealing for all and food was EXCELLENT.
April 18, 2012|Very disappointing!!! Food|1|Very disappointing!!! Food was so bland and tasteless that I wish I had gone to McDonald's instead! Four of us had four different entrees, and all of them were equally awful. Appetizer was previously frozen, out of the box calamari. Really? I had the burger; the only thing I tasted was the red onion. I had to resort to the salt shaker for flavor. Come on! My wife had the braised beef on a cauliflower puree. Nothing! No nada. No flavor at all. Hello? How about some herbs, some garlic, some red wine reduction. My son had the Hanger steak; how do you make that tasteless and bland? His girlfriend had pasta. You got it; no flavor at all. It is too bad. The space is beautiful and the waitstaff friendly and competent. Solution? Replace the chef
April 14, 2012|Loved everything about Local|5|Loved everything about Local 121. Food is clean, fresh and deicious. Decor is terrific- classic, service is attentive yet relaxed, valet parking is a real plus in the downtown area. Highly recommend!
Dined on April 14, 2012|Average|3|My friends and I scheduled an early dinner so we could eat before catching a show at the Performing Arts Center. We made a reservation, were seated relatively quickly, and then the looooong wait began -- a long wait before our server arrived, another long wait for drinks, food, etc. In their defense, it was bustling in there and I'm sure a lot of other patrons were there early to eat before the show, too, but there's no excuse for average service, average food, and a strangely long wait to receive both.
April 10, 2012|The food was good, our server|4|The food was good, our server was wonderful and kind. All the seatings are a little bit too close. We sat by a group of noisy celebrators, so it wasn't very intimate or romantic, but i think it could be if the seating is right. good prix-fixe $30 three courses. Relatively cheap for quantity and quality.
April 8, 2012|The food was interesting,|5|The food was interesting, innovative and delicious and just the right portions - not too small, not huge. The service was truly remarkable. Our server was friendly, attentive (but not hovering) available - really a delight. Love this restaurant.
April 1, 2012|Local 121 Is a Local Gem|5|My wife and I went to Local 121 on a Sunday evening to celebrate her birthday. The restaurant was busy but not packed, and we were seated immediately. Service was attentive and well-informed. Our food choices included a beet and hazelnut salad, the daily mixed vegetables, duck polpettes with ricotta dumplings, and pan-seared bass, all of which were delicious. My wife also had a creme brulee for dessert, which she thought was one of the best she's ever had. Overall a great experience!

March 24, 2012|Exquisite customer service.|4|Valet is always polite. When we walked in we were greeted by the hostess who sat us at our table and politely wished us Happy Anninversary with a smile. Kayla was our server and she was lovely. She added such a touch of class to the meal. She was polite, soft spoken but very knowledgable, and smiled with her heart as if she really enjoyed her job. Not seen much any more these days. The food was terrific as always. The restaurant is so beautiful. But this time the service made the meal.
March 23, 2012|Overall, the food was WAY|3|"Overall, the food was WAY too salty. My girlfriend let me try her littlenecks and the only thing I could taste was salt. Our waitress explained that this was out of the cook's control (""because the clams are from the ocean""... ?) We didn't pursue the matter any further. Our waitress was at least gracious enough to offer my girlfriend another choice off the menu - the steak tartar. The presentation of the dish was really lacking. The steak tartar was presented in the shape of a raw hamburger patty. Slightly unappealing. I've frequented the bar at Local 121 regularly for just over a year and have really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the drink menu is top-notch. The dining experience was however a disappointment."
March 15, 2012|Excellent!|5|This is a gem in the neighborhood. The menu is constantly updated to reflect seasonal offerings and is always delicious. I have never had anything that was not outstanding at Local 121. Not to mention, they have the friendliest staff around and a gorgeous bar reminiscent of Great Gatsby! They offer the same menu at the bar and great drinks.

February 20, 2012|Service team not a team.|3|"The service team does not work as a team. The restaurant was not crowded when we got there. We ordered wine which did not come until we were finished with our dinner. The waitress was more than apologetic and offered the wine as complimentary. We declinded the wine because we were finished eating by the time it came. The restaurant was not crowded. The waitress threw her bar tender under the bus saying that,""there were too many complicated mixed drink offerings."" The bus boy spent most of his time chatting with the hostess. He didn't even have to bring water to the table because the restaurant provides a bottle for the table. The food was delicious. The dessert which was three scoops of house made ice cream was scrumptious."

February 18, 2012|Great food and ambiance|5|"Loved dining at Local 121. The food was delicious (scallops, pasta, meatloaf, and especially the baked Rhode Island for dessert). I love the atmosphere - very cool, swanky, unexpected. I can't wait to go back. The service is okay - very friendly and polite, just not that high end ""pampered"" feel - but the price is very affordable, so I can't complain. The only thing the service lacked was being attentive and prompt - everything else was perfect and very pleasant. It just seems like it should be better for how good the food is and how nice the atmosphere is. But it is a total bargain too! We couldn't believe our check was only $90 after one app, two entrees, a dessert, and two glasses of wine. Terrific value for a high end experience. LOVED!"

February 14, 2012|I will totally go again|4|"My boyfriend and I wanted to find a new cute place to go out and have a nice dinner. The food was excellent and the drinks were delicious! I thought the tables were awkwardly high so drinking from the rather tall wine glass I had made me nervous haha. I would definitely go again, and I hope to take my parents there next week! It's not cheap, so I wouldn't consider it a ""hang out."" I would definitly go back just to try a few more of their mixed beverages. I would reccomend this for a great date."
February 14, 2012|I haven't been to Local 121|4|"I haven't been to Local 121 in quite a while, but after our Valentine's Day dinner, it reminded me why I need to spend more time downtown. The dinner was fantastic, service was very good. I wish the server had a bit more personal involvement in the menu (when asked for recommendations, he just repeated that ""Everything is excellent""), but he was very pleasant and didn't overwhelm us with intrusion. I discovered a new favorite wine (Four Bears) and my date's scallops/smoked mussels will have me coming back soon! Overall, we had a very nice time and the hostess was also quite friendly and remembered which coat was my date's when she couldn't locate her coat check ticket - nice touch!"
February 13, 2012|since this is a LOCAL place,|4|since this is a LOCAL place, it is about the foods that are in season, so you really need to know what kind of local 'grub' is in season, to see if you would like. The vegetable for the evening was purple cabbage. Would have been nice to have something common, like broccoli, but it is all about eating local and what is in season - so just remember that!

Noted that we would be dining prior to Theater on Open Table reservation. We were seated promptly and also informed server that we were dining prior to Theater. Everything was going find actually finished dinner a 7pm. Order coffee and expresso. Coffee didn't arrive until 20 minutes later and had to cancel to get to show. Disappointed in slow service especially when making a point to share after dinner plans. Other that that experience was good but the delay caused to spoil the evening.

The sides were unimaginative for the most part. Our coffees and latte were lukewarm. It should be a gold mine as it is close to PPAC, Trinity, and the Dunkin' Donut Center.
January 6, 2012|We Loved It|5|We had a fabulous dinner here. We arrived to town late and the location was perfect - less than a block from our hotel. We had a wonderful table in a quiet corner, and enjoyed a superb meal.

December 31, 2011|Superb meal on New Year's Eve.|5|We attended dinner as part of our own Bright Night celebration. One of our party is a vegetarian with special food requirements. The chef made delicious vegetarian dishes and all of us thoroughly enjoyed each course of our prix fixe dinner (and dessert). This was one of the best meals we've had in a long time. We eat out quite a bit and get pretty tired of eating mediocre meals. This was superb. Music choice and service also outstanding. Thank you for making our New Year's Eve special!

November 16, 2011|Great time was had by all|5|I have had two wonderful birthday dinners at Local 121. Both times the service was great well paced and attentive without being overbearing. The food is locally sourced so always fresh,very flavorful and original. The wine by the glass list is short but the bottle list is more extensive and well rounded. The atmosphere is comfortable and elegant in the dining room and a little funky and fun in the bar area, but not loud. Always a joy.
November 15, 2011|Amazing dinner with our daughter!|5|What a great find. We brought our 4 year old daughter for a pre-theater dinner. Everything sounded so good it was very hard to decide. My husband and I split a bunch of appetizers. Chicken liver, calamari and the pierogis were amazing. My daughters hamburger and fries also outstanding. Service so friendly and may seem silly but THE most comfortable chairs ever! Definitly our new go to place before PPAC events.

The menu is always changing but never disappoints. Almost every dish has some imaginative twist and presentation is excellent--but the creativity doesn't get in the way--you still know what is at the heart of each dish.
November 12, 2011|Abolutely beautiful dining|5|Abolutely beautiful dining area and bar, with turn of the century architecual details of carved wood and plaster, tasteful furniture. The ambiance is superior. Food is also excellent, mostly concentrating on local sourced food (hence the name of the restaurant). Service was good and professional. Not a big bar or restaurant, so reserve on open table early.

November 1, 2011|An off night?|2|I have been to Local 121 about 4 or 5 times, but they were off their game last night. We brought some friends with us to dine before Trinity, and were disappointed and embarrassed because we had sang the praises of this local eatery for so long! The service was a bit off, there was no hostess, both woman ordered grass-fed burgers, hers (medium) and mine (med/rare)...both came overdone, cheese, mushrooms, and onions were noted as add-on, and charged! No, we did not send them back because of time restraints. My husband ordered the cod, he received two very small pieces of fish. The four of us ordered two desserts to share, the choc. bread pudding, and apple tart...both disappointing, not much flavor in either.

October 23, 2011|Bravura Dining Experience|5|We continue to choose this restaurant for its focus on local foods, outstanding preparations, lovely surroundings, quiet atmosphere that allows conversation, wonderful service and proximity to Trinity....which is one of the few times we eat out. SOOO happy to have this as a dining option...can't praise it enough....food is terrific!

October 16, 2011|I think I had a different|3|I think I had a different vision of this restaurant being from ou of town, more of a hip, homey farm to table restaurant. At 10 AM we were the first Sunday brunch dinners. I had made a reservation because of Parent's weekend and homecoming at Brown so we'd have a table. Open Table had an opening for 5 at 10 o'clock but not at 10:30 so we reserved the 10 o'clock table. Took a bit for the the wait staff to get moving, it felt as that they had just gotten there. The food was delicious, although a bit pricey for breakfast. There was only one other table until practically the time we left. The restaurant has an elegant vibe more suitable for night dining.

October 7, 2011|Downtown spot with character|4|Recommended by our hotel, this spot had a very nice ambiance, capable kitchen and good service. Half of our meal was outstanding- my appetizer (oysters) and my husband's main course (swordfish with littlenecks special); the other two sevings were good but not great.

October 1, 2011|Local IS better!|5|"We had been wanting to try Local 121 for sometime and we're glad we did. All of the locally sourced food really does add to the flavor. I was a sceptic of the whole ""everything local"" movement, but it really does make a difference you can taste!"

September 30, 2011|We had read reviews of this|2|"We had read reviews of this restaurant in Tripadvisor. There were mostly great ones, and a couple that were poor. We were one of the unlucky ones. My daughter's steak was raw, green beans were several temperatures and inedibly garlicky, and fries were soggy. The waitress was lovely, but we had some difficulty with the manager when we wanted this dreadful meal taken off our bill. My husband's steamed littlenecks were just ""Ok"" and my tagine with undercooked vegetables was saved by the spices. If you read our reviews, we are not complainers, but this restaurant sorely disappointed."
September 23, 2011|Overall, this was a great|5|Overall, this was a great meal. I'm definitely bringing out-of-town guests when they visit. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was amazing - very friendly. At times, the service was a little fast, but we did not feel rushed at all. That shouldn't stop anyone from going though. I strong recommend Local 121!

September 19, 2011|This is a fine restaurant|4|This is a fine restaurant that sources as much as it can locally. My server was very helpful in discussing the menu. I had two small plates: bacon wrapped scallops with shaved pickled red onion and celery in a sherry vinaigrette -- MUCH better than the description might suggest. Then clam and chorizo fritters with saffron lemon aioli and house slaw -- the fritters very light and flavorful. The rest of the menu, small plates and large, all looked worth trying. I'd come back here in an instant.
September 17, 2011|Local 121 was recommended|5|Local 121 was recommended to me by a Providence local and did not disappoint. This place would fit in just as well in Chicago or NYC as it does Providence. Excellent locally sourced cuisine, creative details, and attentive, friendly service. Great for special occasions or an impromptu dinner. Formal but not condescending feel to the room with plenty of nice touches. Check it out!!!

Only comment is that Open Table does not allow for reservations for more than 6 people. I had to call the restaurant to make a reservation for 9.

As a cook, I love to find spots that cherish and emphasize the taste of real food, what it should really be, and they do it. The atmosphere is excellent, the servers are fun and professional and make you feel comfortable and glad you chose to come here. With everything local and sustainable, using only what is in season, they either make it in house or come as close as possible. Anyone looking for a good time and great food in Providence should make a trip to Local 121.

Dined on July 22, 2011|Unicorn Detail Lovin'|5|I have been wanting to visit Local 121 for a while, and when Restaurant Week came around, I finally did! It most definitely did not dissapoint, the food was exquisite in taste and plating, and had unique details in each dish that made the dishes memorable. The fact that all of the food is locally grown was also a favorite part of the experience! I drank a Unicorn, which is a secret Local 121 recipe that has champagne, and can say that the drink alone would be worth returning for, even if the food hadn't been as incredible as it was.

Low key but high quality service. I live in NYC and I would seriously consider finding a reason to go to providence so I could eat here again. A real winner. Beautiful space.
July 18, 2011|A wonderful experience!|5|What a great find! The food was wonderful and the service was too! I found this gem by accident and will make it a frequent stop whenever in Providence. Our server was attentive yet not intrusive. We had the clams and scallops which were perfectly prepared. The baked Rhode Island was awesome.
July 18, 2011|Walk by surprise|5|The promise of local and fresh food was more than met in all the dishes prepared. The staff was very friendly and upbeat. I have lived in Providence for a couple of years now, going out once or twice a week and never heard of this place. Now it will be a regular venue for me and my friends.

July 9, 2011|Worth a visit... or ten|5|I always enjoy every visit to Local 121, whether I'm going for lunch, dinner, drinks or dancing. The staff there is friendly, accommodating, knowledgable and very down to earth. The space is designed well, with great lighting, beautiful decor and comfortable seating. It's managed well, reasonably priced, and the food (which is locally bought) is absolutely delectable. When I can't decide what to choose, I close my eyes, bring my finger down on the menu and order whatever it lands on. It's never disappointed- very interesting culinary combinations that are surprisingly delicious. The taproom has beautiful woodwork and stained glass windows, definitely a gem of Providence.

June 24, 2011|A special place|5|Local 121 is one of the real standouts in a city that doesn't lack for excellent restaurants. The menu is varied; the food is delicious, and tastefully presented; the service is first-rate; and the prices are reasonable. The ambiance is quietly sophisticated. An outstanding choice for a special occasion, or to make any occasion a little special.
June 24, 2011|Loved that this restaurant|4|Loved that this restaurant proudly serves and identifies all the local places that supply their Rhode Island products. The food was delicious, the wait staff attentive but not hovering, and a meal worth remembering was enjoyed. So glad that other Trinity Rep subscribers shared information about Local 121 with me. I look forward to bringing my daughter there when we attend one of Trinity's next season productions. Another Providence gem of a restaurant is now one of my favorites.

It is evident that a lot of thought has gone into the menus. Everything we ate was delicious, perfectly prepared, adjusted to our needs. The service was attentive and enthusiastic. I can't wait to go back.

June 15, 2011|I have eaten there twice and|5|I have eaten there twice and everything we ordered was outstanding. The reliance on local ingredients places no limits on the variety on the menu. In fact, I was blown away by some of the unique ingredients in some dishes (never heard of a sunchoke before!). Service was superb and ambiance is very special. And it is a block from the Trinity Rep Theater, making it a great pre- or post-theater choice.

May 15, 2011|Always fresh, new and exciting|5|"This was our second visit to Local 121 in as many weeks...and probably our 4th or 5th in the past several years. We love the fresh, local food...offerings are always new and intriguing...never the ""usual suspects"" as in other restaurants. We enjoyed everything from appetizers, to soups, salads and entrees....have NEVER been disappointed. Decor is quiet and soothing, service excellent"
May 14, 2011|Great decor. Chairs and big|3|Great decor. Chairs and big and bulky. Sink down too low and make you feel like you are reaching for the table. Great cocktails. I had terrible service on 5/14/11. But other times have been fine. The valet was a little lack luster as well. Food was great, but the poor service overshadowed the food. The waiter never checked back with us, we tries to flag him down, but he just walked by. We had to get another server to get him for us.
May 14, 2011|Delicious and Fresh|4|We had an excellent meal at Local 121. Six if us dined and all meals were delicious. I had the Pan Roasted Bomster Scallops. They were delicious and the most tender and fresh I've ever had. Someone else had the the Tenderloin and Lobster tail special. Also excellent but they only gave you 1/2 the lobster tail, and for the price was rather chintzy. We loved the ambiance, service was excellent. My only complaint was the portion size for the price. When you added up the appetizer (which I would recommend since dinner is rather small), dinner and desert it is very expensive meal. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion and very convenient to the Trinity Repertory Theater.
May 13, 2011|It's ok, you'll do better next time|2|We had a reservation for 5 at 8:00 PM on a Friday, the restaurant wasn't too busy but, we waited about 30 mins. before being sat at our table(no big deal these things happen). The service was ok but, there was a 45 minute interval between our appetizers and entrees. When the entrees did finally arrive, two dishes were lukewarm and the last came out a noticeable 5 mins. later piping hot. One of our guests returned her cold duck, the other just ate it because she was tired of waiting. When, her entree finally made its way back to our table it was overdone and cold,and every one else had finished there dinner. Most of my guests have worked in the industry before so, we didn't want to make a big fuss. The food was good but, the timing was off.

We'll be back!

The duck confit with sweet potato hash was outstanding! Everything on the menu looked great - can't wait to go back to try something else.
April 21, 2011|Could have been handled differently|4|The restaurant has a thoughtful wine list and changing menu using mostly local ingredients and purveyors. The hostess and waitstaff are friendly and knowledgable. The Valet departs by 10PM and no one tells you this until you give up waiting for your car and return back into the restaurant. Our keys were at the bar, told to us by someone who would never had been picked out as a manager. When we got our car keys, the house keys were GONE!! There was no reason for this, they don't easily detach. What began as a enjoyable evening out with friends became a hassle. We had to find our house keys! The manager continued to not only be unprofessional but, judgmental about our concern and in final, unapologetic. Find your own parking!!
April 21, 2011|New comer's to Providence|5|My husband & I had to best experience at the Local 121! It was our first time in Providence and all the other places we had dinner before this were awful. I especially loved the restuarants decor and we look forward to going back there. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious!
April 17, 2011|Amazing food, almost-there service|4|Always enjoy my meal at Local 121... however even when the restaurant isn't busy, the service is a bit sluggish. (Not that I'm in favor of a rushed chain restaurant style dining experience, but 10 minutes between being shown to your seat and having your drink orders taken is a bit much.) Luckily the food makes it worth it and with a bit more attentiveness, this would leave little to be desired!
April 17, 2011|We had a pleasant pre- theater|3|We had a pleasant pre- theater experience but I was a bit disappointed with my dinner. My husbands choices were fantastic- calamari app and flatiron steak. My soup was ordinary and so were the chicken Polpetti (meatballs) and mushroom ravioli. The ravioli dough was too thick and simply or enough flavor. When I dine out I like to be impressed with food that is better Thani can make at home. But like I said, my husbands food was great so maybe it was just my bad luck. Service was great and the ambience is lovely.

We choose to go there for the food is provided by local producers. All the meals we have had there are mouth watering, very flavorful and cooked precisely right. The ambiance was very light and definitely a place to be able to have a great conversation while absorbing the atmosphere of the place in a timeless setting. Everything was great there. My mom and I had a great time and look forward to our next visit.

I loved the polenta appetizer and my Arctic Char entree was the best entree of the night. Such great flavors in both dishes. Our server was great too - very knowledgeable and helpful - let us know about free valet when a friend was trying to figure out where to park and said she would stamp our ticket for free parking in the garage, even though we were heading to a concert afterwards. I am a major foodie and would definitely go back to Local 121.

This was the best meal we've enjoyed out in many months, and we'll definitely be back here!

We didn't order from it, as the regular menu was more interesting. I recommend the yellow beet salad and the scallops and the horseradish crusted artic char. The service was leisurely, so if you are in a hurry be sure to tell them. The food was fresh and delicious.

March 22, 2011|Special Birthday was perfect!|5|We were celebrating a very special birthday. It was a bit of a surprise. Everyone from the valet, the hostess Sophie, and waitress Asha, were just wonderful. The valet guy had a great sense of humor and was so friendly and accomodating. Sophie, the hostess, paid attention to every detail I requested. We were blending two families for the first time and they made it so much fun. The waitress knew the details of the menu to a T. The food was amzing as always. The entire night was a wonderful first memory for us to build on.

Is there a new chef? everything was first rate: wine, service, but particularly the flavors - we all 4 ate something different and each was an actual gem of its own. that is pretty rare. In an era where higher end restaurants just load on butter and call themselves, ""fine dining,"" Local 121 was a standout. kudos to Josh Miller and team.."

March 10, 2011|A very local upscale restaurant|4|A very local upscale restaurant that supports not only local food sources but the art scene as well. Great (easy walk)location to the major hotels in downtown Providence. The staff is friendly and attentive, with good suggestions and input. On the downside, I think the waiters could serve the food and remain a part of the dining experience, but like most restaurants today, the food is brought by an unexpected third party who is not interested in the dining experience. This is not only an unnecessary role, but also insensitive to the patron/waiter relationship, the noise level is a bit loud, and middle of the room table locations are not very conducive to pleasant dining. Otherwise, a great ambiance in an old well loved Providence landmark.

I am looking forward to going back there.

February 27, 2011|You won't be disappointed ...|4|Sunday night dinner was busy, not crowded. Seated and greeted, service was friendly, accurate and timely. Food was very good, on the pricier side. A couple of vegetarian plates were on the menu. Servings were right sized and presented well. Ambiance of the place is somewhat dark and subdued, chairs were slightly too low for the table ... my only complaint really ... not trendy inside at all. I have eaten in the bar in the past which is in a side room ... good place to meet friends .. good bar, lively enough, but you can sit and talk too.
February 26, 2011|Could have been very good, but...|3|We were looking forward to this meal and had wanted to try this place for a while. Service was a little slow and two of our courses arrived at the same time (which is unacceptable, especially at places like this). They mentioned that it was because they had several large parties, but that is not an excuse as they had accepted our reservation so should have been able to handle this. When the food came, there was either a hard piece in the calamari. This appeared to be improperly cleaned or a piece of plastic. No effort was made to make up for this. Several of the items were also over salted which took away from otherwise delicious flavor and texture combinations. I would like to give them another try as I hope these issues were a one time

February 19, 2011|We chose this restaurant for|4|We chose this restaurant for its commitment to local and sustainable practices. From the small plates we ordered calamari, pizza, and the sardines, a special that evening. We had two large plates, the Arctic char and roast chicken. We had a Baked Rhode Island for dessert. Everything was good; nothing was memorable. Service was friendly and professional, and dinner was perfectly timed and relaxed.
February 18, 2011|Overall our group was pleased|3|Overall our group was pleased with their experience at Local 121. We appreciated the focus on locally-raised, sustainable ingredients. And, for the most part the dishes were well-executed. The restaurant appeared understaffed for the number of tables/diners. Consequently, the service was slow and not the level of attentiveness for the prices charged. Additionally, the decor and music are not paired well with the cuisine (50's-60's decor/music, with 21st century cuisine). Get some new speakers b/c the music sounded tinny and that can be really annoying for those who are now used to very high quality of sound.

February 15, 2011|Gem in Downtown Providence|5|Once again, I cannot speak too highly of Local 121. It is a true gem in downtown Providence. My husband and I had a leisurely dinner before going to the theatre, by the way, is only a block away! How convenient. The food and service was outstanding. We started off sharing a polenta appetizer that was lightly flavored with lemon zest, fresh arugula, roasted mushrooms and squash and a delicious dressing! My husband had a homemade pasta dish with sausage and I had a delightful spicy shrimp atop creamy grits, spinach and yes, a soft-boiled egg. The coffee was robust and the homemade sorbet and ice-cream with a homemade cookie was the perfect ending. You will not be disappointed by dining at this beautiful appointed restaurant.

The only complaint I have is that it was impossible to get a real person on the phone to confirm the reservation. Every time I called it would take me through prerecorded machines and no one would ever answer the phone. Otherwise, a great experience and I would certainly recommend it!
February 14, 2011|Yum!|5|Local 121 was great! I had the sweet potato crostada and it was a delicious vegetarian meal. My date had the flank steak and said it was fantastic! The best part was the dessert...Baked Rhode Island...delicious! The only negative was that when we ordered dessert they were out of most every option except the Baked Rhode Island. Luckily, it ended up being very good. Very romantic atmosphere for our Valentine's Day dinner. Highly recommended.
February 12, 2011|Amazing!|5|My girlfriend has been dying to try Local 121. So I decided to take her there for our valentine's day dinner. Great food in a great atmosphere and the service was great. Loved the overall feel of the place with some great background music that really added to the night. And the free valet was a godsend since the Providence streets are in horrible shape due to all the snow. I plan on returning to Local 121 often.

February 5, 2011|We had to change our reservation;|5|We had to change our reservation; the receptionist was helpful and calm. We talked long during our meal; the sound level was good (not too loud), and waitstaff were distantly watchful and appeared on cue. The locally-grown food was imaginatively prepared and presented. Dessert was abundant and delicious. Best of all, the check was presented immediately upon removal of dessert plates! Highly recommend this good local restaurant.
January 29, 2011|Another gem in Providence|5|My husband and I will add this to our list of regularly visited restaurants in Providence. Every dish we had was fabulous -- the tomato soup (I really want the recipe) the haddock (my entree), the pappardelle and sausage (my husband's entree), and the bread pudding...yum. Everything is so fresh and seasoned just right, not too overdone. The chef definitely succeeds in letting the flavors of the ingredients shine. I can't forget the fun cocktails! They have a good list of wines by the glass as well.
January 29, 2011|Wonderful experience! Excellent|5|"Wonderful experience! Excellent service. Excellent wine and excellent food. My companion wasn't sure she wanted a Riesling, and our server went and got her a sample. We shared a cheese trio appetizer with cheeses from MA, RI, and VT. My companion had a chicken dish with mushroom-filled raviolis, and I had a roast duck breast with rutabaga puree that was probably the best I've tasted in a very long time. We shared a ""Baked Rhode Island"" for dessert, but it was so good we shared a second. Even my decaf espressos were wonderful. Wait staff was always there when we needed them, but never intrusive. We can't wait to be able to afford to go there again!"

January 28, 2011|We went during Restaurant|2|We went during Restaurant Week, during which I usually try out restaurants that I haven't been to before. While the dining room is gorgeous and romantic, the fact that our service was so slow (even though the dining room was never over 80 percent full the whole night) killed the evening. We were seated right at 8:30 and ordered shortly thereafter, however our appetizers did not arrive until 9:40. Mind you, we ordered a bowl of soup and a salad that was nothing more then greens and some sliced vegetables. My fish entree was ice cold, but I didn't dare send it back for fear of never seeing it again. My dining partners chicken dish fared much better thankfully and was piping hot. Desserts were good, but not memorable.

The choices were extensive. My husband had oysters on the half shell for his appetizer and I chose Rabbit with risotto. Both were delicious. My husband chose butter poached lobster for his main course and I filet with Jonah crab - both were outstanding. We can't wait to go back again. Highly recommend this restaurant. all local offerings done with great finesse and flavor.

The quality started outside the restaurant with the efficient valet parking and continued in every aspect of our dining experience. From the dining atmosphere (quiet, comfortable, romantic), to the attentive service (present when it was appropriate and non-intrusive) and outstanding preparation (use of ingredients from the New England area), presentation and taste of our appetizers and entrees there was not one misstep. Would highly recommend Local 121 to anyone looking for a truly memorable dining experience.

For $16 I think I was expecting it to be sauteed or something other than chilled it still was good could have used claw crackers. Entrees were all excellent the papardelle pasta was fantastic but I left the mussels as they were hard and overbooked. The service was some of the best, Lily was a delight. Overall I would have rated this experience as excellent except for what happened with our valet. We went to the bar for a drink then looked for our valet, he left and no one knew where our cars were, they told us they were in a lot and were not. No help nothing we finally found it parked downthe street. Not impressed !

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The calamari (which I order everywhere) was extremely creative with the pepper relish and side of feta something-or-other, the tastes were a perfect compliment to each other. The vinaigrette on the salad was light, well balanced and different, delightful. The main courses, Haddock and Chicken Polpetti, were also delicious, and the bread pudding with the candied pecans was decadent. All in all it was a very positive experience. The waitstaff were OUTSTANDING! Providence has so many wonderful restaurants to choose from, but I'd love to go back.

Both were superb and made with very fresh ingredients. Excellent. The service was as good as the food which is to say excellent. We thought the ambience was a bit off.

I prefer professional, ""crisp"" service. Something about the attitude was very ""whatever"" - they didn't seem to care if we were there or not. Pierogis were a little hard and the pasta was sticky, but flavorful. Appetizers were good - salads, eggplant caviar, vegetable fritters. Pretty dining room, though."
November 5, 2010|The food was over cooked.|1|The food was over cooked. Dry, and in some instances, way too much fry. Cardone was even spelled wrong, and then so ridiculously over cooked it was like paper. We were four people, and everyone did not like their meal. Wine was good.

From appetizers through the entrees, all the food was fantastic and creative. The wine list had some interesting gems, including some Finger Lakes and New England wines, and was fit for all budgets. Our server had a masterful knowledge of the food and all the farms where the food came from. The place has great decor in each of the three areas: restaurant, pub, and underground speakeasy. Worth a 1 hour drive from Boston for a great dinner.

We loved it all, regardless."
October 9, 2010|Given it was a busy night|3|Given it was a busy night in the city with waterfire, there was a long wait to be seated (even with reservations) as well as long spans of time between ordering and apps, then about 30-40 minutes waiting for the entrees. My partner ordered the duck (one of his favorite picks on menus usually) and was not impressed. My pork loin was good, but nothing to write home over. I believe we both left food on the plates when we left, which was not do to being over filled, but just blah about the meals. In conclusion, i feel we paid for 5 star while receiving mediocre return.

The waitress was friendly and did make an attempt to accomodate our requests but it took some effort to obtain desired items such as water or fresh ground pepper.

She owns her own organic cafe in Newport, R.I., so Local 121's "" seasonal, regional, organic sustainable cuisine"". would be a natural choice for her. I was impressed by the decor. It is modern, yet cozy and warm. The service was impeccable. I loved the bottled water, which I believe was infused with a slight hint of lemon. We shared 2 appetziers, the Purple Potato and Fresh Sweet Corn Pizza, and the Heirloom Tomato Salad. Both were delicious. Our entre choices were Pan Roasted Bomster Scallops, the Steamed Matunuck Littlenecks and the Pasta of the day. I highly recommend them all. I will return to Local"

Also tried an amazing scallop dish. Super fresh ingredients, ample portions and everything was prepared with care and was delicious.

They also ""ran out"" of specific ingredients on some dishes but didn't reflect that on the menu. The wait staff was pleasant enough, but far from stellar. We felt rushed (asking ahead of time not to be), and sent our salads back since we hadn't even finished our appetizer. The wait staff seemed inexperienced and a bit too nonchalant. We won't return."

Everything was great, I chose it because of the local ingredients featured. My only complaint is that it was a $$ listed restaurant, and most of entrees were $26 (with veggie sides being extra), unless they were a pasta dish. There was a hamburger, but if you wanted bacon, onion, mushrooms & cheese, it would be way over $20 Don't let this deter you, all I am saying is that I spent more money than I had to that night. Even though I looked on the website to get an idea of the prices, when we got there, they seemed higher. Not too pricey for a regular night out, but it should be listed as $$$.

They use only locally grown, and as often as possible, organic ingredients, and create finely crafted, thoughtfully prepared lunches and dinners. Have introduced many friends to this lovely place and they have all become converts. Have had lunch and dinner there and both are ideal. Ambiance is terrific.
June 12, 2010|We haven't been in a while,|3|We haven't been in a while, so it was nice to come back to L121. As always, the seating is exceedingly comfortable and the room is active but not overbearing which is a nice mix for Saturday night dinner. There is a lot of variety on the menu and the specials were great. I must say our server not the assistants were particularly good which had us all scratching our heads. The coffee came out cold and the was a little confusion about who ordered what. Otherwise, the food was very good, well prepared, and tasty.

We were early diners and it was not crowded. (Even Valet driver was extra accomodating) Food was so flavorful, fresh and uniquely combined for an equisitely novel but surprisingly comfort food experience! I will be back! Thank you!
June 5, 2010|Had a wonderful meal at Local|4|"Had a wonderful meal at Local 121. Tasted lots of dishes around the table and there wasn't a single misstep. Service was well timed - neither rushed nor waiting. Perfect. A must try is the ""Unicorn"" - signature champagne cocktail at Local 121. A real sweet treat. It's not a Bellini - but it's definitely one of her more attractive sisters! Loved by all. Also, immediately order the white fava bean puree for the table. It's a generous serving - perfectly seasoned - and an ideal start to the evening."
June 3, 2010|Everyone in our party celebrating|4|Everyone in our party celebrating an imminent graduation from RISD loved our meals--the fresh seafood dishes (I'm talking to you, Bomster scallops) were especially fabulous. Our server was terrific as well--spirited and good humored and kept up with the requests of our largish group admirably. The only disappointment was a lackluster, poorly executed dessert--a surprise at such a fine restaurant.

June 2, 2010|Food and ambiance were excellent.|5|Food and ambiance were excellent. Dining room is relatively small and can get noisy at busy times. Service is very good. Prices - not as high as some other top restaurants. This is close to a 5-star restaurant but prices are more at 3 1/2 star level. Restaurant is located in the theater district of Providence and service lent itself well for a pre-show dinner. We were in and out of there in about 75 minutes, without hurrying or pressing the wait staff. Food served is based on locally grown or caught foodstuffs. Recipes are creative and work well, e.g. their Caesar salad dressing is lighter than any I have tasted and still hearty; lemon based more than vinegar and anchovies. Very nice change! They do veggies and seafood well.

May 26, 2010|Ambiance, service, and food|5|Ambiance, service, and food overall were delightful. Valet parking is a big plus, especially for theater-goers. The Bomster scallop appetizer is not to be missed. The calamari appetizer was perfectly prepared. Delicious entrees! The lightness of the ingredients and portion size of some entrees will leave you wanting more, so definitely have a first course.
May 25, 2010|The ambiance service and dinners|4|The ambiance service and dinners were very tasty. The prices were a little high for the portions served. We were very disappointed with the desserts, which were both very salty!

Service was superb as we were 2 hours late getting into town because of a delayed flight but they were very accommodating. Food, wine, service - all spectacular. Fresh and organic food, which you can taste. Wish I lived in Providence just to be a regular at this restaurant.

May 18, 2010|We have dined here a few times|3|We have dined here a few times before the theater in the past. The food has always been excellent, however this is the second time we were disappointed with the size of the portions. Neither of us are big eaters and both times we were still hungry after we finished our meals. At a price of $24 for the most recent meal so I find that somewhat disconcerting. The first time we had the chickpea and sweet potatoe moroccan stew which is more like having a bowl of soup so this past time we had the herb crusted cod. The outcome was the same. We will probably try again in the fall to see if things have changed.
May 16, 2010|We tried Local 121 for the|5|We tried Local 121 for the first time Sunday night and had a wonderful dining experience. The ambiance was very comfortable, and the wait staff was pleasant, most helpful, and efficient. The fact that the restraunt uses local, seasonal produce is what brought us to the restaurant in the first place, and that fact was reflected in the quality and superior taste of the whole meal. We will definitely be back!
May 15, 2010|The food at Local 121 was|4|"The food at Local 121 was really good and would definitely go back again. The only downside was the DJ downstairs that was vibrating the floor below us and ended up getting pretty loud. I think the ""club"" downstairs should start after the dinner seatings."

They seemed to work the kinks out and had a good experience om my second visit. This was my third and final visit. Lobster bisque was served with a congealed film on top. Burger was very dry and the roll was even dryer. Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the fries.

May 8, 2010|Lovely atmosphere, a combination|5|Lovely atmosphere, a combination of old elegance and funky touches, cozy-but-not-cramped space, nice, low lighting, but not oppressively dim. Service was friendly, prompt, not intrusive. Our waiter was personable, had a sense of humor, anticipated some of our questions, but was not patronizing. Our food was very good and we were pleasantly surprised that the portions were not small/precious, but of reasonable size. Availability of valet parking is a nice (essential) plus. We were delighted with our experience at Local 121.
May 8, 2010|The food was excellent and|4|The food was excellent and they were very accomodating. We were an hour early for our reservation and they had no problem seating us. My only complaint was the mix up in my entree (ordered chicken, changed my mind to pasta before she left the table) and out came the chicken. I offered to take the chicken as the rest of our meals had come, but she said it wasn't a problem. Needless to say, my dining companions were well into their entrees before mine came out. I didn't have an opportunity to relax and enjoy my meal, I was playing catch up. I didn't expect them to comp the meal, but at least a dessert would have been appropriate. That being said, the food was excellent, our server was nice and I would go back.

April 24, 2010|This was my first time at|5|This was my first time at Local 121 and I absolutely loved it! Their website drew me in because they serve local and organnic food, but there is so much more that will bring me back for seconds and thirds! I went in on a Saturday night with a friend around 7:00pm. The seating was cozy with a nice mixture of 2-tops and bigger tables for a group. Candles and fresh flowers on every table. We started with their famous Sangria, and although you can't order it by the pitcher it was delicious. We had Calamari as an app which was cooked perfectly - not soggy not too crunchy. I had braised short ribs which were falling apart to the touch and my friend had the scallops which were amazing! We swapped dinner plates 1/2 way thru because it was so yummy!

It was so bad it was comical. I'd like to try it again because of the food and atmosphere, but please tell someone to get their act together.

While the chairs were comfortable, it felt very awkward to be sitting that low, and I noticed the same uncomfortable theme happening with other diners at the restaurant.

Delicious bean dip, cheese plate, scallops, and duck pizza. Everything was so good. We loved the organic local ingredients. Service was average. Coctails were fun."
Dined on April 16, 2010|We were seated immediately,|4|We were seated immediately, between two other tables along a wall. Our waitress was very friendly, as well as knowledgeable about the local farms the food had come from, and the wine list. The black bean soup that my husband had was extraordinary and remarkable, and my basil, tomato and fresh mozzarella salad was delicious, as well. The entrees of Littlenecks and Meatloaf served over mashed potatoes were fresh, and also delicious. All the food is from local farms, although not much of the wine is. We would have liked to have ordered some local wine by the glass. We did not have dessert, tempting as it was. My husband doesn't really eat dessert, and I couldn't eat a whole one. We would go to this restaurant again, the next time in this city.

Nice touch that they serve only locally-produced food, and the preparation and presentation were inventive. Excellent value. Will definitely return.

The food was excellent - everything was delicious - and the entire premise of the restaurant of using locally grown food is original and interesting. Loved those pea tendrils and the melt-in-you-mouth scallops.Service just right. We first ate at Local 121 on March 27, 2010 and returned with out-of-town 'foodie' friends on April 10th. Second time around didn't disappoint - all of us enjoyed our dining experience.
April 10, 2010|It is a pleasure to dine here|5|It is a pleasure to dine here because of their care to present food that is not only local, but grown and raised in a sustainalbe and moral environment. And best of all, it's delicious and prepared with love, I could taste it! No kidding! I had the Moroccan Stew, great flavor and my husband's seafood torttolini was indescribably delicious. To find a place to eat and not feel guilty is nearly impossible. This is our new find in Providence, and we plan to eat here exclusively.

April 3, 2010|I had a pretty good experience|3|I had a pretty good experience at Local 121. They pride themselves with fresh local ingredients and it shows on their menu. I wish there were more options, but with a focus on local ingredients I understand that it might be a little difficult to create a vast menu. I liked my food, but I didn't necessarily love it. The dining area is beautiful and my table was very comfortable. The service was okay, nothing spectacular but decent nevertheless. I would check it out if given the opportunity.
April 3, 2010|With all the great reviews,|2|With all the great reviews, we were a bit disappointed. The braised short rib was not as I would have expected,(fall off the bone / break apart tender, great braised rib sauce). The pasta special even with mild sausage was flavorless. Calamari was good but wonder if it was frozen...not sure. Service was good. The bar area looked nice...With so many resturants in the area, we will not return. Try Down City, Gracies, Cafe Nuvo or Mill House on s.main.
April 2, 2010|Good Food, poor table location|3|Good Food, poor table location near kitchen, felt like waitstaff was walking by every 5 seconds, too many waitstaff for the size of restaurant.
March 29, 2010|Fabulous!!! I went there and|5|Fabulous!!! I went there and had an amazing local pasta dish, with a fabulous butternut squash soup. Service was fantastic; water was constantly refilled, the hostess took our coats for us. We were waiting for a cab at the end of the night which was taking a while to come, so the Valet drove us to our final destination.
March 27, 2010|The restaurant decor and general|2|The restaurant decor and general ambiance was the best I have experienced in Providence. The bar had beautiful old woodwork but had modern touches. The restaurant itself was elegant and nicely done with a touch of the whimsical. Now the bad news. The food was average and below average. First the bartender gave me a glass of flat champagne. What, no bubbles? We had the cheese plate which was fine and safe. The house salad was good and bright with use of lots of color. The entrees of cod, was awful and had to be returned. The short ribs required much more flavor and was just bland. No dessert. Went elsewhere. Waiters were not polished and wine list on the low or high end with little in between. Go to the bar for a beer and burger only.
March 27, 2010|Some of the food was excellent;|3|Some of the food was excellent; other dishes like the fish special were mediocre and overpriced: the cod was too salty and the steak was so-so. The waiter was somewhat rude and reluctant to offer advice about the menu. The decor was beautiful, although they tried to seat us at the worst table right next to the kitchen even though the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived, and we'd made reservations. They were willing to move us to a better table upon request. We did enjoy our drinks and the shrimp toast and Moroccan stew were both excellent.
March 27, 2010|My husband and I went with|5|"My husband and I went with another couple. It was our first time there and we were drawn in by the ""all local, organic "" idea and that they get there food/herbs/ etc from local farms.. It does not disappoint. Both the small and large plates were excellent in portion size and flavor. The fried perch was paired with cold soba noodles and somehow worked perfectly. Favorites were the salmon appetizer and the fried calamari ( one of the best we have ever had). We ordered dessert and everything was fantastic. All of us agreed we would definitely go back."

March 20, 2010|So, I really want to LOVE|3|So, I really want to LOVE this restaurant. It's a great room (the dining room) and the commitment to local produce and products is great. I have eaten there at least 6 or 7 times and the meals have been uneven, mostly in terms of seasoning and preparation. The ideas for the dishes are generally quite inventive and good. But the dishes tend to be unevenly seasoned and often cooked at the wrong temperature. For example, I have tried their Point Judith calimari a few times and they clearly cook the squid in oil that is not hot enough. The result: soggy, oily squid. Last time I was there we had short ribs. the braising liquid clearly needed more seasoning and longer time to cook. The side cabbage was underseasoned and needed acid of some sort.
March 18, 2010|This was my third time eating|5|This was my third time eating at Local 121 but the first time for dinner. Our server, Lily was terrific and very accommodating. Every bit of food was spot on. The calamari appetizer with chili pepper was both familiar and yet different with the addition of the fried lemon. It was also more tender and lighter than any other I've had. The steamed Matunuck littlenecks were delicious and the baguettes were perfect to sop up the extra broth. My guest, who had never been there before remarked that it my be his new favorite restaurant. The interior is beautiful, the noise level perfect, the bar is beautiful. This is a real gem that I think foodies and non-foodies can appreciate.
March 14, 2010|local local and yummy|4|Local local local. And very engaging preparation. Decor a bit wild. But have been twice now and it's great. Not cheap. And don't go if you are rushed. They DO have a pre-theatre at a good price. Arrive early!

The restaurant had run out of my first choice, the red perch. Though I normally don't like my clams steamed, I did enjoy the steamed clams (my second choice)very much.
March 4, 2010|We enjoyed our dinner, however,|4|We enjoyed our dinner, however, the vegetarian dish (Moroccan stew) was a bit light on the portion. Could have used a more substantial side dish (the couscous was very bland and there was not very much of it). That said, my husband enjoyed his hangar steak and frites - one of his favorite meals. There was a very loud party in the main dining room and the waitstaff did their best to accomodate us by pulling a curtain. Oveall, a good experience, with a few rough spots.
March 2, 2010|Beautiful restaurant housed|5|Beautiful restaurant housed in an old hotel. Some original architecture still remains, and is beautiful. The food was innovative and delicious, with much of it from local vendors. We had a great server who not only told us where the food came from, but about the historical relevance of the building. Beautifully plated food,wonderful wine, and exceptional service, made a superb dining experience at Local 121.
February 27, 2010|2nd visit to the restaraunt.|3|2nd visit to the restaraunt. First experience was excellent. The food was fantastic it was a wonderful evening. We were looking forward to going back. The second visit was only fair. To begin with there was another couple of 2 people and 2 parties of 4 when we arrived (had reservations)at the restaurant. We were seated beside the other 2-person party. Tables were on top of eachother. I could hear their conversation without even trying. Tables were so close that the waiter could not fit between tables without turning sideways. I had the pasta which was good but my husband had the chicken which was not hot and presentation was not up to standard. We did not have coffee or dessert just anxious to leave.
February 25, 2010|An excellent, wonderfully|5|An excellent, wonderfully fresh meal, even better than the other time I ate there (which was also very good). As requested, we got a very quiet table, perfect for conversation. Many thanks!

February 14, 2010|Overall it was a nice experience|3|Overall it was a nice experience but have some concerns. Maybe should have made the fact it was Valentine's day a little more special. The overhead light in the restaurant was really bright when we got there and wasn't adjusted until well into our dinner. Our candle wasn't lit and we had to point it out to the hostess who kind of made an excuse about it. Bright light and close neighbors made us feel ackward....and the food was very salty.

My wife the vegetarian was very happy with the veg entree selection and really enjoyed her selection (Local Sweet Potato and Chickpea Morrocan Stew). I had the quail (Herb Roasted Jumbo Cavendish Farm Quail farm egg scramble) and thought it was excellent also (well cooked, data jus was the standard sweet accompaniment of quail but the farm egg scramble was enough different that I thought it stood out). A shared bread pudding was excellent (and 2 appetizers also enjoyed). Service was slow but the hostess noticed and offered (unexpectedly, we didn't ask) free cocktails. Prices were very good too and the free valet parking is very useful. We'll be going again.
February 13, 2010|121 was OK. The tables are|2|121 was OK. The tables are VERY close in proximity to one another. We felt like we were in everyones conversations around us.

I appreciate that they support local producers, which is a concern of mine, but my main concern is that I can sit down with two other couples and focus on good company. Everything from the cocktails to the desserts were enjoyable and that made for a wonderful time.

All of the food is always bursting with delicate flavor, while still maintaining an artful balance. It's a bit pricey, but perfect for special occasions. When you walk in, it seems very dressy due to the decor, but most everyone dresses very casually. The wait staff is also great, friendly, and down to earth. If you want to take the low-key route, they have two bars- one upstairs and one downstairs with live music. Definitely the place to be whether at a bar or in the dining room, with a friendly and classy atmosphere.

November 27, 2009|This restaurant has a great|2|"This restaurant has a great location and is beautiful inside. The service OK with friendly staff, but we waited quite a long time between the appetizer and the main course when the restaurant was half empty. The food was very disappointing. The ""risotto"" was not a risotto at all but more like a hearty barley or grain dish. It was not creamy and not at all what we were expecting, and it was accompanied by a boring half plate of greens tossed with an uninspired dressing. The pork belly dish was also quite small, and the scallops were overcooked. The salads we had for appetizers were also just a conglomeration of greens without really any other vegetables added in for interest. I will not return to Local 121 - too many other choices around."
November 21, 2009|Fall menu was delicious, our|4|Fall menu was delicious, our table had duck, chicken, beef, and pasta - all were to rave reviews. Waitstaff were super friendly (if not quite on the ball - we got too wrong drinks and a couple forgotten request, but it was also busy) and on the whole, definitely plan to return.
November 14, 2009|We have visited Local 121|5|We have visited Local 121 twice now and have had very good experiences both times. The food choices are different and very good. Our server (same person both times) was excellent. She was attentive without being intrusive. The one error that occurred was speedily corrected (an entree was ordered without sausage but arrived with it). The only negatives were that the valet service closed at 10:30pm which interrupted our dinner, and the restaurant started to fill up around 11pm with noisy diners who appeared from their attire to be waiting to get into a local nightclub.
November 14, 2009|We love the idea of local|3|We love the idea of local food. We are CSA members in our community. Beautiful Restaurant, excellent service, great location… Yummy: both the Roasted Sweet Potato Flatbread Pizza and Pan-Roasted Long Island Duck Breast-quite good (except they substituted escarole instead of the advertised baby bok choy.) Cons: Curried Orange Lentil Dip tasted strange - like cooks reaching too far for a new taste. Same with the Roasted Sweet Carrot and Parsnip Farro Risotto. My son made the mistake of ordering a med-well “Aquidneck Farms Grass-Fed Angus Burger” – even so it was over-cooked… the “Bacon Wrapped Grilled Bomster Scallops” were okay but, I’ve had much better…
November 14, 2009|We were seated by behind the|3|We were seated by behind the hostess station which was not a very good seat. Also, our waiter came over right away to pour water but then disappeared for sometime and we were waiting to order cocktails and dinner. He was very nice. It also appeared his section was full so we gave him the benefit of the doubt. One of the hostesses did jump in for him when she realized that we were waiting. The dinner was good. I had the carrot bread pudding for dessert and it was a HUGE disappointment. Maybe they should try pumpkin, cranberry, apple or something along those lines but the carrot was not good.
November 14, 2009|The food was good, but extremely|3|The food was good, but extremely salty. The service was all right, but not stellar. The focus on local food producers is impressive, and the main reason why we would go back.

Did take a little longer than usual for things to come out but it was also a Saturday night. I always recommend Local 121 to friends and bring visiting friends and family there when they're in town!

The food was well prepared and arrived to the table in a very timely manner. The only change I would suggest (realizing that space in the restaurant is limited) is that they reconfigure tables set for two. I felt as though I was on the Newport Dinner train sharing my meal with the couple that was next to us. Not the place to take your significant other if you're looking for privacy and romance.
October 24, 2009|We greatly enjoyed our dining|4|We greatly enjoyed our dining experience. The menu was especially unusual but not over ambitious with well thought out entrees and small plates that featured local ingredients.
October 23, 2009|The food is not very impressive.|2|The food is not very impressive. The place is beautiful. The waitstaff was helpful but not amazing. We had a reservation and still had to wait for half an hour to be seated. They seem to be very impressed with themselves, but that impression did not extend to me.
October 20, 2009|Local 121 is by far one of|5|"Local 121 is by far one of the BEST restaurants in Providence for many reasons. The menu is always inventive, delicious, and well priced. The location is perfect for theatre, shopping, or WaterFire, too. It's a treat to have a ""local"" restaurant in RI that makes such an enormous effort to highlight the many foods of New England AND to do such a wonderful job with them in the kitchen. We are lucky to have it in our little state!"
October 17, 2009|We have been to local 121|2|We have been to local 121 several times and, sadly, I have to say this last time was not up to par. First, we were shown a table that was dreadful - in an alcove, sharing a bench with a group that was too large for their own table and spilling over. Next, the service was inattentive and lacked any sense of pride or charm. And thirdly, the food was okay, but not memorable. Will try one more time, but that may be it.
October 17, 2009|My family had a very nice|4|My family had a very nice meal at Local 121. My 17 year old is not an adventurous eater so the grass-fed burger on a challah roll really made things easier for her; the rest of us tried clams, scallops and quail and all were good. The decor is attractive, the service pleasant and the effort to locally source their food much appreciated. Brown Family Weekend made it a busy time, but reservations were available on Open Table even when not available by calling the restaurant, and we were welcomed and not rushed.
October 16, 2009|Nicest people, wonderful renovated|4|Nicest people, wonderful renovated building, nice bar, live music etc. Food was really fresh and local and delicious. It was a different menu, veggie friendly and very seasonal and tasted fresh. Service was very friendly but totally disorganized. Inspite of that I loved it. Ask for one of the banquettes for a family celebration.
October 16, 2009|This was our fourth time at|2|"This was our fourth time at Local 121 and sadly, the food, service and general atmosphere have all slipped a notch. We had to wait several minutes for the hostess to appear, while wait staff rushed by and failed to even make eye contact. Our server referred to us as ""guys"" all evening (our group of three included two 50-something adults and a college student). By the time of our 7 p.m. reservation they were already down to 1 order of the evening's special and the wine we ordered off the wine list was no longer available. My entree (another special) was served without the sauce. I will give them another chance, but was pretty disappointed for what ends up being a $100+ dining experience."

Even though it was a weekend night and the place was full, we could still carry on a conversation. The food was a bit different, in a good way. My husband loved the chowder; he said it was light and tasty. The calamari was tender, flavorful, and satisfying. The heirloom tomato salad was fresh and sweet. The fish was cooked to perfection. And the home-made desserts were wonderful. The fact that the ingredients were local was an added benefit. Another thing that we appreciated was the wine list. It had a variety of interesting wines that were reasonable in price. This is becoming one of our favorites.

September 5, 2009|Our party of 4 arrived at|3|Our party of 4 arrived at the restaurant and were seated promptly. The ambience was good, white tablecloths and not noisy. Our waiter appeared quickly, offering to explain menu items and wine choices. The restaurant prides itself on dealing with local merchants, and indeed an impressive list of those vendors was contained within the menu. The cheese plate we started with was excellent, although it would have been helpful if the waiter had explained what the different cheeses were. The Pan Roasted Cavendish Farm Quail was the largest quail dish we've ever seen, including two quail, with delightful sides of peas, carrots, and onions. The Boyden Farm Grilled Flat Iron Steak was also a big hit, perfectly grilled with braised greens.

The fact that nearly everything on the menu was drawn from local sources made it all the more delicious! Our dinner was fresh but not plain and artfully plated. From the lightly breaded calamari to the fresh caught mahi mahi(off Rhode Island shores!) and the grass fed beef steak, to the peach ice cream and blueberry parfait, everything was fantastic. We definitely recommend this restaurant.
August 19, 2009|The first time we went here|3|The first time we went here we LOVED it! Local ingredients, swank atmosphere. This second time was a bust. The food was bland and grey. We thought having local seafood would be a standout - unfortunately it was a downer.

July 31, 2009|The food was excellent. We|4|"The food was excellent. We had the johnnycakes and crabcakes as appetizers and both were quite good. The main courses we sampled were the Chipotle glazed chicken and the striped bass. My wife said the bass dish was the best she ever had. Th chicken was also very good, very moist and a nice kick to the glaze. Blueberry pie dessert was very nice, but the bread pudding was not so great. The server should have made it clear it was a savory dessert and not a sweet dessert. Maybe it should have been an appetizer. Didn't like it much. By the way, try tne ""unicorn"" specialty drink from the bar. Very nice. Service was quick but not exceptional. Our server wasn't all that interested in helping us make a good selection."
July 18, 2009|The ambiance at this restaurant|3|The ambiance at this restaurant is amazing: seats are plush, the decor is unified and beautiful. However, the restaurant week menu was a little lack-luster, with heavy handed seasoning and combinations that weren't particularly original.
July 17, 2009|Ambiance is great. Drink menu|3|"Ambiance is great. Drink menu is great. Food is local and sustainable - but underwhelming. I wanted them to do a little more than throw some local snap peas on the plate. It's good, but it's not very special or ""wow""."
July 8, 2009|This place is great for good|5|This place is great for good conversation and fun, however, it might be hard to notice those you're at the table with while you're admiring the cool and trendy, yet upscale and fancy, restaurant you're being served in. The food is excellent, and it's always a double-treat to know that you're enjoying the unique experience of eating in a one of a kind restaurant with local foods that can't be replicated by any chain you could easily find anywhere else in the country. I highly recommend.
July 2, 2009|My husband and I had dinner|5|My husband and I had dinner here last week and we both walked away saying how great it was! We started off with some of the summer drink specials - the vodka lemonade, sangria, and lemon ginger martini were all great - and bacon wrapped scallops... they were fantastic and made us even more excited for dinner. I had the fresh pasta and my husband had the striped bass (one of the specials) and the combination of flavors was so good and so fresh. We also enjoyed dessert - the smores were a great end to an awesome dinner. The service was excellent - attentive but not too much so and helpful with recommendations. We will definitely be going back and will stop in the bar side for a drink - looks like a fun place to hang out.
June 28, 2009|The 3rd time at Local 121|5|The 3rd time at Local 121 this year, my experience was again fabulous. Among appetizers, the calamari were clean and fresh, battered tempura-style, with perfect bite, and finished with hints of lime, mint, and scallions. Among the mains, the scallops (best in town) were perfectly cooked, served in a mild ginger broth; and the lobster risotto was out of this world, an exciting harmony of textures, moistness, and flavors of lobster, maitake, peas, and rice. The desserts were excellent too, led by a juicy strawberry-rhubarb parfait and a refined bread pudding. Competent, personable service; great wine recommendation; generous pours of wines by the glass. Perhaps the best place in town, and very reasonable prices for this top quality.

June 16, 2009|Great find. The best way to|4|Great find. The best way to describe the food here is : fresh. I had the haddock and it was very light and cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had the chicken breast, which she clamored over. The sides complemented the main course very well, however the portions were a little small. The beer selection was pretty decent (lots of eclectic microbrews), and the mixed drinks were made very well. The atmosphere was a bit closed (oversized/comfy chairs shrank the room), but it was still very cozy. Not for big parties, but definitely good for a date nite (2-4). The waitstaff was very nice. We'll be back.

When we first walked in we were impressed with the elegant dining decor. The food was outstanding. The clam chowder (Rhode Island style) was fresh and even had some fresh clams in the shell..... a nice touch. The Lentil dip was fantastic and there was enough dip and hot pita triangles for the 4 of us to try. The haddock, chicken and scallops arrive at the table piping hot and the flavor of each was extremely tasty and again the seafood indescribably fresh. The only dish that was disappointing was the vegetable stew..... which ironically is why we chose the restaurant. The home made ice cream and pana cotta were a nice ending to a wonderful night
May 31, 2009|If you're looking for a quiet|4|"If you're looking for a quiet place to dine that will leave you forgetting that you're in a restaurant, this is the place. Large, comfortable leather chairs to sit in and a great ""country club"" feel welcome you into this restaurant. The food was good, but won't compare to some of your other fine dining establishments. Service was also average, but the setting itself outweighed anything average about this restaurant. The bar attached to the restaurant was also very quaint and inviting."
May 30, 2009|This was our first experience|5|This was our first experience at Local 121, but it won't be our last. The food was complex in flavor and perfectly balanced. Over dessert we were talking about when we would come back! Excellent scallops, fresh calamari. The service was unobtrusive and unpretentious, and our server gave a great suggestion. I look forward to tasting their grass-fed beef when I return.
May 22, 2009|The food was excellent and|5|The food was excellent and the staff was very attentive. The decor and ambiance are very sophisticated. The space is small and the tables are fairly close together, so there is some noise from nearby conversations, but it does not interfere with normal conversation. Since the food is expertly prepared and presented, there is plenty of time for conversation between courses. I am not sure children would appreciate the dining experience.
May 19, 2009|fabulous local-only food with|5|fabulous local-only food with an organic and small-farm slant. we sat at the bar and all aspects of the food were wonderful - the bartender (who was gorgeous, incidentally) gave us suggestions on every course and was spot-on throughout. my only gripe is when the crowd started picking up, they switched from classic upbeat jazz to radio-friendly pop in the bar and then a DJ started up, but at a volume afew clicks higher than the current vibe in the room.
May 16, 2009|I went for a birthday celebration|5|I went for a birthday celebration with my family. Local 121 proved to be a memorable dining experience. The food was exquisite and unique. My father, who is hard of hearing- especially in most restaurants- had no trouble hearing everyone in the comfy circular booth we were seated in. I would definitely go back again and recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine cuisine.
May 9, 2009|I visit Providence periodically|4|I visit Providence periodically to see my daughter and this is my third time at 121. The food is always good and all 4 of use liked their appetizers and main courses. I like the idea of using local produce, which necessitates that the menue (which is quite creative) changes frequently. The only downside of 121 is the lack of parking (althoug a valet service is available) and the fact that it is a bit overpriced.

May 7, 2009|I love the idea of having|3|I love the idea of having a restaurant that uses local foods, and the ingredients were indeed fresh and delicious. That said, they could have put more effort into flavoring the dishes. They were very very simple (and small), especially given the high price. I'm happy to have supported them, but there are many many other restaurants in the city with better flavor and value.
May 3, 2009|Visiting Providence for Cox|5|Visiting Providence for Cox Marathon, I dined alone. Seated on the bar side: informal, moderately noisy. Parents, young children and many people at the bar. I had the pasta special: fresh spinach pasta, pickled beets and chevre. The food+service were terrific so I brought my Sweetheart for a post-race celebration. Dining room is intimate, quiet, comfortable. Starter: fried calamari; tasty, lighter, less breaded than typical. We chose the Albarino to pair; very nice. For entree, we paired a Steltzner Claret that was richly layered. She had the steak special: perfect! My pork chop was a bit overdone, but still delish. Turnip+sauerkraut, pork, Claret, ah! Staff was warm and welcoming; way above average for NE

The service was casual not matching the ambiance. My party was disappointed in the menu selections, April 30th and still serving winter and fall dishes such as sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts and apple parsnip soup. I guess it's best not to have expectations but where are the spring greens: fiddlehead ferns, dandilion greens, arugula, asparagus and lighter cooking preparations which would make us eager to come back to check out the summer fare! Are we glad we went yes! Would we go back again, probably not.

April 23, 2009|The service was fantastic.|5|The service was fantastic. I couldn't decide what to order so when the waitress came by I told her I needed her to tell me what to eat. She gave me her top 3 choices and told me why for each. I chose the pork chop and was very glad I did. She suggested it because she thought the flavors went together very well, and she was completely right. I wasn't completely impressed by their cheese trio appetizer (I've had better), but I have to give props to any restaurant that offers one. The one negative thing I found was that the choices on their menu are very limited, I think there were perhaps 6 or 7 entrees. It's not the kind of place where anyone can find anything to eat. But that being said, I loved it and I will go back!
April 18, 2009|This location has a valet|5|This location has a valet and that was a real plus for me......The menu was limited but all fresh and organically prepared...they actually support local farms in the area....Food was outstanding, drinks were a notch above the rest, very unique and they even created a drink for another table that they did not carry on the menu, Keylime pie martini, nice of them to do that!! I would recommend this place to college and up, even though there were a couple of children dinig here I did not see a kids menu anywhere. Great place for a date, no matter the age!!

What else can I say - it is my favorite restaurant in Providence. If you can't make a reservation try eating in the bar. There are tables and you can order off the regular menu. We have done that as well - they have speciality cocktails that are wonderful. Can't wait to go back :-)

But now it has the last three times the food has been consistent and outstanding. So if you have gone in the past and not had a great experience, go back you will not be disappointed. Two of us had the Mustard Crusted Gloucester Grey Sole with almonds, brown butter, carrots; parsnips the other two had Wolfe's Neck Farm Grilled Flat Iron Steak compound butter, hand-cut fries, garlicky Tuscan kale. Both dinners were amazing.

Loved the fact they had valet parking. Overall a good experience.

The food was fresh, well prepared and presented and perfectly prepared and seasoned. The atmosphere is amazing. It is plush and romantic, yet not pretentious or stuffy. The feeling is as if one were stepping back to the days of glamorous Hollywood. The service was a bit disjointed at time, but never lacking. Overall, this was a wonderful dining experience I will look forward to repeating soon.
February 21, 2009|The food is excellent here,|5|The food is excellent here, but I want to say a word about the service. I've dined at 121 twice now, and each time the service was exquisite: friendly without being overbearing, very welcoming. On my last visit, we were the last people seated, after seeing a play at Trinity. Within 20 minutes of placing our order, we were the only people left in the restaurant, but at not point did we feel rushed, or as if we were imposing. Our waitress was lovely, friendly, and gracious. The service is simply superb.
February 21, 2009|it was leisurely dining .|4|it was leisurely dining . we didin't feel rushed. the food was wonderful the ambience terrific . we felt as if we were in another country. very charming. the snafu was with the wine; it was listed as a provence rose 2007 and they brought a bottle of 2006 (too old)and had no adequate explination or recommendation . at that point we nixed the wine with dinner idea. when the bill came they had charged us for 3 desserts we hadn't ordered . they readily corrected it. we had noted on your contact when we made the reservation that it was a birthday celebration and nothing was mentioned ,done or noted by staff about that. we had a good time regardless!
February 21, 2009|This is a great place for|3|"This is a great place for the best ""gourmet ""burger and fries! The fries tasted like clam cakes! The decor and bar are well appointed, service was good, and drinks were great. I gave a ""good"" rating for food and overall because the clam dish was on the salty side and the stuffy was just good."
February 20, 2009|I was really disappointed|2|I was really disappointed in Local 121 (2/20, 7:30pm reservation, Table 51, party of 4). From the service -- where our waiter literally disappeared for a 15-minute span, still not showing up once we requested his presence -- to the bland appetizers and underwhelming main courses, this restaurant does little to celebrate local ingredients. Bluefish fritters & stuffies were mostly bread crumbs, calamari was not crispy or flavorful (apart from the very salty aioli). Specialty cocktails mixed by the bar were excellent and a couple quite unique. The fingerling potatoes are perfectly fried and salted. The ice creams are also worth trying. Beautiful and nicely decorated space. Shame the food doesn't execute the mission more successfully.

February 15, 2009|The food was great and decor|3|The food was great and decor was beautiful but they somehow did not match up. I thought the decor was a little too formal for the food and in fact would prefer the decor to be a little more casual. Being an advocate for the local food movement I was disappointed that the servers were not as passionate about the cause as I was. There were no background stories about where products were from and they did not seem very interested in the cause. I would go back because I really want to love everything about this place but hope the staff gets more involved in the menu and where ingredients are from.
February 14, 2009|Overall this was a somewhat|1|"Overall this was a somewhat enjoyable experience, until the food arrived. I have no issues with eclectic cuisine, and rather enjoy it. My real issue is not accurately describing the food that you are serving. I ordered the pasta special, which on this particular night, was described as a ravioli with nuts and cheese. When my meal arrived however, I was treated to a wet, soggy, lasagna noodle sprinkled with toppings. When I inquired about the dish, I was told in a rather condescending tone, ""oh sir, this is a free-form ravioli"". Not only was this never described on the menu, it was just so poorly executed to the point it was not edible. This was not my first trip to Local121, but I can assure you it was the last."
February 14, 2009|Really enjoyed the ambiance|5|Really enjoyed the ambiance and our waitress... food was great and I was very impressed with how everyone worked together and no one waited if they had reservations... it was very impressive for the crazy Valentine's day rush. We'll be back again.

Won't be going back there for valentine's day unless the talor the menu more towards the holiday. Just putting flowers on the table and having oysters on he key doesn't cut it. Jazz it up a little!
February 14, 2009|My wife and I chose to try|2|My wife and I chose to try Local 121 for Valentines and it turned out to be the worst decision we could of made. First of all, the price of the prix fix menu was excessive at $65 per person. Secondly, we had a reservation at 8pm and they had already run out of one (rib eye steak) menu item. Secondly, some tables received bottles of water and some didn't which, coincided with the overall inconsistent service from the waitstaff. Thirdly, my wife and I both ordered the Gnocchi as our first course item and both received significantly overcooked Gnocchi which, was so soft you had to scoop it up from your plate like it was soup. Overall, poor service, poor food quality, very expensive and I would not recommend it to friends.
February 14, 2009|I was not impressed at all.|2|I was not impressed at all. Being valentine's day, they had a choice of 4 entrees. Our reservation was at 8:00 and already they were out of one of the choices. The side on one of the entrees, sauteed escarole, was so bitter it was inedible. The service was slow and we were left waiting after each course. The interior of the bar and restaurant was very attractive. The wine we had was very, very good and the dessert was good. All in all, I won't go back again.
February 14, 2009|The dining experience was|3|"The dining experience was ok at best. Since I dined there on a ""holiday"" (Valentine's Day) the menu was limited. I'll give this restaurant another try when there is a full menu. From what was available on the menu, if you're a picky eater, I'd suggest that you don't eat here as the menu was quite ""Top Chef""-ish, but if you're looking for something eclectic, then Local 121 is your place."
February 14, 2009|Had a good experience at Local|3|"Had a good experience at Local 121. But with so many great restaurants in Providence, any one place has to make quite an impression to be a standout. Food was well prepared and presented, but not remarkable. Service was good, but again, not remarkable. Decor and ambiance were quite nice - in fact, perhaps the most remarkable thing about the place. Two disappointments: 1) the focus on ""local"" foods seemed a little superficial when we discovered the wine list only had two local wines by the glass and the beef came from Vermont, not RI; and 2) the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu was pretty steep and left us a little wanting."

The calamari was tender and tasty and the scallops cooked to perfection with a lovely sauce accompanying the vegetables underneath. The reason we gave the food only four stars is that the bread pudding we ordered was so burned on the bottom and generally overcooked that we had to send it back. However, the rest of the meal was so good that we will be back as soon as possible to explore the other creative items on the menu.
February 10, 2009|This was my second visit to|4|This was my second visit to Local 121, and once again my companions and I were very pleased with our experience. I particularly appreciate the philosophy of the place, which uses locally-sourced ingredients as much as possible. Of course, that wouldn't matter so much if the food weren't skillfully prepared, but the dishes are consistently excellent and imaginative. I highly recommend Local 121, but make reservations since it is on the small side and seems pretty popular.

I appreciate the good prices on the wine as well...nothing burns me more than wone that is marked up so much you feel guilty odering what you really want. The only thing that I would change would be your dessert choices. So many of us love rich, fudge brownie desserts and chocolate cake wasn't calling to me. Otherwise, everything was fantastic. We'll be back soon!

The menu was interesting - heavy on the apparently abundantly available parsnip, which I've never eaten. Despite the seemingly interesting choices, the food was a bit ""hit or miss."" I had bacon-wrapped scallops to start, which were fine, but not particularly interesting. The red onions added, though. Two of my companions shared the calamari, which was weird. The batter was actually NOT tasty, though the sauce was good. I had the quail entree, which was dully flavored. While I've never cooked a quail, it was one of those dishes that you eat with regret, and not for the little bird. The scallop entree was great."

Our meals were great and being locally grown and harvested food is a plus. My dates cod and my flat iron steak were cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. One downside to the meal were the french fries that came with my steak, they lacked execution. A french fry should never be raw, they weren't in the fryer for longer than 2 minutes. But the server took care of it and brought my another side of fries. Overall our experience was great and we'll go back for sure.

Our meal, however, was simply okay. I guess I was expecting much more. We started with two different salads which were fresh and generally good, but nothing to tell your friends about. The poached pears in the salad were the best part. Our main entrees (the flat iron steak, and the evening's special Vermont stew) were also good but not to the level you might expect given the potential this place has. The wine list was reasonable, the seasonal cocktails extremely inventive. We'll be going back to try some of the other menu items because we really want to like this place. Valet parking was a big plus.

We mad reservations 1 month from our expected dinner date. We where meeting another couple and a little late so they where at the bar when we arrived. Our table was ready, but we decided to have a drink at the bar beore sitting down. Great drinks great selection, great enviroment. The waitress came over to us and asked if we needed any drinks and let us know about the nightly specials. She then proceeded to tell us we had only 1 hour and 15 minutes because they where closing for a private party. We decided to leave

It also has a great bar build-out that gets a good crowd most nights.

October 3, 2008|The ambiance was very relaxed|3|The ambiance was very relaxed for first impression at local 121. Interesting furniture and definitely romantic lighting. The food menu and wine list was creative and contemporary going along with the local food theme. However, In my opinion, I think the chef is playing too much with the flavor of the dishes. Having locally sourced ingredients is a dream, yet the flavor/sauces often overpowers the main ingredient instead of enhancing them. One example was the duck confit, it would have been perfect without the sauce. The deep fried chicken liver salad was confusing because of the bland vinaigrette,(maybe because salad was still wet with water). Overall style and creativity is there but taste and confusing food theme needs fresh air.

Coffee, ice tea and fresh cold water. EVery aspect of the entree and small plates were fabulous, calamari, sweet, tender, lightly crusted with an atradional garlic, mayo and olive oil sauce that wonderful. Would definitely recommend Local 121 and I will be returning with friends.

Sign on door said tap room was open; it was at least the door was - no one was inside, no lights were on and the chairs were all up on the tables (12:15 p.m. Monday August 4) extremely embarrasing for me professionally.

They did find a table for us, not a great location, but adaquate. During the meal I asked our server to research it as I had the confirmation number on my cell phone. She came back and said she found it and our OT account would be created. Food very local and fresh. Portions were good. Try the golf ball size clam/cheese balls; they were delicious. Very varied menu with lots of choices. For our first time in Providence, it was very nice. Probably would try somewhere else the next time, not for any bad feelings for Local 121 but for there being so many other places in Providence.

For example, when they were clearing our dishes, they not only stacked the dishes at the table, but they set down a stack of cleared dishes from our table ontop of the empty dish in front of one of our party in order to add that person's dish to the stack and take the pile away. This was very unprofessional.

July 26, 2008|Food was overpriced and mediocre|2|Food was overpriced and mediocre at best. A porterhouse pork chop, for instance, was something you could have picked up at Stop and Shop and thrown on the frying pan at home, a skinny, tasteless bit of overcooked pig. The cheese burger at $12 looked o.k., but I noticed two different orders of them being sent back to the kitchen. Service was pleasant but very slow. I think that they could probably use one more person on the wait staff. The idea of a menu consisting of local or regional ingredients is excellent, but, unfortunately, at least on the night we were there, it did not seem to come together as impressive at all. I would say it was more depressing, actually.

May 30, 2008|Good ambience and wine selection.|3|Good ambience and wine selection. Weak on menu selections. Flank steak at a restaurant like this is unacceptable. Serving alot of poor man's food at rich man prices. Would have expected to see filet mignon, halibut, lobster, lamb, etc. Instead of flank steak- very tough steak (will injure you tmj's for pete's sake) stuffies, to many pasta dishes, red fish- which is tough, pork, These are all low quality food. They have sobet and we weren't even offered sorbet before the main course when it is to be served. So clearly the Chef doesn't have good knowledge of proper dinning seqence. The waiting kept asking to take our plates even though we were displaying rest with our utensil. These are basic waiter knowledge. Don't think I will return.

The atmosphere is refined and elegant, the staff are very casual and relaxed while maintaining a professional demeanor. For some that may be offputting but I think overall the laid back refinement was evident in all aspects of the dining experience. The food was very good with an elegant rustic quality. The atmosphere was rather ecclectic with a bar reminiscent of an Irish pub with beautiful stained glass a great contrast to the quaint modern feel of the dining room. I would certainly reccomend Local 121 to anyone in search of a spot for dining, cocktails, relaxation or any combination of the three.

We were with 2 friends, one of whom had the same clams I had and didn't finish them for the reasons above. The other person had the scallops, which were good, but not as tasty as ones I've had at Al Forno's or La Laiterie. The highlight of the meal were the salads, which were fresh and had just the right amount of dressing. We had eaten there once before and had excellent food, so we're hoping that this experience was not the total norm.

May 3, 2008|The fried clams arancini was|3|The fried clams arancini was very good. The pasta was a bit dry and not as flavorful as I would have liked. The service from our waiter was intermittent. He started off attentive and then he faded away. We had to ask someone else for our wine.
May 3, 2008|There were only three tables|3|There were only three tables for two. We were the first to arrive and were seated at a table for two. The second party to arrive was also a party of two and were seated next to us. The tables were so close that I felt uncomfortable. I would only return with a group of three or more. I would never return with just two people.
May 2, 2008|Local 121 named cocktail was|3|Local 121 named cocktail was fairly nasty (the cardamom cocktail was much better). Appetizers (smelts, stuffies) were good but unremarkable, entree of bomster scallops over quinoa was absolutely outstanding--a definite standout. Desserts (pound cake, cardamom and honey ice cream) were surprisingly good. Food was uneven over all, but when it was good (as in the case of the scallops) it was truly exceptional. Atmosphere was lively, nice if unmemorable decor. Would go back to try the summer seasonal menu.
May 2, 2008|I have always a great time|3|I have always a great time whenever I dine at Local 121. At first, I was amazed at the decoration, which I didn't expect at all from the appearance of the building and the outside environment. I love the fact that the restaurant supports local ingredients, which makes me sure that the food is fresh. Except for one dinner I had, when everything was very salty, I have been pretty satisfied with the food. The butternut squash puree soup, which I had last time at lunch, was one of the best one I've ever had!

Drawbacks were: food took 45+ minutes to arrive (way too long), and there was a private function below us where the bass was thumping under our dinner table all night long - very annoying.
April 26, 2008|We enjoyed the food at Local|3|We enjoyed the food at Local 121 very much but the service was awful. We were seated without a drinks/wine menu and had to wait close to 10 minutes before our waiter showed up at the table. He then came back and took our entire order even though we indicated we only wanted to order drinks and appetizers and would like to hold off ordering wine/dinner. The drinks didn't show up until the appetizers did and then the meals showed up prior to our having finished the appetizers. The wine however didn't show up until we caught our waiter's attention and asked for it again (we got it at least 10 minutes after we had started the meals). We had planned on having dessert and coffee but couldn't stand the thought of waiting for our waiter again,
April 25, 2008|We had a wonderful meal and|4|We had a wonderful meal and then went to the theater. We returned for a drink afterwards and had a slightly different experience. Admitted, we are a bit older than the young groups that were enjoying the bar. We found a table and then attempted to find a waitperson. The girl who was assigned to us, evidently wanted to leave early and ignored us. Finally, a young man agreed to take our order! It was a surprising occurance. We will continue to enjoy the restaurant, but will probably skip the bar in the future.

April 19, 2008|This was literally the worst|1|"This was literally the worst meal I have ever had at a supposedly ""fancy"" restaurant! First issue was the Stuffed fried clams came out and were frozen in the middle...firstly what nice restaurant serves frozen fish? Then when they brought them back hot they looked like someone had put their fingers in it to check the temperature, it looked like clam mush. The main course (steak for me and a burger for my date) were so over salted we physically could not eat it. I tried to give a last ditch effort and try the ""coffee"" ice cream which was completely indistinguishable from the Vanilla. After the appetizer debaucle no one asked how anything was from that point forward...this crap cost us $122 for two. Definitely do not recommend!!"

The food is delicious and they pride themselves on local ingredients, including some of the wines. I've enjoyed it for late-night and now for lunch. I will be back again. I'd love to have dinner there. I recommend it.
April 13, 2008|The food was very good, with|4|The food was very good, with some unique approaches and very sensible styles. Some of the food was fun, and one could easily organize a meal of appetiziers. The pork shank was fabulous. The interior was very surprising. It was a much more sophisticated design in the dining room than I had anticipated. The bar looked like it was fun, and there was live music that could be heard from the dining room. It was however, not overpowering. The one weakness that we noted was our service. We seemed to have the slower model of waitress. She was hesitant, confused at times, and struggled to find us menus. We waited approximately 15 minutes to get menus for our entire party. We rushed to our show yet arrived two hours prior.

April 8, 2008|A great concept (local food)|2|"A great concept (local food) that I want to wholeheartedly support. Felt confused by the experience: beautiful chairs and decor, love the windows, lovely setting, but the food did not match the ""fanciness"" of the surroundings. Seems that the presentation/quality of the food could be raised OR the decor/feel could be changed for a more experimental/""down-home"" feel. There is no excuse for bad service, and the service was not just slow (don't mind taking my time), but inattentive."
April 8, 2008|While the food, service, and|4|While the food, service, and ambience were excellent, to me the best thing about Local 121 is its philosophy: use locally-produced (and usually humanely and/or organically-raised) ingredients to produce an outstanding, creative menu which varies with the seasons. Besides being a pleasurable dining experience, eating at Local 121 is a political act. My only complaints are it is a bit expensive, and I wish there were more information available at the restaurant about their sources. You can track down this information online, but it'd be fun and convenient to have something to read and discuss at the table.
April 6, 2008|Four of us thoroughly enjoyed|4|"Four of us thoroughly enjoyed our first dining experience at Local 121. My crisp, tasty salad, seasonal soup and goat cheese tart were all scrumptious. One diner was intrigued with the smelts, another enjoyed the fresh pasta special and yet another a delicious seafood dish. The only mediocre appetizer was the edemame which seemed to be rather bland. I love the ""50 mile"" focus - with local and naturally raised meat and vegetables...it was one of the main reasons we wanted to try the restaurant. We love the valet parking the opportunity to eat so well and then walk down to Trinity on a Sunday night. We will definitely go again and can't wait to try the other delicious sounding treats on the menu!"
