When we inquired about our table they were a bit put off and sat us at that point. Was our first time there and this didn't start off the visit well. Positives- Valet Staff, waiter was very attentive, decor of place was excellent, view of water place park and Providence was awesome. The cons- the attentiveness and friendliness of check in staff was rather poor. I had expected a bit more from the food. It was okay but was expecting a bit more from this upscale venue. The drinks were very well made and were great. All in all not sure we would return for another visit.
ays ago|Server was great.  Food was not so great.|3|My husband and I wanted to try some different Asian Cuisine, so we ordered Appetizers and Entrees. Typically we'd stick with Sushi or some type of Hibachi, but decided to venture out of the box. Our black bean Clams Appetizer took a while to come out and when it did, the peppers were still crisp and it was very soupy. For the price we paid, it was not worth the money. My husband thought the clams were a bit undercooked. My GS Chicken breading was falling off as I was eating it. There was way too much sauce with it. My husband had the Pad Thai with Beef and the noodles were drenched in oil and again very soggy. The only thing we enjoyed were the Gyoza's. I wish we enjoyed the food because the location is great.
February 19, 2016|Great food, beautiful location|5|This was one of many visits to Jacky's and we have never been disappointed. Excellent quality food, generous servings and great service. Scenic location right on the canal. The valet parking takes away the challenge of parking in downtown Providence and return of our car was prompt and courteous. We were celebrating a special occasion and the loveliness of the settings, linen, flowers, added to that. Thanks!
February 18, 2016|Excellent again!|5|Awesome food, beautiful place, great view, attentive service. We will be back.
February 17, 2016|Mmm... okay but nothing great|3|Everything is ok here, but for the location and the price I would expect something better. I ordered the general tao's chicken breast, but the chicken was definitely not just chicken breast.

I would go again but wont have as high of an expectation
February 13, 2016|Honoring reservations|4|After reserving a spot for 6:45, we unfortunately were not seated until over half-hour later. The bar provides a nice place to wait, but we'd rather have timely seating!
February 13, 2016|Biggest night of my life!|5|I went online to make reservations saturday morning last minute and found a table at 1030 at night. I planned a proposal to my now fianc√© . We are not necessarily late nighters and she didn't want to go but I though if I called I would be able to squeeze in earlier. Sure enough when I called the receptionist was incredibly nice and got us a table at 645. Long story short the sushi chefs and our waitress put together an amazing set of plates together for us leading to my proposal and ultimately the most important and greatest night of my life! We have had special experiences at Jackys and I hope that continues.

February 6, 2016|service ?|2|my sushi order got screwed up big time waiter did not know the difference between sushi nigiri and sashimi was, so the offer from the management was that the tip was included for a over $ 506.00 bill since we where 11 people, not satisfactory to me who paid the bill, but that was not my first bad experience in a Asian food restaurant.

There was a large party with many kids waiting to be seated and we wanted to be away form noise since we were celebrating our engagement with another couple. We were seated in a back room that was a lot more quiet than the rest of the restaurant. We had a great table overlooking the river away from a big party with children. We loved it!

January 30, 2016|not worth it|1|Took over an hour to get food. Waitress left off over half of our order and then we had to wait longer. Noisy. Average quality of food.
January 30, 2016|Excellent as usual. Love  this place!|5|Excellent as usual. Love this place!
January 17, 2016|Great food at even greater prices|4|This place had a great ambience, friendly staff, and their prix fix menu was delicious and very sumptuous. would definitely recommend for lunch or dinner! As an added bonus, they have free valet parking after 5pm!!

I have to admit, I was quite impressed. The food was excellent as expected. The service was as good, if not better, than their other locations. What sets the waterfront location apart is the decor and view - both are stunning. I will definitely add Jacky's Waterfront to my short list of favorites in the downtown area.
January 9, 2016|Too costlyand too much food|3|Our server did not tell us that the size of the entrees were meant to share. So we got way too many dishes. We wasted a lot of food and payed too much for what we needed. Our waiter should have guided us. The food was ok. The location was great and so was the ambience. But its really the food that should come first,and it was some what bland.
January 9, 2016|love this place|5|Food was excellent. The service was exceptional. The server went above and beyond to have them make something that was no longer on the menu. I love that they a lot of tables that cam seat six or more people. I would recommend this place for everyone!!!
January 7, 2016|First time here.|4|Our lunch at Jackys was very enjoyable. The food was very good, the ambiance was very nice. Our waiter was excellent. We would definitely return to Jackys again.

December 15, 2015|Great Food and Service|5|My family and I go to Jacky's often because the food is excellent and the service is always top notch. Eating outside in the summer is one of my favorite things to do and on colder days the upscale and tasteful decor inside is exceptional. I highly recommend Jacky's.
December 9, 2015|Business holiday lunch a success|4|Table of 6 for lunch, overlooking Waterplace!! Excellent food choices to satisfy everyone! Festive lighting and ambience. Great service! Love it!
November 7, 2015|Go|5|Very pretty inside. Great location. Great menu selections. The lobster lettuce wraps were delicious. My husband had the duck lettuce wraps and loved them too. We also had chicken wings which were a nice portion and really good.

October 24, 2015|Excellent Special Dinner or Splurge|5|We started with well made martinis (the Asian pear is great) and had Oysters from the Raw Bar and Shrimp Cocktail which were both fresh and excellent choices. We had the little necks also, but they were small. We'd also recommend the Shanghai Noodle, Shrimp Lo Mein, and the Steak and Jumbo Shrimp special (everyone's favorite)!!! We could have gotten an amazing meal without breaking the bank, but it was a wonderful splurge night with great service and ambiance!
October 23, 2015|Delicious and unique|5|We were in Providence for one night. Jacky's was recommended and we were not disappointed. In a foodie town, you have to do something to stand out. Jacky's had a great assortment of Asian dishes that I had not seen before, and I have eaten a lot of Asian food! Especially good were some great sushi combos. Great spot. Very convenient to downtown, Brown, RISD.
October 19, 2015|Spectacular View and Delicious fusion rolls|4|"The view of Providence downtown from Jacky's is outstanding and makes the city look magical. The service is attentive and the fusion rolls are divine. From easy valet service to many options to select from Asian cuisine, Jacky's has become a ""go-to-place"" to enjoy dining with friends."
October 18, 2015|Wouldn't Go Back|2|nice location for a restaurant but the food was just mediocre at best. soups were good, but sushi and Chinese dish we ordered were just fair.
October 17, 2015|Tasty|5|Great restaurant. Found it on Trip Advisor. We went for a late lunch, so the restaurant was pretty empty. Therefore, can't vouch for the ambiance and service when it is crowded. Took our waiter's advice on a few selection and also picked a few of our own. Everything we ate was EXCELLENT!
October 11, 2015|Jacky's was great. We had a table with a...|5|Jacky's was great. We had a table with a beautiful view of the city. The apps and Wanton soup were delish as was the general tsaos chicken.
October 2, 2015|Dinner at Jacky's Waterplace Restaurant|5|Dinner was delicious, food was nicely presented, hot and delivered in a timely fashion. (We did not feel rushed). Wait staff was attentive without being pushy. I would definitely go back!
September 26, 2015|Love Jacky's Waterplace!|5|Always have a great experience at Jacky's Water place. The d√©cor is beautiful and the food and drinks are outstanding! A little pricey but well worth it.
September 26, 2015|Great for Waterfire nights|5|Make reservations early for Waterfire nights. Food is excellent...mostly seafood and sushi. Extensive menu. Beautiful d√©cor. Step right outside for the basin where all the boats are docked and the view is beautiful. One of the best parts is free valet parking at the restaurant for the night. So convenient.
September 26, 2015|Amazing food, seriously, the entire menu...|5|Amazing food, seriously, the entire menu is outstanding! Even more important, the staff is wonderful. There was an incident tonight where a women at the table next to us doubled over in pain, it looked pretty serious. The GM and waiter ran right over to her and minimized the scene as much as they could, getting right down on the floor to ask what she would like for them to do. I was completely blown away by their attentiveness, professionalism, and grace.
September 26, 2015|Steph was a FABULOUS server.....unobtrus...|4|Steph was a FABULOUS server.....unobtrusive, yet perfectly attentive for our Waterfire date night dinner. She made the entire experience more than pleasurable, and should be commended for her professionalism and excellent service. Our lounge table had a great view of the Waterfire lighting, however the food was less than desirable. The tempura roll appetizer was beautifully presented but was very oily. The salted edamame are addictive and delicious. My pineapple fried rice was a huge portion and pretty tasty. My boyfriend's duck breast entree seemed to have been just thrown onto the plate, small portion for the price and the duck itself was chewy and had an odd, off putting taste. Almost tasted as if the duck was freezer burnt. I have eaten here for 3 years for Waterfire and the drinks and edamame are tasty staples but the entrees always seem to disappoint. It seems because they know the restaurant is in a fabulous location for Waterfire viewing, they can skimp on the quality of entrees because they know the money will roll in. The only saving grace this year was Steph, our server, who made our entire night extremely memorable. If I return next year, it will be for appetizers and drinks only.
September 22, 2015|Nice ambiance and good service.|3|Beautiful restaurant with free valet parking which is great. My friend ordered a medium rare steak which was overcooked. I ordered sushi which was okay. I would try it again to see if I have better luck with the food. It would be a good place to have a romantic dinner.
Dined on September 19, 2015|Nice to see great customer service|5|The restaurant manager took special care to find a table with a nice view of the city for a special occasion upon request. The food was outstanding quality and for downtown Providence, the pricing was more than reasonable. The complimentary valet parking makes this a sure fire place to return to again and again. Really can't say enough about the quality of service from the manager, to the hostess, to the waiter to the valet parking attendants - not to mention the quality and portions of food. Very nice to see that some establishments understand what makes a successful establishment. Thanks for a very nice evening!
September 19, 2015|Great Ladies Night|5|Overall was excellent. Unfortunately they had prepared an outdoor table for us and we had to wait a little while for an inside table but once seated we had an excelled view of the city. Food and service were great as always. My girlfriends and I love to go here for our sushi fix.
September 18, 2015|Consistently Great!!|5|Love the Asian Pear Martini!! Large menu - from Sushi and Chinese food to American with a flare!! Great place to have dinner before the PPAC show. It was a nice night to walk across the city and we were able to leave our car in the complimentary valet parking.
September 12, 2015|Granderf67|5|Have eaten at Jackys Waterplace several times. Food eclectic and well prepared. Large selection of sushi. Extensive wine list and impeccable service.
September 12, 2015|Great menu, loved the food|5|We were able to get reservations through Open Table on a Water Fire night - which is not easy to do when the restaurant is on the river. There were 5 of us. We were seated right away. Our server was fun and attentive. The menu has lots to choose from and the food was delicious. We had a roll to share as an appetizer, then ordered a variety of beef and seafood dishes. Everyone was very happy with their selection and with the experience as a whole. We would ALL definitely return - and plan to!

September 4, 2015|Mixed Feelings|3|Loved the decor, ambiance and city views. Fusion sushi rolls were tasty but the prawn entree and chicken with noodles were just ok. Prawns looked cobbled together with sauce and peppers which I could have gotten anywhere. Chicken and noodles just didn't have much flavor. The service was very uneven as needed to ask for water, soy sauce frequently. Our server while pleasant wasn't on her game that evening. A complimentary birthday slice was a nice touch. Interactions with the manager were pleasant. Not certain I would rush to get back based on the value you get for the $$ spent.
August 29, 2015|Birthday River Fire|5|Great Experience. Staff was accomodating. Upon confirming reservation I informed the hostess we were coming in for a special birthday and requested a table with a view of the waterfire festivities and was told they'd do their best as it was a busy Saturday. They went above and beyond. Atmosphere and food was spot on. Our server, Andrew, was knowledgeable, polite, friendly, and professional and assisted us in making our entree choices and we were very satisfied and full. Great overall experience and have already made recommendations to friends.
August 29, 2015|Great Food and Service|5|I have been to Jacky's Waterplace restaurant a number of times and it is always fantastic. I highly recommend dining outside on an evening when there is a Waterfire.
August 28, 2015|Jackey's is awesome|5|The staff there try to go above and beyond for you. They made all my wishes come true (except making me rich) . I felt like royalty. It's very nice inside.
August 25, 2015|This was my first time at Jacky's Waterp...|5|This was my first time at Jacky's Waterplace Restaurant. I enjoyed everything about it......the ambiance, food, service and even the valet parking. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
August 23, 2015|Love the place|5|I just overall think this place is very nice one of my favorite restaurants. Wouldn't trade.
August 14, 2015|Outstanding find|5|We were looking for a new place that was different than traditional seafood ands steak. This was it. The menu is Asian but very smart and was of superior quality. The chicken fried rice and the beef dish was outstanding. Service was really good. I found the process reasonable and the valet really helps in downtown.
August 14, 2015|Not worth it|3|We had been for a party before and thought the place was pretty and would be nice for a romantic night out. We were wrong. There were many empty tables, but the place was so loud we felt like we had to yell at each other over the table. Service was ok, but not what we expect for the prices and location of the place. Prices are high for the quality you are getting. If you have an allergy you can forget about them putting any sauce/seasoning on your food, which makes for a plain meal I could have prepared at home :( The place is beautiful inside and the views are nice, but we will not be going back since that is all this place has going for it. Quite disappointing.
August 7, 2015|Would recommend|4|Overall a great experience. Would recommend. Great specialty drinks Ambiance is amazing. Great date place

July 3, 2015|Great Restaurant|4|Jacky's is a wonderful restaurant with wonderful Sushi, fine ambiance, and tasty Main courses. Love going there.
June 25, 2015|Great service and good food|4|Overall this was a very good experience. The service was very good and food was served promptly. The sushi was good but the service and location was better than the food.
June 22, 2015|Jacky's Waterplace Disappoints Again|3|After a bad experience with Jacky's Waterplace back in March, I was not looking forward to going there again recently for a business lunch. I tried to keep an open mind but once again I was not impressed. I made a reservation for a party of 15 (only 12 showed up). We arrive to Jacky's promptly at our time of 11:45. The table was not yet ready but folks in our party were still arriving. We were seated in a private room with a table pressed up against the wall. The last two seats were not usable as they were leaning up against a pole. Good thing not all my guests arrived. Anyway, our waiter arrives and isn't the most personable. We ask if we can order an assortment of appetizers (like a pu pu platter - hardly a unique question in an Asian restaurant) and he looks at us like we have three heads. Anyway, appetizers were good and came out pretty quickly. Our lunch orders on the otherhand not so good. One person in our party had ordered chicken and broccoli. When our waiter came out with beef and broccoli and noone claimed it (as noone ordered it) he was almost argumentative about it. Anyway, we received our lunches in waves. A third of us got our meals and then ten minutes later another third of us and then ten minutes later the rest of us got served. Regarding the food quality of our lunches, I didn't hear any complaints though I can tell you the chicken in my lemongrass was chewy and fatty. Thanks again Jacky's!
June 13, 2015|My mistake was having expectations that ...|1|"My mistake was having expectations that were too high. Lower your expectations to just ""ok"" and you will get everything you want. #1 - fish bones in the sushi. I'm not kidding. The service was rushed. It was a busy night. That's understandable - but sushi grade fish and quality sushi chefs would VERY allow fish bones in sushi. They did not deduct that item from our bill even after I showed them the bone. #2 - arguing with dining guests about their reservations. We arrived exactly on time. All members of the party were present. They acknowledged our reservation then made us wait 30 minutes during which time they confused our reservation with two other patrons. They made no apologies. #3 - wait staff: Inattentive. Courses arrived haphazard. Items incomplete. Just sad. They did acknowledge this but justified their inadequacy by saying it was a busy ""Waterfire"" night. Why should patrons suffer when the business is enjoying the profits of a busy night?"
May 29, 2015|Always a hit|5|Jacky's Waterplace is fantastic. Great atmosphere inside, great view outside, food is always wonderful and so is the service.
May 27, 2015|Lovely presentation but bland food|2|Jack'y Waterplace is a very attractive restaurant, the service was good and the food was presented well but the dishes were very bland, even those labeled as spicy. Nothing was bad, but when we go out for Asian food or sushi we're looking for more interesting tastes - not very spicy but distinctive - and these weren't. So, if you like generic Asian food in a nice environment, go, but we won't be back.

May 21, 2015|Great food and service|1|The food here continues to be excellent. Fusion-type rolls are very interesting and a must. Extensive menus appeal to all kinds of taste, but be prepared to take some time to study! The service is impeccable and makes for a very nice evening. Carpeted floor makes the otherwise full restaurant quiet and there is not need to shout across the table to talk to the dinner companion, like one needs to do at too many restaurants today.
May 15, 2015|Service|5|We enjoy this restaurant often. It was my birthday and our server , Eric, was great. We had an issue with our wine choice, and he understood the problem and took care of it. Thanks Eric.
May 13, 2015|Will Return, Good not Exceptional,but has Promise!|3|Came for dinner midweek with a small group of four. The location, ease of parking and extraordinary views make this place a winner. A few items not quite up to expectations though. Greeting upon entrance to restaurant was rude. Stood with my dinner date at front reception for a solid 5 minutes before we were greeted; hostess and manager engaged in ongoing discussion with one another, made no eye contract or offered a greeting, and please wait a moment type of thing. Food is good, but not great, although the Chinese broccoli was a standout, as well as the Nime Chow. Pan Asian Fusion can be challenging to pull off for entire menu, and Jacky‚Äôs was no exception to this quandary. We sat for a while waiting for check and/or dessert offering. At the prices, service should be more prompt. Music was loud and pop like, not for everyone. However, overall this is a great place for group to order and share a variety of dishes, offers a fantastic view of the city and with one or two tweaks would be a standout experience! Will definitely come back.
May 10, 2015|Looks Great, but don't judge a book by it's cover.|2|The ambiance was terrific and the view out of the windows of the Providence sky line was also amazing. Restaurant was fairly empty, not sure why it took 30 minutes to get our meals? Manager was very unaccommodating and borderline rude. Not sure I'd go back.
May 10, 2015|Always A pleasure!|5|I have dined here multiple times over the past several years and have never been disappointed. The food is always excellent but it is staff that make the restaurant distinguishable. I highly recommend the restaurant.
May 9, 2015|Inexcusable|1|"We had a 9:30 DINNER reservation and had provided a telephone number to be reached. When we arrived we were told that there was a private event going on and they ""would not cook any entrees, no fried rice, no noodles"". We were offered ""sushi, appetizers or something fried"". I am vegan so this was less than acceptable. No apology, no advance telephone call, just plain rude!! We left and will not be returning AND we will pass the word to others!!!"
May 5, 2015|Beautiful place with a great view, howev...|2|Beautiful place with a great view, however the food was terrible. I ordered chicken in Peanut sauce, the chicken looked like it had been pounded flat , the pieces were huge and the sauce tasted awful. My friend didn't eat her meal either , same thing she said it tasted terrible... I didn't even eat mine..The chefs in the kitchen got into an argument, we could hear them yelling at each other very loudly in Chinese .... We have eaten at many of the resturants in Providence in the past 8 years of travel there, but will never go to Jacky's again.
April 15, 2015|great|4|Good food, service and amazing view and atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!
April 3, 2015|Amazing.|5|The staff was exceptional and the food was even better. Best sushi I've ever had
March 30, 2015|Great Sushi at a Reasonable Price!|5|Conveniently on the water front, this is a great place to go for a romantic dinner or just a night out. Their sashimi is amazing, but even if raw fish isn't for you there is plenty on the menu that will tickle your taste buds.
March 21, 2015|this is the spot!|5|Went to Jackys with a group of 5 and had one of the best dining experiences in a while. Service was great and we ordered so many kinds of sushi and everything was delicious. Can't wait to get back there!
March 21, 2015|Excellent fodd and service!|5|Looking forward to having dinner here again, especially when Waterfire is scheduled!
March 13, 2015|Fresh and beautiful|5|We went to Jacky's specifically for the sushi. Not only is it fresh and delicious but it is the most visually attractive around. The service was attentive without being intrusive. It is a little pricy but worth it.
February 14, 2015|Valentine's Dinner for 3|4|My wife, daughter and I had our family Valentine's Day dinner this year at Jackie's on Saturday and we were not disappointed. The menu is varied so there are tons of choices especially sushi and they had a Special Valentine's Day menu which I really liked. I had the General Tso's chicken with brown rice which was excellent. My wife had a sushi platter and she enjoyed every bite. And my daughter had the steak tips with Teriyaki and rice and she also loved it. Desserts were limited but my coconut ice cream was very good. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and the food was great!
February 12, 2015|Lovely night|5|My book group dined here on a very snowy night last week. It was a great choice. Ten women were happy - no easy feat! The food, service, valet ... all excellent. We will return.
Dined on January 31, 2015|Almost like being there|5|"If you can't get to Asia, Jacky's is the next best thing! Great Peking Duck. The young chow fried rice is ""exactly what you would have while eating in Hong Kong!. It's a must try for all. We go there at least once a month!"
January 6, 2015|Great place overlooking waterfire downtown|5|it was a snowy night and waterfire was lit for inauguration so it was a great view. The food and service were excellent. Would definitely go back with more friends!
January 3, 2015|Awesome place!|5|Great service! Server made us feel welcome and had a good sense of humor. Food served in a timely manner and delicious.
January 3, 2015|So good!|5|Had a casual spur of the moment evening with a friend at Jacky's and, as usual, had a great experience. Ordered the crab rangoons and nime chow to start, then firecracker and torpedo rolls + fried rice for dinner, and tempura green tea ice cream to finish. Phenomenal! Service was spot on, too...just the right amount of attention from our server who had a great knowledge of the menu. If you're looking for sushi and a great dinning experience in Providence, this is the place to go.
December 31, 2014|Favorite Chinese Restaurant|5|Jackies has always been a favorite of ours. However, this particular locations food seems to be the best! We celebrated New Years Eve dinner with our family including an 18month old and was very happy with the food and patience of our server Eric. We will definitely be visiting this location again in the near future.
December 28, 2014|An overall great experience !|5|Everything was great. The Host Jessica was very friendly and helpful. The timing and presentation of sushi and other apps were perfect. The server Halle was attentive and explained every entree well. Every entree was presented well. Halle surprised us with complementary cheese cake for the birthday twins. Overall the experience was outstanding and made our night out special. We were first timers and will return.
December 25, 2014|Wonderful - again ~|5|This was my 2nd time enjoying a beautiful and delicious meal at Jacky's at WPP. Great food and artistic presentation. Servings are generous. I definitely plan to return soon. First visit was romantic dinner for two. This time we were a party of nine. On this occasion, our very enjoyable experience included a round table with a lazy susan on top so that sharing was easy. Highly recommended for anyone who likes Asian cuisine - a wide range and all was delicious.

December 23, 2014|Went for lunch with a business assoiate ...|4|Went for lunch with a business assoiate for our usual Christmas-time get-together. Although I've been to the new North Providence location, I hadn't been to Providence previously. The restaurant is beautiful, nice ambiance, some good lunch choices. Anxious to return for dinner. It would be great during a Waterfire event!
December 21, 2014|Quiet Sunday Lunch|4|As usual, the food was very good, but the service was exceptional! Not only did our waiter fulfill our every request, he was also anticipatory! My brother remarked that he liked this particular vegetable served on the side of an appetizer, and our waiter brought him a dish of them! This gentleman was a class act! Thanks for taking care of us!
December 6, 2014|The food and service is fantastic!|5|The ambience is very beautiful and the service is great. The food is wonderful and I've gone for my birthday dinner twice. I especially like the steak tips, though all of the dishes I've tried have been great. The portions are good, too, and they are good at accommodating food allergies. Overall. I highly recommend Jackey's!
December 5, 2014|The best dinner|5|The decor was fitting for the restaurant. It was elegant and romantic. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was attentive to all of our needs. The food and drinks were absolutely great.
November 28, 2014|I go to Jacky's all the time and love it...|3|"I go to Jacky's all the time and love it. This past visit I was disappointed with the food. I only wanted the lettuce wraps and wonton soup. The soup was cold and the wonton freezing and the ""wraps"" were really filling dumped on top of lettuce. I've had them in the past here, and they were tightly wrapped. Needless to say it was a messy ordeal. The other people in my party were happy, as they all had sushi which looked beautiful. I will still go back because it is a beautiful restaurant and has the best view in the city."
November 22, 2014|Best sushi I ever had!|5|Jacky's was a really great experience! I made a reservation on opentable and when we arrived the place was packed, but we were seated right away. The waiter was very attentive, accommodating and helpful with choices on the menu. We had the best sushi of our lives! So fresh and clean and the presentation was impeccable! I will definitely go back and I will certainly recommend this to all friends, family and fellow opentable members.
November 22, 2014|Good place to eat before a show|4|"Service was quick and attentive. Sushi was cold and fresh. Nice variety of rolls. We'll be going back to try the ""cooked"" side of the menu next. The plates coming by us looked and smelled tasty. Valet took any parking worries away and was quick."
November 7, 2014|Excellent place|5|Ideal place for a special occasion, great food and drinks. Wide variety on the menu.
November 1, 2014|Authentic Asian|5|I've travelled to Asia extensively and Jacky's is definitely the next best thing to being there. Fabulous Peking Duck! Excellent Tempura, terrific Sushi! The best!
October 28, 2014|Great service|5|The food was very good and the service was excellent! While making a reservation on line, I mentioned in the comments section that we were celebrating my husband's promotion. When we arrived the hostess congratulated him and at the end of our meal he was presented with a beautiful complimentary dessert. I appreciate so much that they took it upon themselves to do that. It made our celebration that much more memorable.
October 28, 2014|Great group experience|5|I have a group of 8-10 friends that meets for dinner once a month, and has done so for more than thirty years. In the past we have visited and been pleased with the Galaxie restaurants. Since Jacky's Waterplace opened we have dined there several times. It is slightly more pricey than the Galaxies but is well worth the extra for the experience, ambience, and convenient location in downtown Providence. It is such fun to order a variety of dishes to share. As always, we especially appreciate that Peking duck does not have to be ordered in advance, and is as delicious as ever. I believe Jacky's is probably among our group's top three favorite Rhode Island restaurants.
October 25, 2014|Awesome!|5|Decided on this restaurant because of the great reviews and the location to WaterFire. Did not disappoint! The food was incredible and the service was even better. We felt important and valued and that means so much to me.
October 18, 2014|Delicious Dining|5|This is just the greatest place for any occasion. The food and service has always been amazing!
October 18, 2014|Romantic Dinner|5|We dined at Jacky's prior to the RI Philharmonic concert. Had a very romantic dinner, two of us enjoyed a private table. Each course was artfully prepared and served. Delicious seafood egg drop soup, outstanding sushi and entrees. Definitely will be back for another special meal. Highly recommended!
October 14, 2014|Spectacular Sushi|5|Some of the best sushi rolls that you'll have. Great ambiance, good service, reasonable wine bottle pricing and overall, a great experience.
October 11, 2014|Great Birthday Celebration!|5|We had a party of 14 for my sister's birthday party and the restaurant accommodated us beautifully by giving us a private room and a very attentive waiter. Food was consistently very good. Everyone...EVERYONE at the table had a great meal. How often does that happen?!? We were there for Water Fire and enjoyed the view from our table. High recommend. Will definitely come back!
October 10, 2014|Dinner before a show|4|"This was my second visit to Jacky's Waterplace. Both times the food was great, the ambience is nice and the view of Waterplace is beautiful. My complaint is with the hostess and waitress. Both times, when ordering the ""house wine"", the wait staff serves the most expensive wine on the wine list. During my first visit, the hostess refused to seat us at a window table for a 4:30pm reservation. I had made the reservation a month ahead of time and called twice to confirm a window table. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took asking to see the manager to be seated at a window table. When we left, there were still plenty of empty tables."
October 4, 2014|I came here for the first time this past...|5|I came here for the first time this past weekend with a few friends for a birthday, and I was blown away at the quality of the food, the service, and the ambiance of the establishment. Excellent experience all around. The restaurant is located just in front of where the WaterFire events in Providence take place, which must be beautiful to look out to at night when they are taking place. Our waiter was friendly and provided us with great service! I Also loved the complementary valet parking which was a major relief that I didn't have to worry about parallel parking into a tiny space a couple blocks away like usual with inner city dining. I highly recommend Jacky's Waterplace to anyone who enjoys great tasting, high quality Asian food!
September 27, 2014|Awesome!|5|Awesome food, drinks and atmosphere! I've been here for a romantic dinner and for a night out with the girls. Jackie's is great for all occasions!
September 27, 2014|great food , love the place, my wife fav...|5|great food , love the place, my wife favorite place, eat and see the water fires, had outstanding night- thank for the table, will go back again,
September 26, 2014|Great place for lunch|4|I took a group here for lunch and it was great. Food was very good and ambience was fantastic.
September 20, 2014|My friends and I enjoyed a very relaxing...|4|My friends and I enjoyed a very relaxing and enjoying evening at Jacky's Waterplace. We sit outside on the deck which was not as noisy as inside. Our waitress was very pleasant and enjoyed joking with us, but at the beginning at little slow, in that it took us awhile to get our drinks. The vegetable pad thai was very good, flat iron steak with Chinese broccoli also excellent. My girlfriend and I had the prawns dish with varied vegetables in a mild, light sauce. I would definitely order that again. A sushi dish was also ordered and did not disappoint in presentation or taste. The four of us agreed that we would definitely come back to Jacky's.
September 20, 2014|Stick with the sushi|2|My husband loves sushi and I don't, but we gave it a try because the menu had a lot of variety. We had early reservations and as we were being seated we walked through the staff all sitting around eating edamame (very unprofessional). The cloth chairs were filthy and the window sills had dust and grime on them. I ordered soup and my husband ordered sushi for our appetizers. The soup was nice but way too large and the sushi was excellent. We both ordered an entr√©e with steak, requested medium. They both came well done. My husband's was very fatty and his daikon radish was so raw he could not bite into it. The waitress seemed annoyed to have to serve us throughout the whole dinner. This place is fine as long as you only go for sushi.
September 20, 2014|hip place, great view, good food|4|nice staff, very good choices. we have noodles, apps and sushi and we liked it all. nice view on the water, good for a group or a date. modern dishes but also classics. the DUCK appetizer is a great way to sample some decadence and a Chinese classic.
September 19, 2014|Great food and service|4|We had excellent service here and lived the food. We're vegetarian and odered cucumber and avocado rolls, veggie spring rolls and the Pad Thai without the egg . All were delicious!
September 19, 2014|Food and Sushi consistently good|4|Can get crowded with large parties on a weekend night so the kitchen can get quite busy. But worth the wait. I find the good and Sushi consistently yummy!!!
September 12, 2014|Great Local fancy Asian|5|Jacky's puts Pf Changs to shame, though I like Changs as well (for a chain restaurant). I enjoy Jacky's every time I go.
August 29, 2014|Nice Dinner|4|I had nime chow and the crab & salmon sashimi. Excellent choices, very fresh. Service was cheerful, but moderately slow. Cocktails did not come until the waiter was reminded, and just before the appetizers arrived. Also not made to my companion's specifications. Actually, the bartender seemed tired and not friendly. Beautiful atmosphere, very elegant and cosmopolitan. This was my first visit after 8 PM, and I was very disappointed to see several children there, which kind of spoiled the mood. Still, highly recommended.
August 23, 2014|perfect meal with waterfire|4|We were visiting from out of town to see waterfire, what a great find. They have windows overlooking the river and basin. We could be outside and experience the festival and they texted us exactly when the take was ready. Service was a tad slow but understandable on such a busy night, and frankly we did not mind given they accommodated our window request. I'm normally skeptical of places that offer up multiple cuisines under one roof, but it worked here. The sushi was fresh and well crafted, the Chinese food was excellent also. I didn't attempt dessert but my daughter said the banana tempura chocolate thing hit the spot.
August 23, 2014|glitzy decor|3|This restaurant is reasonable but is rather over the top in its glitzy decor. No complaints about anything but probably not somewhere we would return to. The menu is also quite pricy.
August 23, 2014|Jackie's Waterfront|5|I had made my reservation for 8 at 4:30pm 2 months ahead of time because it was a Waterfire night. I called 4 times to confirm the reservation and to request to sit near a window. I was told we couldn't eat outside because they didn't allow parties larger than 6 outside. We were the first people in the restaurant and were told there were no window seats available! There was nobody else in the restaurant! I reminded them I had made the reservation 2 months ago and they asked us if we wanted to sit outside after I had been told several times we couldn't. They wanted to put us in a small room in the back of the restaurant with no windows. Finally, they sat us at a window. When we left, the hostess was rude and wouldn't even acknowledge us.
August 15, 2014|We always have a good experience. Food a...|3|We always have a good experience. Food and menu are excellent. Their wait staff leaves a little to be desired, not top notch. Red wines by the glass that are offered are terrible.
Dined on August 11, 2014|Fabulous|4|My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time. The food was great, the service was wonderful. The only thing that would deter me from going back is the price of each item. The cost is almost double what you would pay even on the east side.
August 11, 2014|I held a business/ lunch meeting and the...|4|I held a business/ lunch meeting and the atmosphere was favorable for such a meeting. The food was wonderful and decor is beautiful! I would go back for business or personal dining experience.
August 9, 2014|Delicious, but disappointing|5|This was our second time here. As always, great food and service. However, my Open Table request for a window table was not fulfilled. It was Water Fire night, but I requested it so far ahead. If you are going to ask for requests on the site, then you should do your best to fulfill them. To top it off, after our wonderful meal, we handed in a discount card from The Marriott, which was supposed to be redeemed for one appetizer or glass of wine per entree (up to a $12 value). We had four meals, and they only took off one appetizer. After I told her we ate here before and got four, showed her the wording and told her we got 2 appetizers at Zooma, they took off one more --still not all four (2 appetizers and 2 wines). Disappointed.
August 9, 2014|FABULOUS!!!|5|I can't tell you the last time I ate in the city of Providence...I try to avoid the city at all costs..it was so easy to get there...but at Jackie's everything was perfect..immediate easy valet parking...the staff, the service, the food, the atmosphere, food presentation, our table (#38 to be exact) ....after our dinner we were able to go outside and have a spectacular view of the waterfires.......we will be visiting again.....oh forgot to mention using open table for our reservations was convenient also.........thank you
August 9, 2014|fantastic experience|5|This was my second visit to Jackys. We were celebrating my father's 50th birthday. Jacky's truly made it special. They seated us by a window overlooking the river, and were perfectly attentive. The food was incredible, beautiful presentation. What a great day!
August 9, 2014|Mixed|4|Been here before, really liked ambience, food, service. This time, service was very slow & we were only one of 3 tables there, with only 4-5 people at bar. Service would have been rated lower except they were very accomodating when we wanted to switch tables twice because of the sun - although they shouldn't have seated us in way of the sun the first place. The French crunch roll was outstanding.
August 7, 2014|Really off, off, off night - why??|1|"I have always enjoyed Jacky's (have been to this location multiple times and regularly get Sushi from their location on Metacom Ave.), but they were WAY OFF on the Thursday night we dined there. They were ""down a bartender"" which delayed our drinks 10+ minutes. Then the blender was broken, so some drinks couldn't be served. Then they were out of mint, so other drinks could not be served. Then drinks finally appeared and one of them had an insect in it. At this point we waited through the rest of dinner for the next thing to go wrong. Really spoiled it. And I think there was some loose tile outside bathroom, which wobbled, and you felt like the place was slowly being neglected. Would not recommend if we only had this outing to go by."
July 31, 2014|Love the sushi|5|we had a great waitress and the sushi and sashemi were top notch! I ask for a quiet area for conversation and we were placed in a area away from the crowded a parts of the restaurant with a nice view of the river.
July 28, 2014|Service Issues|4|My only objection to our evening was that my appetizer was forgotten, so it arrived late to the table. While everyone was still eating appetizer the main courses were brought to the table and sat for a significant period of time.
July 26, 2014|Great Food!|5|My husband does not like Japanese or Chinese food and there were more than enough choices for him to choose from! Service on the drinks a little slow.....very clean....enjoyed it all....prices....$$$...especially the drinks!
July 26, 2014|enjoyed food and ambience|4|We enjoyed the food, especially liked the flat iron steak with asparagus and the oriental fried rice with chicken, beef and shrimp. The decor of the restaurant is very nice. Service was friendly and relatively quick.
July 22, 2014|Awesome!!|5|My date and I were looking for a restaurant with an intimate setting, good Sushi, good drinks, outside seating and nice decor. Jacky's Waterplace has all that and much more! Our waiter was super friendly and funny. I definitely recommend this restaurant. It is perfectly situated during Waterfire evenings as well.
July 19, 2014|Everything is wonderful.         ul|5|Decor beautiful wonderful food great for special occasions
July 18, 2014|pvd experience|5|Delicious cuisine! This was our first experience and it was exceptionally worthwhile. Excellent staff, food, scenery and overall experience!
July 17, 2014|Very accommodating staff members. Attent...|3|Very accommodating staff members. Attentive service. Went for the Sashimi and sushi exclusively. The menu caters to Americans and offers many Asian options, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese. It is a challenge to offer that many options and execute each well. Nice but not for the connoisseur of Sushi.
July 15, 2014|Excellent place to dine|5|Never disappointed with Jacky's Waterplace. Always want to go back there all the time. Recommend people to try this amazing restaurant. Keep up the good work guys. The people work there are very friendly.
July 12, 2014|Great food and atmosphere!|4|Had dinner with three friends before watching the basin lighting at WaterFire. The food was delicious (had the Pad Thai and a Tuna/Avocado roll). The martinis were generous (Perfect Passion and Pomegranate). The atmosphere is the ideal combination of energetic, yet serene. It really is the best place to dine before WaterFire. However, my friends and I spent over $200 and felt very rushed by the wait staff, which kind of isn't cool when you're spending that kind of $$ and clearly going to tip well. We were only there for two hours and had appetizers, two drinks each, and full entrees. Settle down, dude. Other than that, nice experience!
July 9, 2014|Great menu selections|4|Something for everybody. Unfortunately, the last time I was there, the waiter seemed to go missing and we had to walk to the front to ask for our check.
July 8, 2014|Weekday lunch|2|Great ambience, but the service was poor. The waiter did not know the menu.
July 3, 2014|Good Food, Nice People|4|At dinner, the service, the view, the ambience and the food were all great. Been here several times and it is all very good. Great and Fresh Sushi.
June 30, 2014|stekel|5|Jacky's is a great place to dine! The food is fresh and the service is great. If you love sushi, this is the place to go. The sushi chefs are tru artists!
June 28, 2014|Review of Jacky's|4|We all had sushi except for one. He ordered lobster surf and turf and unfortunately his meal arrived very late while the rest of us were already almost finished. The manager became aware and offered a round of drinks. Overall though sushi was great.
June 28, 2014|city night|4|went to Jacky's on waterfire night, great look at the city and the lighting along the river. Service a little slow, but they were very busy. Great drinks. We asked hostess for a seat at the window and she said she would try her best, she did come through with that, very nice. Food was good.
June 28, 2014|Not the best food in Twon|2|We went to Jackies on a Saturday to be near the water/fire event. The place is attractive and the veiw was really nice. All the food that we had was rather pedestrian and far from authentic. The service was attenative and we had a good time, but for the price we were disappointed and will most likely not return. Perhaps for visitors its ok.
June 27, 2014|Great Asian food with a view|4|We had a nice dinner overlooking the Riverwalk before a free concert. The waiter was very accomodating for our food needs (vegetarian and gluten and dairy free). The pad thai was fresh, the summer rolls were wrapped right, and the sushi roll was great!
June 27, 2014|foodieinpa|5|"From the valet parking greeting on thru the dinner service, this place is a winner. We had the won-ton soup and the shrimp lemongrass soup - both delicious. We had the Peking duck which had a crispy crust, tender meat, and minimum fat - another winner. We tried the coconut shrimp which was greaseless, crispy, and not too sweet served with a mango sauce that hit the right degrees of hotness and again, not sweet. We finished with green tea and ginger ice cream, both refreshing. Our server was well informed on all the menu choices and the preparation, very attentive without being intrusive. The location is easy to get to and has great views of the river - the d√©cor is lovely. Definitely a ""come-back"" place."

June 7, 2014|Fun & Tasty Get-Together Spot|5|Six of us met on Saturday, where we enjoyed great appetizers at the bar, watched the Belmont Stakes and had great sushi, sashimi, cooked beef & cooked chicken. In all, there was something for everyone!!! The service was great as was the atmosphere. We've been here before & will continue to return!!!!!!!
June 2, 2014|Great sushi!|5|Another terrific dinner at Jacky's. A nice touch occurred when the wait staff came to the table to sing happy birthday to my daughter, with a slice of delicious cheesecake. Our 3rd time there, and our third excellent experience.
June 1, 2014|Beautiful Restaurant|4|This was our first time at Jacky's and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The food was very good as well as the service. I noticed that most negative reviews had to do with the service but we did not experience any problems. It was a little expensive compared to most Asian restaurants but the view is worth it. You must try it at least once.
May 25, 2014|Beyond Disappointing|1|Extremely disappointing. Kept a guest without a chair for 15 minutes. Food came to the table completely cold. Manager was relatively unresponsive. For the multiple restaurant errors in a party of 10 the manager took off two vegetables. Never again. No wonder it was the only restaurant which had availability on open table after most had been booked for months due to college graduations.
May 24, 2014|Second time is as good as the first|5|Again I took guests to dinner and I was very impressed as were they. It was a Waterfire Night. It was the perfect spot to watch Waterfires. The restaurant was very busy but it did not negatively effect the service. The wait staff was great and attentive. We received very good suggestions from our waitress and help to suggest wine and drinks to complement our meal. I would highly recommend checking this place out. Wonderful evening.
May 13, 2014|I always feel richer|5|I love going to Jacky's Waterplace because I feel like a different person when I go there. The staff are friendly and helpful, the linens are fantastic and the ambiance is just so rich and distinct. It just feels like a different caliber of restaurant. The food is always fantastic, fresh and prepared the way you ask. There was a slip up this visit though, instead of just Shrimp I got a variety of seafood in my Singapore Noodle. (which I was VERY okay with!) The sushi was fresh and delicious as always. The prices are reasonable for what you receive. All in all I've always had a good experience at this location. The other Jacky's locations pale in comparison.
May 11, 2014|Enchanting Experience|5|This is a beautiful setting for some spectacular food. You can enjoy a variety of appetizers, fun drinks, sushi and full meals while you're surrounded by gorgeous view and elegant decor. Albert, the Manager will make your experiwnce shine.... Love it!
May 9, 2014|Good!|4|It was a really nice place to eat. Food was good and the staff was friendly
May 9, 2014|always a great time and meal|5|Always love going to Jackie's for sushi with friends. We just order a bunch and share. No pressure to get up and leave. Drinks are great too.
May 3, 2014|Always great!|5|"We have been to Jacky's Waterplace many times now and we are ""never"" disappointed. Excellent food, drinks and service."
May 1, 2014|Just Okay/Nothing really stands out|4|Just a plain ordinary meal. Nothing bad, really... Just nothing special either. Valet guys were very nice and friendly.
Dined on April 30, 2014|Great place for friends and family|5|Brought my business associates and had a great time. Food and service was great and the employees bent over backwards to serve.
April 26, 2014|Date night must do|5|We absolutely LOVE Jacky's Waterplace and make a point to go 1-2 (if not more) times a month, we love arriving early to have pre-dinner cocktails with our favorite bar staff so friendly and attentive then off to dinner with our favorite waiter Kenny, always smiling and always going above and beyond. Good company, great staff and awesome food and the best MAI TAI's in the state!!!
April 26, 2014|Worst service ever|1|Went with out of town guests, horror show. We were a party of 4 and my three out of town guests wanted to only go to this restaurant. We were early for our reservation and seated in a booth in front of the servers area. The waitress was prompt and we ordered three appetizers, All was fine until the waitress told us our main course was coming out and she promptly took my friends appetizer plate away while there was still appetizers unfinished on the table. The waitress spilt oil on the table and did not cover it up with a napkin and we sat and watched this oil stain turn into a BP oil slick! She never refreshed our water nor asked if we wanted anymore drinks, then she took my friends plate away while I was still eating. Worst service !!
April 25, 2014|First time|4|This was my first time at Jacky's. I did not have any issues. The valet, host and waiter were all friendly. The sushi was a little pricey, but I found it to be very good. It appears that most of the seating is near a window, which allows for great views.
April 23, 2014|Public rudeness |2|WE were sat at a lovely table at the far end of the dining room with a beautiful view of the Providence skyline in a beautifully scenic dinning room and served equally beautifully prepared 3 course dinner which included soup, sushi. entree and dessert with a bottle of wine. It is a shame that we had not one but two tables next to us that needed to continually play videos on their phones loud enough for all of us to hear. Such thought and work have gone into the dining experience at Jackie's Waterplace Restaurant and it can be cancelled out by the public rudeness of who you might SIT next to. Come on management don't be afraid of saying something and DEMAND the respect that your restaurant deserves !
April 23, 2014|Fantastic Find|5|I have lived in the Providence area for many years and enjoy the fabulous restaurants in the city. I have wanted to try Jacky's but never got around to going. I had some friends coming in from Massachusetts and thought we could meet there. I was concerned because I had not tried it first, but to my surprise it was perfect. We were there at lunch. The service and the ambience was great. The luncheon specials were varied and reasonably priced. We had drinks that were excellently made. We enjoyed our lunch so much we were the only ones there after the lunch crowd left. I have been recommending this restaurant to all my friends. My Massachusetts guests suggested we meet there again for our next meeting.
April 18, 2014|great ambiance|2|Good ambiance, didnt enjoy the food too much. The cocktail that I had gotten was way too strong and undrinkable, wouldn't reccommend the resyurant.
April 13, 2014|B day celebration|4|Took my dtr. for 42nd birthday. she thoroughly enjoyed it.
March 30, 2014|Love this place!! Always great|5|Love this place!! Always great whenever I come!! Will be back soon!!
March 29, 2014|food|4|Hot appetizers are to be hot not cold. Hot duck app was cold sent it back,was still cold. Sent it back again, was taken off bill as it should. Ordered gen. tso's chicken, wanted it spicy, was not even a little spicy. Server was excellent, bad result for food was not his fault. It was my first experience there and I'm not sure i would go back because the kitchen could not follow a servers direction. People pass on their experience and my husband brags about how wonderful this place is. I on the other hand do not agree. Sorry
March 29, 2014|Amazing night out|5|If you like sushi & Asian cuisine then this place is a nice upscale place to consider. Valet parking starts the evening off to a good start. Intimate and fun environment good for romantic evenings and a night out with friends
March 28, 2014|Really?|3|Mine was a party of 2 and we were seated at a booth that seats 6. I might understand if we didn't walk by no less than six (6!!!!!) tables for 2 that were available. Also, the waiter was not very good - among the options for the pad thai were shrimp, beef, chix, seafood etc... I asked what the seafood consisted of and the answer I got was 'shrimp'. I explained that I saw shrimp was one of the choices, but another was seafood and inquired if it was a mix. Answer - no necks. WTF!!! He meant no little necks or any other clams. When I enunciated the word 'mix' again so we would be clear about what I was asking his answer was 'yes - it's all mixed together'. And no, there wasn't too much noise or any other reason to misunderstand me!!!!
March 22, 2014|Delicious & Fresh!|5|Have dined here many times. Never a disappointment. Service great, food is the best!
March 22, 2014|Amazing|5|The portions were HUGE! The food was unbelievable! Definitely going back!
March 22, 2014|Asian Fusion - Yum!|5|Dinner was great - we grabbed an early seating - 445 PM (w/2 kids) and requested to sit by a window - No problem! The sushi was great Lettuce wraps w/ Shrimp great Sticky wings - our 6 year old loved them. Great family dining -
March 20, 2014|Great place!|4|Great sushi and great views! I had never even heard of this place, but it is pretty amazing. Awesome fish tank in the lobby and great panoramic views of the river area. Sushi was very good.. So was the crab rangoon. Very small beer list, but I guess I'm im the minority for ordering a beer at a sushi place.
March 19, 2014|Excellent in nearly every respect|5|The food is always yummy and beautifully presented. The duck, chicken, shrimp, lobster and sushi/sashimi are fabulous. Once, the valet's were not around for roughly 10 minutes. Only happened once.
March 15, 2014|Lovely setting for celebration|3|Beautiful room overlooking the river. It must be spectacular during Waterfire nights. We chose our meal from the Chinese part of the menu. Everything was well prepared, with the exception of the Peking duck which was dried out, as if it had been prepared a few days before. The steak in black pepper sauce and the vegetables were tasty and cooked the way we asked. It was a lovely experience if you are looking for familiar flavors and well done, predictable food.
March 10, 2014|Special Celebration|5|My son wanted Jacky's to celebrate his 18th birthday. We are all huge sushi lovers and feel Jacky's has the best in Providence. I had the spicy yellowtail and it was fabulous. Their presentation is like art. My husband's meal looked like it could have been a floral arrangement-just exquisite. When asked if we would like more at the end of the meal, we shared that we were on our way home to celebrate with desert. Five minutes later, my son is surrounded with the serenading wait staff and a beautiful plate of gelato. What a nice surprise for all of us. We dine at Jacky's 5-6 times a year and it is always a great experience.
March 8, 2014|A dining favorite|5|I have been to Jacky's Waterplace several times and it has been a great experience on each occasion. They offer many selections; the quality is excellent and I always leave feeling satisfied. I definitely recommend it! I
March 8, 2014|One of the best, if not the|5|One of the best, if not the best oriental restaurants in Providence. The food and the service is outstanding
March 7, 2014|Had a great birthday dinner|5|My husband always wants sushi for his birthday dinner. After moving from Brooklyn to Providence 2 years ago, we hadn't found that special birthday sushi restaurant. This year we went to Jacky's and it as perfect! Great ambiance, great food, great service. We'll be back. Oh yes. We will be back.
March 6, 2014|My first time at Jacky's|5|This my first visit to your restaurant. We were a group I five celebrating a friends birthday. The food was fabulous and our waitress couldn't have been nicer. We will definitely be back!
March 5, 2014|Service|3|Took 15 minutes after being seated for a waiter to arrive at our table. The restaurant was only 40% full. Understaffed. One bartender for the entire place.
February 27, 2014|Amazing food and tremendous service|5|The sushi/sashimi were outstanding, presentation was artful, and the service was friendly and very attentive. We're definitely going back. Also saw a gorgeous private dining room. The quality of the fish was second to none, and the serving sizes were extremely generous. Neither my husband nor I could finish.
February 22, 2014|Enjoyed appetizers and drinks|4|Enjoyed appetizers and drinks before the theater. Service was excellent and out waiter Justin made sure we were in and out in time for the show.
February 14, 2014|Dissapointing management|2|It;s a beautiful spot and has great food, but unfortunately management kicked us out of our table after 1.5 hours, even though we had a reservation. Also, had to wait 30 minutes to get car from valet. I will never go back.
February 8, 2014|Awesome Birthday|5|I celebrated my 3 kids birthdays here...food as always was great and well paced...our server was exceptional and very friendly we will keep coming back
February 1, 2014|Nice Night Out|5|This is a great place for a night out with friends or a romantic evening. Great food and ambiance. we did not get to go outside because of the time of year but we will certainly be going back.
January 27, 2014|Date Nigth spot|3|"Good 1st date spot as it is quiet and nicely appointed, you can talk . Next to the river/waterway make it ""romantic"""
January 25, 2014|A great find - but beware of GPS|4|We had a rgeat experience at Jacky's and we'll definitely go back. It was a bit difficult to find and our GPS had us circling downtown Providence but once we arrive we had agreat time. The service was great, food was very good and the atmosphere very energetic. We had sushi, specialty rolls, noodles, pad thai and a few drinks. Only the mai tai failed to impress. We will certainly be back.
January 20, 2014|exciting asain cuisine|5|It was a delightful urbane and most graciously set sushi meal, and the freshness or each course was apparent and lovingly presented. The service was super and the setting on the banks of the Providence river special. great decor to the restaurant.
January 18, 2014|My date and I had such a wonderful|5|My date and I had such a wonderful time. What I remember most fondly is the hospitality. Everyone at the restaurant was warm and friendly. The food was a delight. The ambience was terrific. I have nothing but positives to say about the night. Thank you.
January 15, 2014|Love this place|5|I had read reviews for the restaurant and wanted to try it and Providence Restaurant Week was the perfect reason. The food was fresh, delicious and fast. I will definitely return and I am anxious for longer days and warmer temps to enjoy the atmosphere outside too.
January 11, 2014|We always enjoy the ambiance|5|We always enjoy the ambiance and the food at Jacky's‚Ä¶..this time we found a special bottle of wine on the menu from the Campania region of Italy which was great and reminded us of our recent trip. The view of the city adds an additional dimension of enjoyment and our waitress and the hostess (?owner) were very attentive.
January 11, 2014|Awesome ambience, just good food|4|Jacky's Waterplace has a very high end ambience with great water views. The service was excellent. However, the food is similar to every other Chinese restaurant that offers sushi options. The peking duck was delicious but everything else wasn't too special.
January 10, 2014|outstanding|5|The food is amazing, the view is exquisite and the waitress Nicole is the best. She went above and beyond and heard my boyfriend talking about my birthday being that day and she went the extra step and brought me out a piece of cheesecake with a candle in it. She was there to take pictures of the 2 of us also and she made my birthday that much more special.
December 31, 2013|NYE 2013|5|I made my opentable reservation on xmas eve. All indications was that the reservation posted without a problem. We arrived about 20 minutes early and checked-in with the hostess. They had our reservation. She was very pleasant and said that we were still on-time for our reservation as made. So we went to the bar, which on NYE had a nice crowd but the bartender was very attentive to our arrival and quickly took our drink order. Within a few minutes the hostess came up to us at the bar and told us our table was ready. Earlier than expected. Nice ! Our server came over, introduced herself, took our order and the food came out quickly, as ordered and was OUTSTANDING ! You were the start of a very nice NYE night out in Providence ! Well Done !
December 31, 2013|Extensive Menu and Great Location|3|Visited here on New Year's Eve. The menu has quite a lot of choices although the prices are pretty high across the board. Overall the food was very good, but some items were just average. For example, the calamari appetizer was outstanding but the nime chow appetizer was just okay. The d√©cor and location are the highlight of spot.
December 25, 2013|Christmas Horror|1|The restaurant, which is normally good, was NOT prepared to do business on Christmas! Got there at 7PM...took half hour to be seated, (had reservations for 7) then 20 minutes to get someone's attention for water...the rest was downhill from there ...almost three hours later, left...didn't bother with dessert. There were numerous errors on the check......overcharged,........,big time! We complained, they adjusted check and gave 15% discount...so what?? We'll never get the time back that was wasted, and how sad to have this as a remembrance for Christmas 2013 with family! We will not be going back any time soon...Hire more help!
Dined on December 24, 2013|Fun spot to take the family|5|Great place for a special family outing. Terrific view, service and sushi. Highly recommend.
December 24, 2013|You can always count on Jacky's|5|For great sushi or Chinese food. There is something for everyone. Love the wonton soup and the prices are reasonable
December 23, 2013|Great Experience|4|Jacky's always delivers a great experience. The menu is extensive and you'll definitely find something for everyone in your party!
December 20, 2013|all around AMAZING!!!|5|I just love everything about this place. Food and customer service was amazing
December 20, 2013|I have only heard good things!!!!|4|Food was OUTSTANDING. My GF & I ordered the Shrimp Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Miso soup (I mean who doesn't love Miso Soup??) and then we both ordered the Spicy Maki Roll Combination plate. Everything was AMAZING, I just didn't anticipate how much you got. I still had some sushi to take home! The only 2 things I was bummed about was how our waiter rushed our courses & our drinks. We still had at least half of each course as the next one came out, not a big deal but still...For my drink I ordered the Pomegranate Martini, it tasted like syrup...it was just not good. My GF ordered the Lychee Martini (shes had it before) it didn't come with the Lychee Garnish and was kind of bland (this time she said). I would go back tho, prob just an off day.
December 18, 2013|Great Asian Food|5|I have been to Jacky's a number of times over the past couple of years and find the food and service to be consistently fantastic.
December 14, 2013|Dinner at Jacky's|2|I was rather unpleased with my experience at Jacky's. I was hoping for a relaxing dinner with my boyfriend and it did not quite turn out to that. While the scenery and restaurant design was beautiful, our service and food was not to the same standard. I asked my waitress for a shrimp tempura roll with a soy bean wrap instead of the seaweed wrap when I ordered. When my plate came it did not have the soy bean wrap, but instead, the sea weed. When I asked her to please take it back, she was hesitant and then blamed it on the chefs because they don't speak English. I thought that was poorly handled. By the time my plate finally came back out, my boyfriend was already done with his meal and his plate was cleared and I had just started eating
December 8, 2013|great food and drinks, love|4|great food and drinks, love the ruby red fusion martini!
December 7, 2013|Outstanding!|5|My husband and I frequent all of Jacky's restaurants in RI, but the Waterplace location is by far the most spectacular. Looking forward to the new North Providence location opening!
December 7, 2013|Always Amazing|5|My 4'th visit to Jacky's Waterplace and everything was amazing, as usual! Food, Presentation of the food, Service and the restaurant itself!! Can't wait to go back!
December 4, 2013|Romantic dinner|5|Set right on the waterfront of providence, Jacky's truly whisks you away from the hub bun outside and transports you to an elegant evening full of delicious upscale sushi options as well as plated meals! For N even more romantic experience, reserve a table here on a waterfire night to view the beautiful scene from your table!
December 3, 2013|Special dinner done terrific|5|The best combination of excellent food, service, ambience. Would not change much in the entire experience, will certainly go back. Great value for money and experience. I am sure the views during the waterfire shows amazing.
November 30, 2013|Good food & Service but expensive|4|This restaurant is beautiful, seating is comfortable and everyone was really friendly. Drink prices were about on par with Providence. However, sushi prices were very high. My girlfriend and I have had sushi all over Rhode Island and this is by fair the 2nd most expensive sushi I have had, the first being Nami. On top of which if you want brown rice its an additional $4 for a fancy roll or $2 for the other rolls. I am more than happy to pay for top quality but even top quality sushi isn't worth the prices. . Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I knew going in that they were pricey so there was no shock when the bill came. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend to try but we probably wont be back.
November 27, 2013|Great restaurant|5|The ambiance, service and quality of the food was outstanding. The menu has something for everyone and the staff is very accommodating. Highly recommended.
November 23, 2013|The whole package|5|Jackie's has it all...great food, excellent service, gorgeous interior design and a beautiful view of downtown Prov. It can get a bit loud late on a Saturday night, but most of the time the sound level is merely energetic (acoustically, the place is designed well....it's just that there are a lot of people having fun). You can't go wrong with any of their rolls, sushi or sashimi. Frankly, you can't go wrong at all. Just go.
November 17, 2013|Best Sushi in RI|5|One of the best sushi places in Rhode Island. We loved their fusion rolls - Snow White and Out of Control. This is one of my top 5 favorite places to eat now. The 5 Spice Duck was amazing, as well as my fiances Salmon.
November 15, 2013|Great Time!|4|Went with a group of 8 - dinner was delicious - service lacked no where. Huge portions - sharing suggested!
November 9, 2013|Best sushi in Povidence|5|Great location- especially during Warterfire. Sushi is great. Overall an excellent menu. Big bar with lots of energy. Late night music. Free valet parking.
November 9, 2013|Will definitely try again|3|Will definitely try again the next time that I'm in Providence.
November 9, 2013|Awesome Waterf View and Japanese Di|5|Made early dinner reservation for my wife and I to see Waterfire for 3:45PM on November 9th. Thought it was a bit early but we ended up getting the best table for 2 with a view. Besides getting to see Waterview the Americano roll was amszing. We highly recommend this restaurant while you're nin town. The host, waiter, and management were warm and friendly.
November 9, 2013|Food was outstanding. Felt|4|Food was outstanding. Felt a little rushed through dinner by our waitress. We were seated at a table in front of a door going out to the balcony and it was drafty and chilly. Would definetly go back if we are in the area again.
November 7, 2013|Fancy Asian Fare|5|Outstanding combination of food and ambiance. Vibrant, and first rate!
November 2, 2013|One of the best if not the|5|One of the best if not the best oriental restaurants in Providence. Great food .
November 2, 2013|Wonderful Experience|4|I had reserved for a group of 10, changed it to 12, then beyond my control reduced it to 9. We were also early. The staff was very accommodating for us, seated us anyway in a very pleasant long booth for a family birthday celebration. The food service was excellent and all our food (and there was a lot of it) was very fresh! Great gem for Providence!
November 2, 2013|Fun place|5|Food was delish, a lot of choices on menu and fun atmosphere. We are going back soon.
October 28, 2013|Beautiful place, decent food|4|The decor and ambience get an A+. The food itself... maybe a B. I was excited to try the Peking Duck, since we have so little choices around RI, and I would give that a B+. The meal itself was very tasty, but for a whole duck, I was hoping the fish was bigger. We also ordered soft shell crab, which had a great light tempura batter but a tasteless sauce. Finally, we ordered a steamed sea bass, which tasted plain. My mother and I gave in to the dessert menu, and we ordered a creme brulee that was good enough but not spectacular. All in all, I would probably give the place one more try before making a final decision about Jacky's Waterplace.
October 23, 2013|Jackie's is worth the wait|5|I don't get there often but it is always worth the trip, once a year with a business associate we meet for dinner, same time next year evening and it is never a failure. The meal is always delicious, the service pleasant and accommodating and how can you beat the view. Try the Volcano Roll.
October 21, 2013|Dinner in Providence|4|We had only one night to spend in Providence and chose Jacky's based on Opentable reviews and friend recommendations ....was not disappointed. Food was great, but even better was the service. We were visiting from out of town and our server...Can't remember his name, but he was fantastic (from Nevada) was very helpful with the menu and shared great conversation. Would def. return!
October 16, 2013|Never disappointed|5|My family has dined here a few times, and we have never been anything other than thrilled with the experience. The servers and valets are friendly, the decor and setting are beautiful, it's easy to get to, and the food is excellent. Consistently. I've been working in food service for 17 years, in fast food, turn and burn full service and very high end restaurants...privately owned and corporate. I'm now a manager running my own store. Trust the opinion of somebody who knows...this place is fantastic.
October 12, 2013|Our server was horrible. She|4|Our server was horrible. She forgot about us for over 25 minutes. It also took her almost 15 minutes to greet us in the beginning. She made us feel insignifigant and not worth her time. It is a shame because overall the restaurant was great. We missed our plans that we had shecduled for after.
October 12, 2013|We had a wonderful birthday|5|We had a wonderful birthday celebration for the 55 year old Dad, and 15 year old son. Everyone enjoyed the festive ambience, the wonderful service,and the good food. We could enjoy waterfire from the deck.
October 12, 2013|Water Fire view NOT|2|I do not like that they had told me that you could see the fires while dining! As you could NOT! The bartenders were slow and not friendly ~ The drinks were very weak! However our waitress was very kind and did an excellent job! The Food was good but small portions ~ One of the guys was still hungry! They were busy so I guess they must be doing something right! Oh well many more restaurants to review :)
October 11, 2013|Expensive but good.|5|Took my family here on Friday night of parents weekend at RISD. My oldest is a freshmen and she was craving sushi. Jacky's fit the need very well. It is upscale Asian but had everything for all tastes. It was pricey but I will come again next time we come to town!
October 5, 2013|Good food|5|Food was awesome, service was attentive and polite.
October 5, 2013|Loved it!|5|The wait staff was wonderful, very accomodating. The valet service was excellent. The food was incredible! The shrimp appetizer and steamed scallop entree was some of the best food we ever had!
September 28, 2013|Great spot for Waterfire!|5|Came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. While there was a 45 minute wait for walk-ins, we were seated right away. The menu has lots of options. We ordered sushi for an appetizer and two hot entrees. Our waitress informed us that the sushi bar was backed up and asked if we wanted to switch our order - so we did. Minutes later she came back to say the sushi chef insisted that we didn't cancel, moved our order to the front of the list - and it arrived a few minutes later. Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Overall, the food was very good. We had steak & shrimp surf & turf and the chicken and string beans in garlic sauce. We received a complimentary cheesecake for my boyfriends birthday with a candle which was great!
September 28, 2013|Showy w/ok food|3|"Impressive space, great location and wonderful to have valet parking. Don't go expecting the value of ""traditional"" asian restaurants. Can't be beat on a Waterfire night."
September 21, 2013|Too Loud and Too Slow|3|"Service was terrible, no fault of our lovely waitress! The kitchen & sushi bar were extremely slow! While the sushi is good, my din ordered chicken with green beans, you coukd have used the chicken as a frisbee it was so tough! The Manager when told about how slow it was simply replied...""it's because it Water Fire Night""! So does that mean you shouldn't bother going there during Water Fire!? I think it's over priced and over glorified! Nice View though!"
September 21, 2013|wonderful waterfire dining evening|5|great food, great service, great location. make a reservation
September 20, 2013|Excellence|5|I've been to Jacky's many times and never have we had a bad experience. The food is consistently excellent and the service perfect.
Dined on September 14, 2013|"A ""fusion"" of taste & service"|5|"We dined here after a PPAC matinee show. Jacky's is a short and interesting walk from the PPAC and it is an extremely welcoming place. We were greeted enthusiastically by everyone including the valet staff, hostess staff, the hard working guys at the sushi bar, our server (Julie) and the manager. Julie was ""spot on"" with the service that she provided. She was very attentive to us regarding the menu and was quite engaging on numerous aspects of the restaurant, its cuisine and Providence in general. We dined on the Cucumber Nime Chow, toro sashimi , Shanghai Noodles and the Sea Scallops with Spicy Chinese Black Bean Sauce and Japanese Teriyaki Sauce. All of the dishes were wonderfully presented and tasted great!. We will be back!"
September 10, 2013|Great food and awesome service!|5|Great food and awesome service! I loved it overall. Not pricey also. I will definitely be going back!
September 7, 2013|A Water Fire Must|5|Great food, fun vibe, views of the lighting of Water Fire and a value compare to other restaurants around the lighting
September 6, 2013|Ambiance + Views|4|Jacky's in Waterplace Park is a great dining experience for the ambiance and views of downcity Providence. The crab rangoon was top notch. Our spring rolls were also good with a nice, crisp wrap and flavorful contents. The shrimp and vegetable tempura was average with no real memorable flavors. The salmon teriyaki was very good and served with asparagus done to perfection. The strir fry chicken in oyster sauce was again rated enjoyable but not a standout. We ended by sharing a complimentary birthday cheesecake that was a pleasant surprise. Jacky's excels with ambiance & service that rivels the best in Providence. Ultimately our experience was one you will enthusiaticaly recommend to all but your pickiest of restaurant-loving friends.
August 30, 2013|Excellent experience|5|I chose this restaurant for dinner with my family that was in town from Arizona. I wanted to give them an energetic night out while also showing off the city I live in. Jacky's gave us all of this and more, it truly was a wonderful experience. The service was excellent and they even gave us a table by the window with a great view of the city. I highly recommend this place, the food was excellent!
August 15, 2013|Divine!|5|The food was outstanding and so artfully presented! We entertained a business associate from out of state and he loved it. Ask for Julie if you go here. She was exceptional, delivering everything in a timely manner and was very personable.
August 14, 2013|Wonderful experience!!|5|From the friendly valet, to sweet hostess to our fantastic waitress Cheryl--we had the best experience!! It's so pretty and the view was amazing! Starting with Asian Pear Martinis to whole steamed Chilean Sea Bass and Firecracker and volcano sushi!!! The best!! Dessert was a sphere of three sorbets dipped into white chocolate and drizzled with dark, and cut into a flower for our plate!! We had enough appetizers to take home for midnight snack :) Can't wait to return!!
August 10, 2013|Great but BRIGHT|5|Fantastic venue. Sushi is awesome, great drinks, great atmosphere with the exception of the lighting. The place has an incredible view which you can enjoy because it's WAY too bright inside to see outside. It's unfortunate
August 10, 2013|Good Chinese food, prompt service|3|We went on a busy WaterFire night, and were seated within 10 minutes of our 9 pm reservation time. The lettuce wraps were good, the Peking duck came quickly (for that dish) and was good, but not outstanding. The fried rice was pretty good, as were the Shanghai noodles. To its credit, Jacky's does not overdo soy sauce like so many Asian fusion restaurants. I would skip the sushi, the one dish I ordered as an appetizer seemed to have used defrosted sushi (watery texture). No beer on tap, which was a little disappointing, but they have an acceptable collection of American and Asian beers. The service was very fast, without rushing us, even on a busy night, but don't expect much help with the menu.
August 10, 2013|First time- loved it!|5|My husband and I went to Jacky's on a Waterfire night, and brought our 8 year old daughter along. The valet was smooth and super convenient. We were seated almost immediately upon arriving for our reservation. The waitstaff was fantastic, very professional. The atmosphere is bright, fun and festive, and my daughter loved it. We had a great table by the window overlooking the outdoor bar space. The food was my favorite part; everything was cooked perfectly, and we all loved the dishes we ordered. The drinks were fantastic, and priced at about what we would expect for downtown upscale bar pricing ($8- $10 each). The food arrived timely, and we left the restaurant in no hurry, just in time for the Waterfire lighting. Overall, it was perfect
August 10, 2013|Upscale, Trendy|4|The restaurant, with prime location in downtown Providence and central to WaterFire, was beautiful and trendy. Our party of 4 had 5:45pm reservations and we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. For Appetizer recommendation, the fried Calamari with spicy asian slaw was delicious. For dinners we had the 14 pc Sushi (very good), Shrimp Pad Tai (very good) and the Grilled Whole Squid Stuffed with Avocado Maki (outstanding!). A little pricy for Asian food, but you're paying for the ambience and efficient service as well. I would recomend and return.
August 10, 2013|Exceptional|5|Our server Kenny is friendly/ kind he makes you feel so welcome, that it makes you want to go back he's exceptional.
August 9, 2013|Great food, great view|4|Perfect location for dinner before or during Waterfire. Sat at the bar where service was great. Sushi and lychee martinin were excellent.
August 2, 2013|pricey for asian/chinese food|3|Can't beat the location and view on a beautiful summer's evening. Go for the ambiance and presentation but be aware the food is pricey for what you get. Tasty but definitely unlike other Asian-style restaurants where you expect good value for your dollar. Good for special occasions and to impress someone. Staff was attentive and pleasant.
July 28, 2013|Best Asian Fusion in Providence!|5|Complimentary valet service is definitely a big plus! Staff was welcoming and friendly to four adults and two children in tow. Service was excellent, as was the menu. Children were fascinated by the four-sided tropical fish tank just inside the entrance, as were the adults. Everything we ordered was beautifully presented and delicious - nothing disappointed! The bill was a welcome surprise, and the valet let us leave our vehicles so that we could spend an hour exploring the surrounding area. It was a perfect meal, prepared and served by a competent staff, in a lovely setting. Don't miss the experience.
July 25, 2013|Providence showcase|4|Jacky's Waterplace is a showcase in and of itself as well as a showcase highlighting the beautiful Providence skyline.
July 19, 2013|Outstanding from every aspect!|5|Jacky's is an amazing spot in Providence. The food is exceptional and the staff in beyond friendly. Sushi there is to die for and the calamari is heaven on a plate. The timing of food is fluid and the layout of the restaurant is pleasing. The entire dining room overlooks the river. I highly recommend this neo japanese/chinese restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal and a great night out!
July 13, 2013|Waterfire 7/13|4|Reservation for 8:15pm, arrived at 7:45 and was told I would receive a text when our window table with a view of waterfire would be ready. My girlfriend and I decided to hang at the bar. On a side note, the bartender (not sure of his name) was great, personable, and realistic about the wait time for sushi, and acknowledged us immediately. So after about 45 mins (now 8:30pm - 15 mins after my reservation time and still no text message) I checked with the maitre d, and was informed he had not forgotten us but our table still was not ready, so we headed to the deck. At about 905pm, still no text message, we checked again, then finally were seated at a table which definitely was not in view of waterfire. Everything after being seated was great!
July 12, 2013|I chose this restaurant just|2|I chose this restaurant just because I really wanted to eat Asian food here in Providence. The location is good, but the food was not so good. The atmosphere was good and it is also nice that it is near the river and the view is nice. The food might be good for those who do not eat Aisan food occcasionally, but for Asain guys, the food is normal or below the average. To be honest, when I tasted the food, I thought that I can cook mode delicious food than this restaurant food. I was not impressed by the taste of food (the taste was so strong and not delicate as normal Asian food has). I dtrongly hope that some Asianrestaurants which has not only great atmosphere but also serves delicious authentic Asian food wil be open here in Providence.
July 12, 2013|Exceptional Service|3|The waiter we had on 7/12/13 was excellent which made it a great time for our first time here but the food was disappointing. I order off the restaurant week menu where I got chicken asparagus with oyster sauce and the asparagus was so old and thick not very visually appealing and stringy.
July 8, 2013|Good experience|4|Loved the atmosphere. Quiet on a Monday night, but definitely will go back.
July 5, 2013|Excellent food + great service|4|Excellent food + great service + friendly atmosphere + great view of the river + valet service if needed = great dining experience
July 4, 2013|Lovely setting|4|The restaurant is perfect for after a movie or after work. Delicious food.
June 29, 2013|Ambiance, Haute Cuisine and Service|5|I love the interior but didn't think the food would measure up to the gorgeous decor. I am happy to have been proven wrong. Our server was very accommodating and professional- enthusiastic even, about helping us choose vegetarian entrees. It met my requirements for ambiance, haute cuisine and excellent service. We are happy to ad Jacky's Waterplace to our select restaurant repertoire here in Providence.
June 22, 2013|great find|4|We were not sure if going to a chinese restraunt in Providence would be a good idea, but the food was fresh and so good! Our waiter had too many tables and we were not getting great service in the beginning. The owner was at the restaurant and always walking around checking the tables and asking people about the food which was great to see. She realized that we were waiting too long in between courses and our table was not being cleared and drinks not getting refilled. She got someone to come clean in between courses and even got someone else to bring our food. She even spoke to our waiter. We will go back and hopefully we will not have a problem with service again.
June 21, 2013|Great time|5|Amazing sushi and our server was awesome! Very friendly and personable. Great atmosphere. Will be back.
June 20, 2013|great food, great service|5|great food, great service with Peter, and great view. what more could you ask for.
June 15, 2013|Always a great time...|4|"There are a few Jacky's in RI, but obviously this is the flagship in terms of atmosphere. They're all good, but this one takes it up a notch and adds some more ""higher-end"" Asian options to the menu. Great service, great drinks, always very accommodating. Would recommend to anyone, although know that it is at a slightly more premium price point."
June 13, 2013|Unique in the area|5|Jackys is the only upscale Asian style restaurant in a sea of Italian style cucina's. The combination of Chinese and Japanese cuisine is excellent and the preparation is as close to authentic as I've seen. Jacky's is definitely a memorable experience, fabulous food and enough selections to make you go back again and again!
June 8, 2013|Not a fan|2|Menu item descriptions created high expectations, but the food fell flat. After splitting the calamari and a sushi roll, we just didn't want to continue to try things. Service was spotty as multiple wait staff was waiting on us and every question we asked wasn't understood well so we just stopped asking questions. Would not return or recommend.
June 8, 2013|Nice place on WaterFire event night|5|Nice place on WaterFire event night. Also this place will participate in Providence Restaurant week on July. Don't miss it. Food was fresh and reasonable price. I love sushi, roll and noodle. And my table server(Chinese guy) was really kind.
May 31, 2013|AMAZING EXPERIENCE!|5|Food was outstanding and our waitress made the night a special one! Would highly recommend!
May 31, 2013|Disappointing|2|Had a reservation at 8:15, didn't get seating until 8:45. Service was so slow despite not being that busy for 9PM! Probably would never go back.
May 31, 2013|Always good, nice to be outside|5|We usually go to Jacky's in Cumberland but after finding their downtown restaurant, with a great outdoor seating area in Providence, we go there when the weather is nice. Even indoors it is a great experience. Great food, great drinks, very nice servers and valet parking. The outdoor area looks down on the river walk where you can see gondola taking people for rides. Very crowded on Waterfire night but worth it. Great place.

May 25, 2013|Great Food and Scenery|5|We were seated at a window table during WaterFire. The overall decor and atmosphere is very modern and colorful. All of our dishes were absolutely delicious and full of flavor. I will definitely come back the next time I visit Providence.
May 25, 2013|Nice place, but...|3|Nice ambience, but food was very mediocre. 2 Appetizers were very good, but main dish was in a sticky sweet sauce and no heat as it was described. The Rainbow salad was tasteless, hardly had any salad, no peanuts as described, and very little sashimi; hardly worth $15.
May 25, 2013|Vanessa's Review|5|I enjoyed the food, drinks and atmosphere quite a lot. I have no complaints about my meal whatsoever. It is gorgeous inside the restaurant and I had great service.

Very good experience all the way around.

May 15, 2013|First visit|5|First time visited Jacky's for a birthday celebration. Upon arrival were very impressed with the overall atmosphere and character. Had a great meal of a peking duck starter followed by a variety of sushi and a side of noodles. Not to overlook the scorpian bowl and lychee mohito. Everything was very tasty. On a side note, I am sure this would be a great meal spot during water fire. We will be back.

May 10, 2013|Good Night|4|We sat outside and it was a perfect evening for outdoor dining. Our server, Kyle was a great waiter. He didn't rush us and he was more than happy to answer any of our questions. He brought our good and drinks out in a timely manner. More importantly, he was able to get along and joke with our group very well.

April 20, 2013|Thumbs up!|3|My guests from France and Los Angeles and I enjoyed the meal, but as middle-aged folk, we felt it was a bit more noisy than we preferred. We might have enjoyed it more on a night other than Sat. Good food. Great service. We will try Jacky's again on a less busy night and when we can sit outside.
April 13, 2013|had a great view as requested.|5|had a great view as requested. From the time we stepped into the reataurant until leaving everyone was pleasant. the presentation of food was outstanding. will be back
April 6, 2013|great restaurant, beautiful|5|great restaurant, beautiful and modern with great views of the water and downtown area. We arrived too early for our reservation and they tried hard to accomodate us but it was not necessary. They were very nice to our kids. The bar had a nice cocktail list. The plate presentations were very nice. The desserts though didn't impress us much, we had the chocolate mousse and banana tempura.
April 6, 2013|Elegance with a View.|4|We've been to Jackie's several times and the food is always very good. It is beautifully designed and situated and the atmosphere if very urbane. There are always large groups of people there for celebrations of some kind, but they are never raucous, which is most likely because one gets cues from the meticulously coordinated design that this place is intended to be elegant. The views of downtown Providence are the best of any restaurant in the city. The bar is very handsome and is always full of people. On this occasion our waiter, though very personable, was not very polished and didn't time our meals all that well. I have a bit of a pet peeve for unfilled water glasses, and I can't stand it when someone hands me my plate.
March 29, 2013|Chris|5|Food presentation was outstanding. Work of art. Food was delicious. Had 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. All were prefect. Never knew saki could be so good and all the small things are covered. Free valet, friendly coat-check, wonderful service and even hand-written descriptions on my leftover chinese-boxes. A bit pricey for chinese but NOT for eating out in an upscale restaurant that pampers you and supplies top-notch food.

March 23, 2013|This is a great spot to eat.|4|This is a great spot to eat. Fabulous view of the water, excellent food and presentation and beautiful atmosphere. Only thing is the service was slow. We had a 6 pm reservation and were not served til almost 50 min. later. Perhaps the flying fish and super bowl sushi prep required extra time. There was no other criticism I would make, other than the fact I have found the restaurant noisy at times(but it wasn't as noisy tonite....perhaps because it was early and the bar scene hadn't arrived in force yet). Definitely will be back anyway.
March 23, 2013|First Timers @ Providence Jacky's|5|We go to Jacky's in Cumberland almost every Sunday. This was our first time at the Providence location and it was absolutely fantastic! The food and staff were great! The view of Waterplace was great as well. We can't wait to go back.

Fun atmosphere, great cocktail menu and really great food! Clean and very well organized! Wait staff was great and our bill was $175.00 for the five of us. We will be returning and the view of the city of providence was outstanding! A must for Summer dining as they have and amazing view of the river! Highly recommended! Enjoy!

March 2, 2013|Had reservations for 8 pm,|3|Had reservations for 8 pm, and weren't seated until 8:45. We had to commandeer a table ourselves, ask for menus and flag down a waiter. The maitre de seemed overwhelmed as did the waiter. Despite this, I'll give it another try since the food and atmosphere were neat.

February 23, 2013|This was our first dining|5|This was our first dining experience at Jacky's we absolutely loved it, we started our night out in the lounge, bar staff was fun and energetic we ended up pushing our reservation out by an hour as we were just enoying ourselves. When we requested to be seated we were immediately shown to our table, hostess so nice and the waiter was great food was fantastic nor did we ever feel rushed throughout our dinner. Our night was truly enjoyable and we will be back with friends/family. Thank you for a great evening!
February 22, 2013|Dinner with a view|4|We went to Jacky's after the 2013 RI Spring Flower & Garden Show and had a really nice time. We were a party of seven and had requested a table by the window. The view of Providence was a nice backdrop to the ambiance of the restaurant. The table was ready in a timely fashion. The waiter was friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. We started with a range of appetizers consisting of shrimp nime chow, coconut shrimp, hot and sour soup, and the vegetable tempura. Then, we ordered an assortment of maki rolls, pad thai, and singapore noodles. All the dishes were delicious. The maki was fresh and the presentation was beautiful. My boyfriend and I split a scorpion bowl which was also very well-made. We will definitely be going back.

The attention to detail that went into the design and decoration of this space was breath-taking. The sushi was very good and the lobster was perfect. We will definitely make another trip back to providence for this restaurant.
