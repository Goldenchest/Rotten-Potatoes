My Delmonico steak was good but can get comparable elsewhere much cheaper. The filet mignon was not even close to par for the price. Probably wouldn't go back for dinner but maybe sushi and late night drinks. The waiter very good, well spoken, explained the items on the menu perfectly, and was always there when we needed him.
February 21, 2016|Ten for Ten|5|"Ten has never disappointed me. The food and service is consistently excellent. My husband and I dined at Ten this weekend for a belated Valentine's Day dinner. He was a little hesitant as he doesn't like to try new places, but having been here a handful of times before with friends and family, I knew he would enjoy it. Our waiter, Eric, was very helpful and attentive. We had the Prime Roll, which was my absolute favorite sushi roll on their menu and we both ordered the Delmonico steak and loved the ""top it off"" options. The steak was cooked to our liking and the sauces recommended by Eric complimented our steaks perfectly. We rarely order desserts, but I just LOVE their banana bread pudding. It's a cozy place with great atmosphere and great food. Will come back again!"
February 20, 2016|Not worth the $$$$ !!!!|2|Completely underwhelming for the $$$$. Seaweed salad was awful. Medium steak showed no pink. Hot rocks a waste of money. 3 requests with long wait between each request for one drink. Wait staff seemed confused. Party of many skewers and the potatoes were good. Waitress became friendly when giving the check. That was nice.

All steaks were cooked to perfection. Our server was excellent and very conscious of the time i.e. We had theater tickets. An excellent meal overall.
February 16, 2016|Good place to relax and enjoy the food.|5|We were in a rush to get to a show and our waiter couldn't have been more helpful. The food was very good and the service excellent. Looking forward to returning.
February 14, 2016|Great service|3|The service was exceptional, however the steaks my wife and I received were overcooked. I ordered medium rare, which came out to medium well with not even any pink in the center. My wife ordered a medium well, which was close, but even closer to well done. Flavor would have been on point, it's just that the steaks were much tougher than we would have liked due to them being overcooked. Just not acceptable for the prices they are charging.
February 14, 2016|Rare cold temps - should have gone elsewhere|2|The outside temps were negative but inside was painfully cold. I heard Prime was closed prior and then opened thinking it was warm enough - it was not. The service was below average - slow everything. Cesar salad (not a difficult one to master) was a 5/10. The main course of sesame tuna seared rare was excellent. For the price, service, and non-friendly location, I'd pass on this place going forward.
February 14, 2016|Even with minimal heat, a worthwhile visit|4|"Having almost not opened on Vday due to a water main break in the basement, they apologized for the chilly temperature within the restaurant. Paying that much $ while most wore their coats due to the chilly atmosphere... we still enjoyed ourselves much due to ""Johnnie"" our waiter. Having been in the restaurant business for 25+ years, Johnnie's a keeper who offered the service that allows one to keep some faith in the industry. He was so good, that I never even mentioned my overcooked filet... yes from a steak house (kind of). And yes, it would have been sent back if not for Johnnie. Coconut Sushi app was the highlight, as well as the banana bread pudding to wrap things up. I can only imagine how much more my date and I would have enjoyed it if the temperature was above 60 degrees. Maybe a free app or dessert would have been a nice offering due to the arctic chill? No worries though, we'll be back."
February 13, 2016|Good food|4|The food was prepared very well and as expected. I still feel the steak is just a tad bit better at the Capital Grille. I still very much enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as a comparable location or an alternative. Drinks were priced as average.
February 6, 2016|Great food|4|We had a a great meal and the service was perfect! Everyone was happy with their meal. Veal Chop, Delmonico Steak, Steamed lobster, steak. Apps were great as well. Oysters, shrimp cocktail, and Cesar Salad. Birthday cake was wonderful and beautifully presented. Thank you.
February 5, 2016|Amazing!|5|I have been going to Ten for the past few years. I have yet to find a restaurant that out beats the sushi, atmosphere and service!
February 4, 2016|Can say this was the best sushi I've had...|5|Can say this was the best sushi I've had. Johnny our waiter was phenomenal! He made a huge effort to make us feel cared for and not just customers at a restaurant. Overall a great experience and look forward to our return for more amazing food and service. Thank you!
January 30, 2016|Overpriced|3|I have been here many times but was disappointed in the slow service and the overpriced and mediocre food. Steak was overlooked and bland. Tuna was ok but lacked seasoning. Sushi was good but veal chop way over priced.
January 28, 2016|Outstanding as always! Have NEVER has an...|5|Outstanding as always! Have NEVER has anything there that the entire table didn't love. Service us always great. Ask for one of Johnnys tables if possible he's the best! We dine at Ten about once a month. This time we brought our daughter on her 18th birthday because she wanted sushi. Johnny went above and beyond to make her feel special and their sushi is always the best!!
January 27, 2016|Always have had a good experience at 10 ...|4|Always have had a good experience at 10 but with all of the choices for restaurants in providence it does little to separate itself. Need more rolls on the sushi menu - service was excellent but forgot my salad- everyone screws up and he resolved it quickly. I would not cross it off my list but would try other spots before coming back. Mac and cheese best I have had.
January 22, 2016|Great service|4|Went for my birthday dinner. Love the atmosphere. Out server was super. Swordfish and Salmon were dry. Usually the food is delicious though!
January 22, 2016|Great for sushi lovers and for steak people too!|5|Our overall experience was amazing! We have a super friendly waiter named Johnny who had great character and really helped with our decision making! He was very funny and suggested delicious food - which I'm glad with the choices we went with (hot rocks app, tataki maki, & sushi sandwich.) The hot rocks appetizer was fun and entertaining especially since we got to cook our own little steak pieces! I higher recommend going here, whether it be for a special occasion or date night!
January 21, 2016|I go here often. I absolutely recommend ...|5|I go here often. I absolutely recommend getting the sushi sandwich (add truffle oil to it for a lil extra flavor). I often times get a great server, but have had a bad server a few times. The food itself is pretty good. I love that I can go here for a casual dinner, or a professional small meeting dinner.
January 17, 2016|Great place with great service!|5|I took my wife the other night for her birthday. Carla was our server. She was very friendly and attentive. The food came in a reasonable time. The presentation was excellent and quite good. We had a mixture of sushi and regular dining. It can be a bit pricey but we will definitely go back!!! I recommend it to anyone.
January 8, 2016|My new favorite restaurant!|5|Food is outstanding and service, exceptional! I've eaten there three times in the last month and each time have left more impressed. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
December 31, 2015|Fun lunch spot|5|The service was friendly and professional and the sushi was spectacular. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. Great specialty drinks too!
December 26, 2015|We are frequent patrons of Ten Prime and...|5|We are frequent patrons of Ten Prime and this visit reinforces why we return time after time. The waitstaff, and that includes Harrison, make us always feel welcomed and anticipate our needs. The food is fantastic, every dish we have ever ordered are always spot on and leave us wanting more. I am actually reluctant to write a good review because I do not want to share this place with anyone else.
December 19, 2015|Girls Night Out - Christmas Dinner|5|My best friends and I had our Christmas dinner at Ten Prime this past weekend. It was a first time visit for both of my friends and they can't stop raving about it! We had an amazing time our waiter was super friendly and as always the food was amazing! We can't wait to go back again :)
December 19, 2015|Great Place|5|Fantastic Food. We did not partake of the sushi, but the fish and meat were exquisite. Great Wine list and one of the best waiters I've ever had. I would highly recommend.
December 18, 2015|Fun place, decor was cool and eclectic. ...|4|Fun place, decor was cool and eclectic. Service a bit rushed which was unusual and on a slower night so no need for that. Swordfish was just a bit dry, but the sauce and sweet potato crab hash was excellent. Steak and scallops were perfect. It is pricey so I did expect perfectly cooked fish.

November 28, 2015|Birthday Dinner|5|My boyfriend took me for a romantic birthday dinner to 10 Prime (my favorite restaurant). I love that I can get a filet (the best filet I've ever had) and a roll of sushi. The variety of the menu and the quality of food is outstanding. We topped it off with the Banana bread pudding dessert........if you haven't tried it, you need to! :) I will be making a reservation for my girls' night Christmas dinner!
November 27, 2015|Best sushi (crunchie munchie) I've ever ...|5|Best sushi (crunchie munchie) I've ever had! Steak was off the walls awesome!

November 21, 2015|Amazing from the moment we walked in|5|The food was outstanding! The wait staff very attentive, friendly and attentive. Food prep, delivery and taste was outstanding!! Can't wait of back
November 19, 2015|Steak not prime but sushi fabulous|4|Service was friendly and on point. Decor, noise level and lighting create the perfect atmosphere. Food was disappointing. Delmonico was very, very chewy, with large fat pieces. Tataki maki, on the other hand, was heavenly, rich and full of flavor. Our first visit and likely our last, as we much prefer XO Cafe.
November 14, 2015|Every dish we had, ahi, del monico, swor...|4|Every dish we had, ahi, del monico, sword fish & filet was off the chart! Fresh, cooked to perfection & as reqested. The salmon sashimi was like butter. The king crab succulent. The desserts just followed suit. The creme Brule was rich, creamy with wonderful carmelizing. The lava cake came at number 1 compared to the other 3 restaurants we tried while in RI. Our service was top notch too. Totally present but unobtrusive. Kudos TPS&S!
November 13, 2015|My favorite place|5|Love this place so much. Right now I can't think of a better restaurant with better food or drinks!
November 7, 2015|Eaten here several times over many years...|3|Eaten here several times over many years. Seems to be on again off again. Menu is good but for a place that has steak in it's name, the filet should never be overcooked, and it was. Mashed potatoes are a featured side and they tasted instant. Still a good go to spot, but really need to step up the quality of food and preparation to maintain reputation,...currently slightly above average at best. Wine list needs updating as well.
November 7, 2015|We used to love the food here- have not ...|3|We used to love the food here- have not been in over a year. But for our anniversary- we wanted to go back hit we used to have such wonderful food and pretty reasonable. But for the money we paid- like double- we were very disappointed. The appetizer was practically burnt, there was hardly any dressing on the salad, and everything was extra. We did love our server though- he was very attentive and nice.
November 5, 2015|Another excellent providence restaurant|5|The service was outstanding. The steak was tops as was the halibut just an overall great place for dinner

November 1, 2015|Fine cuisine|5|We had dinner on the night after Halloween, a Sunday, so the place was quiet; it was our first time, and I must say the service was wonderful and the food exceptionally good -- including the dessert, a light souffle. We were very pleased. I may add that it was my birthday.

Dined on October 24, 2015|10 is the perfect name for it|5|I would give this restaurant a 10 in every aspect. Food, atmosphere, wait staff! Love it all. A little pricey for me but if it wasn't we would go all the time.
October 23, 2015|Not good|1|Waitress spilled my wife's wine and never replaced it. Steak is overpriced with no sides 48.00 dollars for a small burnt steak. Veal chop my wife had was all fat. Stay away from this restaurant overpriced no parking and terrible service. Side dishes not included with meal you have to pay extra!!!

October 10, 2015|Perfect for a romantic anniversary dinner!|5|Excellent sushi and steak. Wonderful service! Not a single negative thing to say about our experience there! Best evening out in a long time!
October 10, 2015|Solid|4|Great reliable dining. These guys know how to run a restaurant and execute. They handled our unruly party of 15 with ease. The food was well executed. Drinks were good. Service was professional and prompt. Definitely on the list.

September 26, 2015|Prime dinner|4|We had a quick early dinner . My husband had the 8 oz filet mignon. It was accompanied by a dressed arugala salad. Our server,who was very nice, never mentioned that when we asked what else would be on the plate. We also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, which, at $8. was a generous serving but not garlicky at all, and a bit dry. The server also never offered to bring a basket of bread on the table. That would have been nice. I noticed it on another table after we had eaten. I had the cruncy munchie sushi roll. It was delicious. Because it was early, it was enough for dinner for me, but otherwise would have made a good appetizer. My husband had one glass of house red wine. Total for this dinner with tip and tax--$100. We would have liked to add dessert but we going to Waterfire and thought we'd get something interesting there. Big mistake--we should have ordered dessert.
September 18, 2015|steeaaaaakkkk!!|4|Went last minute on a Friday. Our waiter was great (Johnny?), the food was great. We split a steak, cooked perfect medium, we each got our own sauce on the side. What I didn't like is that it was a tight squeeze, the tables are really close together. Almost felt like we were eating with the people on either side of us.
September 12, 2015|Great service!|4|Great service!
September 11, 2015|Johnny|5|Our waiter rocked and he was on point with everything. Someone who seemed genuine and liked where he worked. His suggestion for our appetizer was perfect and desert. I'm going back but definitely on his shift. Food out is hard to rave about. This placed was dalishhhhhh!!!
September 5, 2015|Johnny!|5|Johnny, the waiter! The Best EVER!!! Made our night so special, and just want to say THANK YOU! You are a ROCK STAR! Thanks for making the night PERFECT.
August 29, 2015|Doesn't stand up to the hype.|3|Cooked Food was plated on top of a cold prep. 5 of us waited a good 10 minutes while the last in our party waited for her 'special'. Satay app was exremely dry and sushi just ok. Coffee was cold (really? How hard is it to serve a hot cup of coffee?). One false step after another here. We were seated in the back room which resembled a dark box or better yet the difference between first class and coach. High price vs. mediocre quality and ambience ($225/couple with tip). There are much better places in the area to visit. I will not return.
August 29, 2015|Great time|5|"We had an excellent meal! It was a birthday celebration. The server brought out our dessert on a platter with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate around the dessert. Loved it!"
August 26, 2015|Ten rates a ten!|5|I came here from Connecticut with my husband for his birthday after making an open table reservation. From the moment we walked in, they were very attentive and helpful. The lovely hostess was informed it was a birthday & communicated this to Sean, our seasoned & friendly cheerful waiter. His attention to detail was fabulous. We had a great leisurely meal. The food was perfect, the drinks were nice. They even had my favorite flavored pear grey goose vodka with the perfect fresh pear garnish just the way I wanted it! A nice surprise was waiting at the end when Sean came out with the desserts on a happy birthday written in chocolate tray with a candle and my hubby's name spelled correctly as we mentioned! It was a positive experience from soup to nuts! Thanks.
August 24, 2015|Excellent Dining Spot|5|I'm a recent transplant from Boston and have dined in many excellent restaurants in the city. I thought Ten Prime Steak & Sushi was on par with many of those restaurants (as are the prices). The sushi was fresh, steak was perfectly cooked and chocolate souffle sinful. Wait staff was phenomenal. The only drawback was the music was a little loud. Overall a great restaurant for a special occasion.
August 7, 2015|Service was spectacular!!|5|"james was our waiter. He was phenomenal. I took my boyfriend out for his birthday. It was our first time. As he loves steak and I love sushi. Complementary valet was perfect. James recommended his favorite dishes and appetizers. We ordered the stoner and the blue mule. They tasted great and were very strong which we love especially for the price. We ordered the hot rocks which tasted great as we cooked it to our liking. For 22$ it should have a few more pieces of meat but over all it was amazing. I ordered a plate of sushi ""the mermaid"" and my boyfriend ordered the delmonico. A side of loaded smashed potatoes and the mushrooms (which I didn't care for at all, but I mixed them with the potatoes and ate them anyways. The potatoes were amazinggg I couldn't stop eating them and the sushi roll was great. I had only mentioned to James once that it was our first time there and I took my boyfriend for his birthday. We enjoyed another drink because we loved it so much. Before he gave me the check he surprised my boyfriend with a birthday scoop of ice cream. It had strawberrys, a candle and happy birthday written in chocolate sauce and caramel on both sides. It was amazing. I was so shocked and thankful. It made his birthday even more special. The bill came to 138.00 so I left James with a 41$ tip. He was a great waiter. We were very pleased. Definitely a spot we will visit again."
August 1, 2015|Maybe the second time?|3|"I classified my tithe as ""Maybe the second time"" because I see the potential of it becoming a destination type restaurant. Bar wasn't busy and there were three bartenders but found them all very moody. Almost as though it was a hassle for them to habe us there. Service at the bar was slow. Dinner service was average. Food was very good with the exception of the chowder. Actually it was very tasty just on the cold side. All in all our experience was OK. Next time we are in the area will it be the restaurant of choice? Possibly."
August 1, 2015|Best service ever!|5|"The food was great. The waiter sensed and accommodated our pace. Our meal was customized to our needs with no effort. John, our waiter, may just be the best waiter I've ever had. He was there every single time we needed something. He anticipated and managed our drink and food deliveries effortlessly. We were difficult and demanding and chaotic, but he handled it with aplomb. I say this as someone who used to own an upscale restaurant and knows a little bit about what constitutes truly great service. If you go here, ask for him. You will be amazed. I felt like I was in a Saturday Night Live skit ""The Truly Amazing Waiter"" He was that good! Don't forget to leave him a handsome tip. This guy should be cloned!"
August 1, 2015|Fresh sushi at its finest|4|We shared a sushi boat as well as some other sushi rolls. All of the fish was fresh, served at the appropriate temperature, and most important of all, tasty. Service was relaxed & friendly. The bar was lively & fun.
July 31, 2015|Good food excellent service|5|Waiter top notch great recommendations from the menu delicious food
July 25, 2015|service|5|The food was delicious, the service was even better. Will definitely return.
July 14, 2015|The food didn't live up to our expectations.|3|Steak tartar was chunky and bland. Bone marrow dish was overdone. Sushi rolls were not bad.

May 29, 2015|Excellent|5|Sushi is out of this world! We enjoyed the food, drinks and our waiter was awesome

May 23, 2015|This place is awesome!|5|In the past month we have been to 10 twice and recommended others go there who also raved about the food. My husband and I went for the steak, but the sushi sounded so delicious, we decided to opt for sushi only. We were not disappointed on either visit. I prefer the Crunchie Munchie with soybean paper instead of seaweed paper. It was very filling and delicious with a few different tastes to it. We enjoyed the half drinks that are just as potent as a full drink. They are mostly fruity ades with vodka. We will probably go here before theater from now on. We sent friends from the west coast to try 10, and they said it was simply delicious. By the way, waiters were carrying a lot of steaks with inventive toppings, and they looked good too.
May 16, 2015|First Experience at Ten Prime Steak & Sushi|5|"Found it on the run - quick search - sure glad we found it. we haven't stopped talking about the wonderful food! No doubt, the best steak we've ever had - and the ""to die for"" potatoes ... just that!! What a wonderful experience. No cheap by any means, but well worth every single penny!!"
May 7, 2015|Great spot!|5|We had a wonderful meal and our server Johnny was AMAZING! We told him we were on our way to a show, he asked us a few questions, and then came up with amazing steak and sushi offerings on a platter for us. Everything was delicious and it was the perfect amount of food. Every recommendation he made was right on target, and he was a lot of fun too. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
May 2, 2015|The entire experience was amazing, from ...|5|The entire experience was amazing, from the food to the service. From the skewers and sushi I ordered at the beginning to the 12oz filet later in the meal, it was all very good.
April 24, 2015|Wonderful Birthday Dinner!|5|We went to 10 Steak and Sushi this past Saturday to celebrate my birthday. It was the first visit for all 4 of us and we will definitely be back. The food was wonderful and even better was the service from our server John. He took a fantastic dinner and made it magical with his attention to detail and to our every need. We had the bacon wrapped scallops as an appetizer and they were prepared perfectly. Our steaks were tender and mouth watering. And of course, the Death By Butter Smashed Potatoes were over the top delicious. We ordered the Cotton Candy Creme Brulee to split and it was more than enough for each of us to enjoy our fill. It was presented in perfect birthday fashion with candles, berries and a greeting written in their homemade chocolate sauce. It's honestly hard to find anything to complain about, except maybe the meal had to eventually end. I recommend you check out this downtown gem!
April 18, 2015|unexpected find|4|our first trip to Providence but this spot worth the trip. Seems to be popular with locals. Busy bar scene and the food was very good. a little further a walk than other restaurants but worth it.
April 15, 2015|Never fails to deliver|4|5th time there and each experience has been excellent. Best veal chop ever.

March 22, 2015|Not cheap but worth the money|4|We had a great experience. Service was prompt and attentive and the food was excellent. We would go back. From soup to sashimi, skewers and steak to sea bass, it was all delicious.
March 21, 2015|Excellent|5|This was out first time out at Prime, and I can't wait to go back. Everything was excellent from the very beginning from our greeting, the bar service, and our waiter was top notch. Food was great, and desserts were the best! We will be back.
Dined on March 13, 2015|Ten is always top notch|5|Ten is consistently a great dining experience. The staff genuinely care that you have a great meal and a great time. They make you feel special. I recommend asking for Johnny as your server.
March 12, 2015|excellent restaurant|3|the best sushi in the city good for business meetings and friend
March 8, 2015|great little find|5|Unassuming from the outside, this place is a little gem. Down a side street (Pine Street) in the center of providence you will find Ten Prime. The menu is diverse and interesting, somewhere between steakhouse and asian fusion. Our server was super, attentive without being smothering. We started with the mini skewers of shrimp, chicken and beef which were perfect to start the meal. great flavors to get you ready for the main event. I also had the seaweed salad which was perfectly dressed and seasoned served in a martini glass. One us opted for the swordfish with lump crab and sweet potato hash which was a perfect balance of flavors and textures to compliment the perfectly cooked swordfish. The second entree was the sesame crusted sushi grade tuna over a vegetable quinoa with pea tendrils, edamame and yuzu sauce. this dish is amazing. the nuttiness of the quinoa with the sweet tangy yuzu sauce and brightness of the edamame and teadrills is a perfect compliment to the lightly seared tuna. Banana bread pudding and chocolate souffle completed the evening. Both were fantastic. Plenty of flavor and comfort in the banana bread pudding without being heavy and cloying. The chocolate souffle was exquisitely executed. Great dark chocolate flavor, perfectly cloud like topped with a creme anglaise which pushed the experience to heavenly. It is hard to find good souffle now a days and this place has done it. Highly recommend this place. we are already planning a trip back to do the steak side of the menu.
February 28, 2015|Pleasant place|5|It is a small restaruant but the interior is quite nice. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. First visit would definitely go again. Valet parking on weekends garages also nearby.
February 26, 2015|Won't Disappoint|5|Had some local oysters to start followed by a few of the designer sushi rolls with a nice bottle of wine. The food & service were fantastic. Can't wait to go back.
February 19, 2015|Great Sushi|5|We had a great time sharing different sushi selection among seven people. Food was excellent.
February 18, 2015|Super Yummy!!|5|I've already eaten here twice in two weeks, absolutely amazing. The appetizers are fun and creative, I love the party of many skewers and the beef hot rock. The sushi is downright delicious! The prime roll, crunchy munchie, and taki maki are my favorite rolls. Steaks always seem to be cooked perfectly, they melt in your mouth. The desert list is on the smaller side, but what's available is awesome. The staff are all very friendly, and know just when to pop in. I plan on eating here at least once a month.
January 17, 2015|Delicious food, top notch service, great location!|4|Reservations were during resturant week. I had tenderloin from the prefix menu. It was perfect portion size for me. I ordered medium but it was just a snitch past perfect pink, still delicious. The chowder was creamy and tasty too but too small a portion. My husband has the lobster tail and filet with a salad and mashed potatoe side. The salad was only greens, no veggies at all. The meat was melt in your mouth delicious and a hearty portion. The potatoes were so creamy with a crusted bit of mflred cheese. Excellent. Our deserts were both bread puddings. It was so yummie. Highly recommend ordering and sharing one its a high portion Presentation was nice, I noted a birthday celebration when reserved and the table had confetti on it when we were seated. The desert plate was almost as wide as the table with a personalized birthday message in caramel and chocolate. Very nice touch. Johnny our server was attentive, charming, personable and made the experience even better! Tables are a bit too close if you wanted a private conversation and overall a bit pricey. The mojito was a disappointment but the wine made up for it. i would come again.

January 11, 2015|Noisy (music loud) but nice!|4|Went first nice of Restaurant week - nice 3 course menu offering. Crunchy Shrimp Maki App very good - but too much mayo drizzled on top. Calamari Rhode Island Style tasty - but looked frozen? Very regular shaped - cornmeal crust. Not sure. Sliced filet cooked perfectly and the Pan Roasted Chicken was very nicely cooked with a crunchy skin. Wine list excellent but quite expensive. Music level way too loud and a bit overbearing. Service attentive (not too busy on Sunday night due to football?) This place is pretty expensive.
January 9, 2015|Will come back|4|Our server was happy to cater to our sushi requests and was super attentive. Great experience!
January 3, 2015|My favorite Providence restaurant|5|Food and service is always top notch. You truly feel like a guest. Love it there.
December 31, 2014|The special dinner goto!|4|Third time there with my wife. Food always spot on and designer sushi rolls are always delish. Love the atmosphere and service is on top of things but they never hover. Little pricey but that is why it is our special goto place.
December 31, 2014|Fabulous, trendy but elegant.|5|We had reservations for New Years Eve which is also our Anniversary. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our server, Johnny T. was great and very knowledgeable of the complete wine, bar, sushi and dinner menu. Our drinks were great and our food was delicious and elegantly served. The ambiance was amazing with lighting & music. Impeccably clean 100% We will definitely visit again when we are in town.
December 28, 2014|Too Good to Miss|5|Always wonderful. Incredible ingredients cooked perfectly. intelligent, well informed staff that really strives to deliver without fanfare but with style and good humor. Our special thanks to the kitchen for preparing ye olde salmon dish with couscous that we so love...just really superb. Thanks, too, to our server who repeatedly anticipated our every need...Happy New Year to all...
December 12, 2014|Good. not great|4|"The restaurant seems to do a better job on th sushi side than the steak in my opinion. My ""prime"" NY strip did not appear or taste like ""Prime"" compared to Morton's or Flemmings. It was done exactly as I had directed (very rare) so there's that. One of our party had the Tuna and it was perfect. Our waiter was very good and made our visit most enjoyable."
November 15, 2014|Frozen|4|Food was excellent as always but temperature was set at 63 degress (we sat right next to the thermostat). We figured it was for the wait staff's comfort and we asked him to change it but he basically ignored us. It made it very unconfortable for us as diners; ruined the meal. Dont go in the winter time unless you bring a heavy coat
November 15, 2014|Dined here for a birthday dinner and the...|4|Dined here for a birthday dinner and the restaurant really helped to make it a special evening and our server was fantastic! Sushi/fish portion of the menu was very good. Not your typical steakhouse and meat a little overcooked but worth the visit. Dessert took longer than expected but was very tasty. Overall, we were very satisfied and would return.
November 8, 2014|BEST STEAK & SUSHI EVER!!|5|This place is fantastic from the point of making our reservation online to paying our check!! My boyfriend and I were going to be late due to unexpected traffic, I called and they happily moved our reservation for us. the wait staff was so warm, welcoming and attentive. The drinks were great! The food was so flavorful and delicious. There wasn't anything we had that we did not love. Truly a party in our mouths. I could go on and on. We will be coming here again!
November 8, 2014|A traffic accident and a Water Fire made...|5|A traffic accident and a Water Fire made us 40 minutes late for our reservation. We had tickets to a play. The restaurant and wait staff were so accomodating. They rushed our order through but didn't make us feel rushed. Food was excellent. They recuscued what would have been a disastorious evening into a memorable one. Thank you.
November 7, 2014|Maybe an off night|3|We usually love our meals at 10 but tonight it wasn't that great. Steak was a little tough and the sushi didn't seem as fresh as usual. We will be back for another try.
October 25, 2014|Great first date spot|4|Thoroughly enjoyed everything: Food, service, and ambiance. Small enough to feel romantic, and the bar was busy all night. Will be back.
October 12, 2014|Fantabulous!!|5|We always visit Ten Prime before the season opening show at PPAC and have NEVER been disappointed. The food, the people and the location are all excellent! And this time was no exception!
October 11, 2014|Good Food and Service|4|Restaurant has good food and good service. Hospitable wait staff that aims to please. They are knowledgable and make you feel comfortable. You're served in an efficient and timely manner. Sushi and steak were good. Oysters and crabmeat were fabulous too! Nice location in regards to watching Waterfire after. Easily accessible!
October 11, 2014|Perfect every time|5|We had a bunch of apps to start the skewers, truffle fries, sushi all were great. Dinner I had bone in filet which was a special meet was perfect texture the Mac and cheese is always a hit as a side. We were celebrating a birthday Johnny our amazing waiter brought her dessert Beautifully displayed she was so excited. He is by far the best waiter I have had at this restaurant.
October 11, 2014|Awesome!|5|Outstanding Service and a really fun, diverse menu.
October 10, 2014|Dinner|3|The Sushi was fabulous as always. We ordered 2 Sushi dishes for appetizers. The service was a bit sluggish for the amount of people in the restaurant. My wife and daughter ordered a sushi dish and the meatloaf to be served as their dinner which they intended on splitting. Unfortunately, they were served their Sushi 5 Min. before the main dishes came out. I ordered the Wagyu steak and was disappointed at how tough it was. I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times and this was the first time it wasn't spectacular.
October 4, 2014|amazing|5|This was the best meal my husband and I have had in long time. We will definitely be back. Drinks, wine list, food, everything was delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable and helped us choose the perfect bottle of wine.
October 4, 2014|Ten is a 10 again and again|5|Great service and great food. Ask for Johnny as a server and try the Crunchy Munchy .
September 30, 2014|gary|3|Sushi was very good, Steaks were good, but not worth the menu price...
September 27, 2014|great food|5|First time here and the expectations were met. Food was delicious and service was fast. Worth the price. Atmosphere was very comfortable and bright. Would recommend to friends and will be back.
September 27, 2014|Food took an hour to get to our table. W...|2|Food took an hour to get to our table. While waiting we weren't even offered bread until 45 minutes later. Waiter only came that once in that waiting period to offer more drinks. When he did come he said our food would be right out but wasn't for another 15 minutes. Was there for a birthday dinner but wasn't impressed. The tables were so close together we had no privacy.
September 21, 2014|Sushi|5|Prime roll & crunchie munchie roll are outstanding
September 20, 2014|quality but expensive|4|We enjoyed our dining experience. The food was of good quality, but on the expensive side probably due to being located in downtown Providence. The noise level was a bit too loud, and not to our liking.
September 19, 2014|Spectactular Food|5|Ten never disappoints the food is always over the top The steak flavor is exceptional here. No have had almost everything on the menu except the sushi which everyone I am with always says it's perfect. Heading out for a drink this place has a very busy bar and can make a perfect cosmopolitan everytime looking forward to next time!
September 13, 2014|Great food as always. Service was overbe...|4|Great food as always. Service was overbearing- too many servers as it was not busy. Our plates kept being taken before we were through. We ended up feeling rushed even though there were empty tables.
September 12, 2014|Not as good as this time...|3|Last year I was wowed by my first experience at Ten, which was part of the Taste Trekkers mystery restaurant evening. Everything was fabulous, from the app to the filet to dessert. This time was just OK, at least for half the party. My date's food, swordfish, was fine. My scallops came out overcooked the first time. The staff, including the manager, was apologetic and offered to make a new plate. When the second plate arrived, the scallops were undercooked and completely cold in the center. That was disappointing. I didn't order it a third time and the meal was taken off the bill. Maybe I'll try it a third time.
September 6, 2014|Impressive|5|We had an amazing time and they had so many small and special touches to the evening since it was for my husband's birthday. They had an origami rose, confetti on the table, said happy birthday once we sat down, decorated our dessert tray with happy birthday and had a candle on it. So sweet all around. Food was DIVINE...sushi was phenomenal and lobster potstickers..perfect!
September 5, 2014|Yum!|4|Cocktails are incredible, they never fail! Coconut shrimp on skewers were great..chicken and beef seemed a bit dry. Crunchy Munchies specialty roll was fantastic!!! Spicy Tuna roll was good but felt like it needed more of a Mmmmm factor! Love coming back to this place, will visit again!
September 3, 2014|After work office find|4|Ten is a place for city office workers to go and grab a drunk after the work day. Bar is lovely, food is great. When I was having dinner, there was a group behind us that was seriously loud and obnoxious but that's not the restaurants fault.
Dined on August 31, 2014|the best salmon in New England...great s...|5|the best salmon in New England...great staff. food is consistently fresh and well prepared
August 23, 2014|Awesome! =)|5|Only reservation available was 8:45pm and we took it. We knew we would arrive early and decided to see if we maybe able to sit down sooner. Once we arrived at 7:45pm we asked if we could be seated and the hostess was able to accommodate with no problems. We were immediately escorted to the table. The atmosphere had great lighting and an upbeat vibe. Only down fall was the dining tables are very close together. We were greeted quickly and any menu questions we had DAVE was excellent. Food was delicious! We especially LOVED the chocolate souffle! Overall we would absolutely recommend to friends/family. Reminder VALET is complimentary! But don't forget to TIP out they take good care! =) Thank you!!!
August 23, 2014|Simply delicious|5|The appetizers were a great starter. Steak was perfect and the sushi was very fresh. Our waiter Johnny T made our visit so memorable. He was the best
August 23, 2014|Great spot for sushi in Providence|3|"We've been to 10 many times before, and have always had decent food, but the best part of a meal there is the sushi. It's always fresh and they have so many unique and tasty options for everyone's palate. On our latest visit, it was ""Lobsterpalooza"" so a lot of our meals were lobster related. The lobster fra diavolo was fairly tasteless, and the lobster risotto was also not great. The other negative aspect is that the seating is very crowded with the tables very close together, so if your neighbors are even slightly loud, you can't help hearing their whole conversation. It also tends to be a bit noisy, but not overwhelmingly so. On the whole, it's a good place for drinks and appetizers, but the entrees are pricey and not spectacular."
August 22, 2014|What every night out should be like|5|As business executives and parents my fiance and i have rare moments to enjoy a night out. I value the time that my fiance and I have together... and the OUTStanding service by Johnnie & Team combined with a non rushed and chic setting made dining on a badass steak-and sushi meal an experience to relish. We are fortunate that the superior quality food is only enhanced by the staff as any bad experience would leave a bad taste in your mouth regardless of the quality. A true night out.. perfection!
August 16, 2014|Must visit in Providence|5|The restaurant was great, the setting was very mellow and we were promptly served and attended to. I was especially appreciative of the portion sizes and the desert (Banana Bread Pudding)is a must try
August 12, 2014|wasted my time|1|the website had reservations available with last seating at 1030pm. i had dinner res for 1015pm, took taxi across town, arrived on time and expected to dine. when i arrived with my guest, i was informed only the bar menu with sushi was available. i didnt need to make a dinner reservation at a steak place for that!! also, they didnt answer the phone when i tried to call to confirm that it was open. and then at this hour, very difficult to find another restaurant to dine at. VERY ANNOYED!!
August 8, 2014|Excellent!|4|The atmosphere hits you right as you walk in the door. There is a comfortable, but elegant feeling with no sense of artificiality. The food was excellent. There were choices for every palette from sushi to steak. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly. One steak had to be sent back, but it was cooked properly the second time and it was handled quickly and professionally. Would definitely go back again and recommend to friends!
August 8, 2014|Five star!|5|We found this restaurant last year and we loved the food and service. When we were doing college tour for my son in Providence, we said we have to back to Ten Prime steak and sushi. When we got there our waiter was so attentive and very nice. The good was delicious as we remembered it.
July 28, 2014|Worst Service for special event|1|Reserved thro Opentable, specified that this was our anniversary. Our last two anniversaries were celebrated at this restaurant. Service had been great so. On arrival, they wanted to sit us at the table right by the entrance (Reservation Notes?), with the highest traffic. Requested better sitting. There was no table cloth like in previous years, or like at other tables / booths. Evening wasn't going very well so far. After placing our order, the waiter went to the manager and whispered something. They then looked at us in an awkward way. Wasn't best experience. Told MGR we were displeased. Promised to make it right. Even took my number and email address. Still waiting.
July 26, 2014|Great menu had a diverse selection. Not ...|5|Great menu had a diverse selection. Not a typical sushi peson, but tried one of their special sushi rolls and it was excellent. WSould definetly recommend this location. Will be future visits to try some of the other entree's.
July 26, 2014|Perfect date night|5|Great dinner! Everything was cooked perfect. Also great location. Short walk to water fires.
July 22, 2014|Memorable dinner|5|This is a fantastic little gem of a steak and sushi restaurant. Our server, Eric, was gracious and helpful in guiding us through our meal as first time guests. I will try to get back there as soon as possible. Highly recommend reservations on the weekend.
July 18, 2014|A Night Our Taste Buds won't Forget|5|The Food was Remarkable Staff was Great Our Waitress knew all the Right combinations of food & Drinks to Test our Tastes Buds. An Excellent Night
July 12, 2014|We will be back!|4|My wife and I always try different places during restaurant weeks here in Providence. Ten Prime and Sushi delivered for sure. The Sushi app. was awesome, it was a coconut encrusted roll that I could not get enough of. Fortunately my wife does not eat coconut so I had her dish as well. She had the Rock and Roll which also lived up to it's name. The dinner offerings which we had were steak of course. The steak Dianne kept with the classic and did not disappoint, caramelized onions just added to the dish. My steak with lobster and asparagus tips was spot on. Both steaks were cooked to perfection, tender and very flavorful. Definitely another place to add to our got to get back to places. Thanks for a great evening!
July 10, 2014|Great food, okay service.|4|It was my first time dining here for restaurant week. my friend and I walked into the restaurant, no one was there to greet us. I expected a host/ess because there is a host stand there. We waited for about 10 minutes & no one greeted us. there was a bartender/waitress behind the bar there who saw us the whole time since the entrance was literally next to the bar. Finally about 10-15 minutes later she decides to tell us we can sit anywhere we want. There was no hi introduction or how are you. It was my first time so I didn't know that you could seat yourself? Especially since I made reservations for the restaurant. Food took long to come out & there was only 3 tables at the time. However I will say the food was great and the decor is nice.
July 8, 2014|excellent|5|from drinks to appetizers, dinner and desert everything was excellent. You were not rushed through courses as in other restaurants.
July 7, 2014|Best restaurant week meal|5|"Excellent AMAZING food for restaurant week! I've gone to several restaurant week dinners in the past usually leaving disappointed and realizing that the food is designed for ""pre-fixe"" menu. But my experience this time was beyond my expectations. Full sized maki and filet mignon cooked perfectly as I ordered. I've always liked this place but this experience was over the top magnificent."
June 29, 2014|Delicious!|5|Everything was delicious and the manager served us as well and was amazing!
June 27, 2014|excellent|5|We were not disappointed. By anything. The whole meal was excellent. And eric the server was wonderful with the vodka recommendations. Will cerrtainly return.
June 27, 2014|Food always a treat|4|Never a bad meal here. Place is on the small side so if you're looking very a quiet romantic place, this isn't it. But the food is worth it. It's not cheap but I don't mind paying for a higher price if I get higher quality food and service. Will be back again.
June 27, 2014|Ten is always a 10.|5|Great food, fantastic service. A great dining experience. Ask for Johnny as your server.
June 17, 2014|Smashing!|5|My wife and I went to have a nice dinner on a Tuesday evening to celebrate her birthday in hopes that we would have a memorable time. Well, we had a great experience and will undoubtedly be back again as everything was what we had expected and more. We have been out for dinner 100's of times, all over the world and this cracked our all time top 10. I can't tell you anything about the dessert, as it just wasn't possible to push our appetite far enough to squeeze it in. But, outside of that we were more than pleased. So, go to Ten Prime Steak and Sushi for a great dining experience...!
June 11, 2014|The only criticism I would offer is the ...|4|The only criticism I would offer is the tables are close together and you will dine close to a stranger. Also, because of the cramped space a waiter not serving my table repeatedly hit the back of my chair as he passed by and at one point muttered something that I perceived as a display of anger.
June 7, 2014|Great first impression!|5|Being my first visit to this restaurant, I was definitely wowed on all fronts. The ambiance and decor were funky yet sophisticated, the server extremely attentive (without being overbearing) and knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu and dishes, and the food was delectable! There was absolutely nothing that I was disappointed with - I look very much forward to making this a regular dining spot in the future!
June 6, 2014|My husband likes steak and I like Sushi....|4|My husband likes steak and I like Sushi. Perfect place for both of us. The food is excellent, the best white chowder!
June 5, 2014|Great service|5|Went in last night with a Groupon. Had a terrific server named John who was happy to explain how it worked. Good food but even better service. All the Chow Fun restaurants are good but this is one of the best. We're coming back!
June 3, 2014|Food review|3|Ordered the calamari for an app, breading was dull and plain and really had no taste. Calamari was good though, cooked right and was tender. Sushi was excellent. My 22oz porterhouse was overlooked for medium rare but was a good cut of meat and aged nicely. Overall was a good meal. The waiter was very straight and asked us if we wanted our meal when clearly we were done with out appetizers and the wait was long for water and out our dinner. Overall a decent experience, would maybe revisit for sushi.
May 31, 2014|everything and more|5|The food and service was spectacular. The banana bread pudding dessert is to die for!
May 30, 2014|Lots of fun and good food too|4|Hip and delicious. We enjoyed it very much - would recommend it.
May 30, 2014|Best meal ever|5|"I lost my husbands interest in our conversation when the meal came out. In his word (and he's a highly critical foodie) - ""that was the best meal ive ever eaten."""
May 30, 2014|"""Ten"" is a 10.  "|5|Great food and great service. My favorite place. Ask for Johnny as your server.
May 27, 2014|Unique|5|great meal and experience. Went via Groupon for four. Very pleasant and professional, courteous service and also helpful and generous concerning the use of a groupon. Loved the variety on the menu; wish we had room for sushi in addition to our entrees. Would definitely return and recommend. Atmosphere was bright and open, busy.
May 25, 2014|Excellent Sushi and Steaks|5|If you're into sushi and/or high-quality steaks, Ten Prime is a great choice in Providence.
May 24, 2014|Great Sushi|4|Sushi was excellent, chicken chop, tuna and steaks all very good. Modern atmosphere, consistently delicious food. Highly recommend for a special night out.
May 24, 2014|Good dinner spot Great customer svc|4|Went recently to 10 Prime before hitting the Waterfires. Were seated in the back room, which was kind of dark when trying to see the menu, but after that wasn't bad. The server, Connie, was attentive and friendly. I ordered littlenecks, and they were out of malt vinegar. But the manager ran across the street and got a bottle from another restaurant, now THAT is top notched customer service. The food was decent. Creative enough menu, but nothing that would make you have to go back the next night to have again. I would probably go again.
May 22, 2014|Excellent|5|I can't find one bad thing to say about our visit. From the service, to the food (both the suchi and the steaks), to the drinks... and the amazing desserts, it was all excellent. Can't wait to visit again!
May 16, 2014|chilly|2|We sat in the back room which was quieter than the front, but the air was BLOWING on us. Chilly air that actually moved my skirt. Asked twice to have it turned down, our service person did it, but it turned back on a minute or two later. The air chilled our food quickly and our Delmonico steak was not the best quality. Have eaten here many times, just disappointed this time.
May 15, 2014|outstanding|5|Went to celebrate my fiancees bday and we had a blast delicious food great atmosphere and great service
May 15, 2014|Pricey but worth it|5|Our first visit to Ten Prime won't be our last. We enjoyed our sushi and the entrees were top notch. My husband's veal chop and my filet mignon were cooked to perfection. I wish the butter mashed potatoes were more of a standout. Desserts were good but not overly creative. While he apple crisp feeds two the chocolate lava cake is good for one. The chocolate lava cake tasted almost burnt - it was not my favorite.
Dined on May 10, 2014|The food and the service were excellent....|5|The food and the service were excellent. Our server did a wonderful job of taking care of us. The only thing we did not like was our bar cocktail-- a Margarita. It was sub par.
May 9, 2014|Date night find|5|Brought my wife for a birthday dinner and it was the perfect spot. Great ambiance, excellent beverages (try the 888 Vodka drinks!), and the food was top notch. And the best waiter I've ever had.

May 4, 2014|great evening|4|We had a great dinner out, food was outstanding, sushi and steak were prime !! . Only issue was that wait person misunderstood one of our cocktail orders and brought the wrong drink, if he or bartender did not know what drink was they should have come back to the table for details.
May 3, 2014|O.K. Overrated and Trendy |3|Made reservation on line. Arrived 10 minutes early,was told by hostess they were running on time and to enjoy a drink at the bar. Ten minutes later not seated hostess said tables were being set, and we would be seated shortly. Noticed people coming from the entrance seated before our party,at this time we are still waiting to be seated 25 min later. Seems as though regulars get priority. We were finally seated by another hostess and given a lame excuse for being seated 25 min late. Waiter was great on spot,sushi was great,steak was just O.K. chewy, drinks just O.K. Would not highly recommend or be in rush to go back.
May 3, 2014|Good spot before PPAC|4|We had tickets to the PPAC performance. I had informed the restaurant of my gluten allergy and of the engagement following dinner. Our server (Sean) was very attentive. The food was very good, and came out in a timely mannor. We would certainly return.
May 3, 2014|Dindi|3|The noise level was the biggest negative factor for us, music blaring, TV's on (of course it was the Kentucky Derby) My husband very much enjoyed his entre, me not so much, I had the skirt steak, it had little to no flavor. We had a great waiter, Eric, very professional and knowledgeable, nice personality. I would not return as this is mainly a restaurant with a hot bar scene and tables are so close to the bar. Not my favorite in Providence.
May 2, 2014|Good veal|5|My boyfriend and I felt comfortable and we enjoyed the food. The waiter was not friendly but was attentive.
April 30, 2014| we ate the whole thing|4|We went to Ten Prime for the first time. We ordered the sushi boat. It was lovely to look at, and delicious. Our waiter came by after we put in the order, to be sure we wanted that much food. We had no problem finishing it off, as it was just the right amount for the 3 of us. A little pricier than we'd expected, but not more than the going rate at this restaurant.
April 26, 2014|empty pocket, bad attitude |3|We selected your establishment to enjoy a night out to celebrate our anniversary we are sad to say that this is one of the many few times we have had a tab over $200 and awful service our waiter rushed us from the second we sat down. A 45min meal is not particularly a night out we should have went to Boston!
April 23, 2014|All Good|4|The service, the location, the elegantly plain decor, and most importantly the food and bar options were all truly very good. A little pricey but worth it. Also, seemed like good vibes from other tables, not the stiffness of some high-end venues. Not noisy, easy conversation - I'm a little embarrassed to say the table of noise was ours, at one point we were laughing so hard on our monthly get-together outing that we were all in tears (we only had 1 drink each and this was not even half way through that - it was just good company, not the alcohol).
April 20, 2014|Not really a steak place|3|Everything was fine, but since steak is in the name expected more than one variety of steak entree choices
April 19, 2014|I will be back!|5|By far, some of the best service I have ever received. The staff were overly friendly and attentive. The feel throughout the whole restaurant is that the staff were actually appreciative that you were there.
April 19, 2014|first timer|5|This was our first visit to Ten Prime and we were not disappointed. Our server, Eric, was very knowledgeable in Pinot Noir wines and helped us make our selection. Eric also helped me choose my meal and he catered to my dietary needs. We will be returning again. We made this visit using a Groupon and we were extremely happy.
April 18, 2014|before the theater|5|Perfect spot for a meal before the show!!! We all enjoyed the sushi,which is some of the best we have had!
April 12, 2014|Groupon|4|All was excellent but our $300.00 Groupon was not what was offered. Unless all order a $50.00 meal you lose money. cannot apply ala-carte potatoes or vegetables to make up difference. 1 extra appetizer (oysters) 1 salad, 2 ala items cost us 65.00 over the groupon, when we only used 210 of the $300.
April 12, 2014|Sushi was much better than|4|Sushi was much better than steak, which was expensive and lacking in flavor. If you are looking for a great steak, I would recommend Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris. This place is great for sushi, and the ambience is great.
April 7, 2014|10 Prime Steak and Sushi YUM!|5|I have never been disappointed by a meal at this restaurant. Great sushi. I recommend the Crunchie Munchie and Sushi Sandwich. The Seared Ahi Tuna was out of this world. I ask for it with rice rather than mashed. There was more than I could eat for two meals. The desserts are awesome as well. Try the Creme Brûlée. You won't believe how good it is!
April 6, 2014|Wow|5|We went here with friends and had a wonderful time. The food was terrific and our server was awesome. If you go there ask for James. He is friendly and very knowledgeable. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The wagu beef appetizer is to die for. We really enjoyed our evening and we're never rushed. It was a great time. We will certainly go again.
April 5, 2014|almost|4|Wow! Great service, our server and his support team were great! Little touches throughout the night made our anniversary celebration memorable! Food was delicious!! Drinks were perfect! Small misses with service and food... lipstick on my champagne glass, when it was given to me... steaks were delicious but my wife's was a little over done. .. All in all it was a good experience, but for the ticket price, total for my wife and I we could have gone to Craft Steak and been blown away by food and service, but would have had polished silverware, not dinked up stainless restaurant ware, and wouldnt have had to share conversarions with our neighbors... Just... almost....
April 3, 2014|fantastic!|5|everything was exceptional - the service (everyone - the valet, the hostess, waiter and bus staff) and the food - we primarily had shushi and other appetizers. can't wait to go back!
April 1, 2014|Great restaurant, the staff|5|Great restaurant, the staff was perfect. The food was AMAZING, definately a special occasion restaurant.
March 29, 2014|Expensive and not worth it|2|First we ordered Calamari. The calamari was made with corn meal so it felt grainy and not tasty. Then I ordered the Salmon which was dry. My husband had two sushi rolls which were just okay. For the amount of money they charge for entrees we expected better quality. Maybe it was because they were busy. I would rather go somewhere else. It is a really cute place to grab drinks, but that is about it.
March 29, 2014|Relax|3|The food was great and the service was good. My only issue was our $55 steaks came out without sides, salad and wine. After a few minutes I asked the waiter about the rest of our meal and he told me to relax everything would be right out. Everything did come out five minutes after the steaks. I guess they wanted the steaks to cool down, which they did. I will pick a different place next time.
March 29, 2014|Very enjoyable|5|Service was outstanding. Waiter was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Food, from apps to desert were great.
March 22, 2014|A great night out!|5|Overall experience was fantastic! We have been there several times and will keep going back!
March 21, 2014|Favorite|5|I have been to many places over my lifetime and this still is and will always remain my favorite place. Top notch!!!!
March 21, 2014|Lunch|5|Believe it or not, the best meatloaf sandwich in the city.
March 21, 2014|Awesome Steak|5|We had a wonderful time, our server was wonderful, drinks were wonderful, and food outstanding. Can't wait to return.
March 20, 2014|i wish i lived in providence|5|If I did, I would frequent this wonderful restaurant! Sushi and drinks were amazing. Seared ahi dinner was incredible. Yummmmmm
March 15, 2014|Excellent Experience|5|This place was not quite what we expected. Although, we had not heard much about TEN. We thought it might be like Flemings, or capital Grille. The food was wonderful, it was a younger, energetic crowd. Very fun, but not a place to go for a quiet romantic dinner. I recommend the Filet and Lobster. The Au Gratin Spinach was incredible.
March 15, 2014|Steak and sushi at its best!|5|Wine list could use more moderately priced cabs ($75 - $100)
February 21, 2014|I am always satisfied with|4|I am always satisfied with ten! Both the steak and sushi are great. The steak is well priced without compromising quality, the sides are sinful, and the service has always been generous. It gets pretty lively later on a friday and saturday night and is a really great place to go for a late dinner with a group of friends on these days...just make a reservation beforehand!
February 21, 2014|Nice place, but dessert was amazing|3|The food was pretty good. It took a while to get to us. I only note this as we were going to the theater after. Waiter was great. We got the skewers (beef ones were good, the others I could have done without), sushi sandwich (delicious) , tatakki maki (good), and finally this out of this world red velvet cake. I wish I started with that cake it was sooo good. It was a bit on the pricey side, but overall I would go again.
February 16, 2014|best service ever!|5|wow. this place was great! not only was the food out of sight, but our server, Johnny, was the best. I've never had service better anywhere else. try the lava rocks as an appetizer if you go; very unique!
February 14, 2014|Tasty|5|Fantastic sushi and perfectly prepared steaks! What more could you ask for? Highly recommend the Hot Rock appetizer.
February 14, 2014|great for foodies|4|Wonderful atmosphere, superb drinks and food. Only disappointment were the desserts. Otherwise outstanding food.
February 13, 2014|First Impression|5|Had a excellent dinner and service. Atmosphere not too crazy. our table was near bar area which was accompanied by 12 to 15 gentlemen. Very loud. It was defintelt thirsty thursday.
February 12, 2014|Absolutely outstanding|5|enjoyed an early Valentine's dinner and being the 1st time to this restaurant I reccommend this restaurant based on waiter, service, manager and food.
Dined on February 11, 2014|Best Sushi|4|I know this is a notable steakhouse, however in my opinion it is even better for the sushi. The Crunchie Munchie and Grilled Sushi Sandwich are my two favorites and hands down the best rolls I've had anywhere!
February 8, 2014|Fantastic|5|We met our daughter at Ten Prime before a show at the PPAC. We started with the calamari and a spicy tuna roll, both were very good and a good size for sharing. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and wine list. I had the pork osso bucco special my husband had the bone in filet which was also a special. Both were excellent and cooked properly. Our daughter had the bacon wrapped filet which was huge and delicious. We all shared the bread pudding which we were told had just come out of the oven, It did not disappoint! Highly recommend 10 Prime and we will be back.
February 7, 2014|Interesting but could raise the bar|4|Food was very good - beautifully presented, tasty, and ample. Artwork is edgy and lots to look at. Service was mediocre. The waiter didn't take everyone's drink order at the same time (there were three of us). Had to ask for chopsticks several times. When we were leaving there was no one to fetch our coats so we did it ourselves, Service needs to be polished.
February 1, 2014|My wife and I had an early|4|My wife and I had an early dinner on Feb 1, 2014 We always come back to Ten for there outstanding sushi and my wife especially love the banana foster. Our waiter was very knowledgable and attentive. We plan on returning soon.
January 31, 2014|Dessert only|5|We have eaten there in the past and the food was exceptional. We took my niece there for dessert for her Birthday. She was very happy with the whole night. That's why you'll have me as a costumer.
January 25, 2014|Outstanding Service|5|We had never been to Ten Prime and I took my wife for her Birthday as a surprise. We loved the ambience and we given a romantic table which was perfect. The service was outstanding I can't say enough about our waiter Johny he went above and beyond. Our dining experience was wonderful our food came out in a timely manner and was fantastic. I would recommend Prime Ten to anyone who enjoy a pleasant hassle free diner experience.
January 18, 2014|Loved it|5|Fabulous waiter Johnny...food was perfection Not so romantic due to background noise, but had A wonderful evening and dinner.
January 18, 2014|Fantastic!|5|Fun drink list, great sushi and steak as promised in the name, and such great service. Went with a group of six and our openvtable res was waiting and ready upon arrival! Will ref go back!
January 17, 2014|Amazing|5|My coworkers wanted to take a lunch today and decided to take advantage of restaurant week. They had all been to Ten and raved about it. We agreed to go and I was not disappointed! Kate (I believe that was her name), our bartender was super sweet and was able to get our order in fast. The meatloaf wrap is unbelievable. I don't even care for meatloaf or mashed potatoes but for some reason, I had to order it. Maybe because EVERYONE I was with ordered it. It wasn't overly crowded so we got to go straight to the bar. The service was fantastic and I can't wait to take my BF here soon! Yum!
January 8, 2014|Dinner before the show|3|When we were seated we had the wrong menus had to ask for new ones. Food took a while to come out. When it came out it had excellent taste but came out cold. My wife had to ask for her drink twice. I ordered an espresso and never got it. At the end of the dinner I had to go to the server ( who was in a lengthy conversation with other patrons) to ask for my check. We were going to the theater, had a 5:30 reservation for a 7:30 show and felt as though that was plenty of time but still had to rush to get there. Server was very pleasant but needs to be more attentive regarding the patrons. Will try it one more time hoping for a better experience.
January 4, 2014|Perfection!!!|5|From the knowledgeable wait staff to the final dessert, everything was perfect.
December 31, 2013|"""Even here"""|4|You would think that in a high quality steak house, and paying nearly 50 bucks for a steak, the chef could get it right. Don' t get me wrong, this is a great place. We came last New Years Eve also, but When you order a filet medium rare, you want it medium rare. Not medium,not medium well. You all know how long it takes to get another when you send it back. Everyone else at the table is almost done,and you don't have yours yet. I would expect this from other places, but not here. Every thing else was perfect. Great table in the window, Good server. Sushi great, drinks perfect. But the Star of the night didn't show ? It was cold out so she stayed on the grill a little too long.
December 27, 2013|Above and Beyond|5|10 is one of our favorite places. No exception this time - perfectly prepared food, great table, attentive staff. Brought friends who also offered rave reviews. During the latter part of the evening my wife had a medical emergency (nothing to do with anything served by this restaurant) causing her to become unconcious and require emergency services. Staff immediately focused on support of paramedics. Harrison Elkhay (10 GM) managed the surrounding scene allowing med personnel to perform their work. All is well with wife, she was able to eventually leave after being cared for. Thanks to all at 10, our close friends support (thanks, Janice!), the Providence FD, and the off-duty Miriam Hospital ER nurse who rushed to my wife's aid.
December 27, 2013|Good time|3|First time dining here. Good atmosphere. Friendly service. Great favored food but small portions for costs.
December 27, 2013|Consistently exceptional!|5|Crunchy munchie-excellent Filet-excellent Baked stuffed lobster- excellent Service very good
December 26, 2013|fantastic|5|Awesome all around. Went for an anniversary dinner before a show at PPAC; would go again anytime.
December 16, 2013|Great little restaurant in|5|Great little restaurant in Providence. Usually get the steak which is amazing, went with sushi this time, and it was better than expected. If you like rolls, get the crunchy munchy. Great atmosphere, great food, my favorite place in Providence.
December 7, 2013|Special|5|Great little place with a hip vibe. Ample parking plus valet. Friendly and attentive staff. Food was perfectly prepared and plated nicely. Desert was amazing and the perfect ending to a wonderful experience. Can't wait to return again. Must stop if you are a steak and sushi lover.
December 5, 2013|Crunchy Munchie|3|We tried this restaurant for my partner's birthday. Prices were steep, so I wouldn't recommend this establishment if purely craving sushi—cheaper alternatives exist in Providence. However, the service was well-timed and on par with the price. The decor of the restaurant was strangely whimsical, but our server's recommendations of the Crunchy Munchie and Morris rolls were fabulous for what they were: gourmet sushi rolls. The seaweed salad was good as well, but the portion size was rather small for its price. Overall, my partner and I probably would not return, but the overall experience was pleasant for us both.
December 4, 2013|Yum!|5|We went for my husband's birthday. The sushi was some of the best we have ever had. We also both orders steaks. They were cooked perfectly and also delicious. We can't wait to go back again!
November 30, 2013|Son's 18th Birthday dinner|5|This is our family favorite as they have something for everyone and are willing to get us a great table depending on the size of our group. Great app's, great dinners and fun drinks along wih a solid wine menu. Add in some of our favorite waiters and it's a winning combination.
November 26, 2013|Delicious Dining|4|The Steaks were amazing. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed. The price was a bit steep.
November 17, 2013|Sunday afternoon (5:30 pm);|5|Sunday afternoon (5:30 pm); quiet; great service; great food; excellent wine list; no Titos vodka
November 9, 2013|Very good food, but very loud|4|We visited 10 Prime Steak and Sushi for a special anniversary dinner. The service was attentive and fantastic. The sushi (spicy tuna roll) was the best I've had. The salads were crisp, cold and fresh. The filet was tender and flavorful, if a little overcooked. The loaded mashed potatoes were to die for!!! The dessert we ordered to share -- banana bread pudding with homemade icecream -- was fantastic (as was the coffee). The only downside was the noise level. The music was pounding, so it was hard to have a conversation. Not the place for a quiet romantic dinner, but still we had an enjoyable night out.
November 8, 2013|Good time great steak|5|He had a great time, great service, great food. We will definitely go again.
November 2, 2013|Very good, no disappointments here|4|Our second visit here. Everything was very good. Good service, great food, reasonable prices. I'll be back to try the sushi.
October 26, 2013|"service was sloooow

food"|2|service was sloooow food was coooold will not go back there
October 26, 2013|Excellent service|3|"Noisy ""bar"" restaurant(front of the house ) Unremarkable steakhouse fare Our server Johnny was the saving grace...attentive and unobtrusive and a trooper who made up for the long delays in the swamped kitchen"
October 26, 2013|We had not been there in a|3|We had not been there in a long time so we thought we would try it. The food was OK but we have had better for the price. The service was just OK, not great. It was definately to loud in the restaurant, and the tables were too close to each other. I felt like we were having dinner with the people next to us. Probably won't go back for a long time,
October 25, 2013|Great food a bit loud|4|The food was second to none. From the lobster potstickers to the delicious apple and oatmeal crumb. We had sushi rolls for dinner mine had filet on it and it was out of this world. The waiter was great and attentive he even recommended triple 8 Vodka from Nantucket and the martinis were splendid. The only negative would be the 2 guys at the table next to us who were repeatedly in our conversation and trying to impress my dining partner. Tables a little too close together but everything else is fantastic!
October 25, 2013|Great Food|4|Delightfully friendly waitress and wonderful food. Nice ambience, the whole nine.
October 25, 2013|preppac|5|great dining experience, menu and wine selection, our server was Christina, very attentive and informative on menu and selections; Fri nite filet specials nice extra.
October 19, 2013|Saturday my girlfriend birthday|5|Saturday my girlfriend birthday was really nice and Ten Prime set the tone very nicely to the climax of the evening. We only been in Rhode Island a few months in newport, and I got big points finding the restaurant on my Ness app. So thanks Ness and Ten Prime for a match made well.
October 12, 2013|Excellent Everything|5|Food, service, drinks and happy birthday presentation of dessert was awesome.
October 12, 2013|One of our Providence favorites|5|We have been going here for 12 years for special dinners. Cannot go wrong with anything. The potato sides are fantastic. The food is great but the ambience is not stuffy. Love it.
October 11, 2013|Great steak and sides|4|Great steak, delicious sides, OK service. I'm not a fan of everything being a la carte, but the sides are definitely worth getting. The tables are a bit on top of each other, and our waitress was not very attentive, but the food made up for it. The Filet Fridays are a good deal
October 5, 2013|Johnny the waiter|5|I have been to 10 several times in the past and never been disappointed but this time I had a waiter named Johnny. He was absolutely awesome and made a great experience even better. I will be back again soon and will be asking for Johnny!
October 4, 2013|Great Spot for Some Good Food|5|We happen upon this place for two reasons. We were going to PPAC, it was close and we had a gift card. It turned out to be a really nice dinner. I can see it being a nice restaurant/bar for a late 20 early 30 crowd. We are an older group and we were there early so it was quiet before the real night time people. The music was not our favorite but it was low/background so we could have a nice conversation without yelling. What made it great for us was the service and the food. Our waiter was great at answering our questions and making recommendations. The food we had was fantastic. Will admit, we are not major foodies as we don't get out much, but we enjoyed the Surf & Turf and the Swordfish. 5 stars for food 5+ stars for service.
September 28, 2013|Great restaurant! Always love|5|Great restaurant! Always love a great steak house but to have sushi in addition was fantastic. Ten Prime has a great modern vibe, and the food from appetizer to dessert was outstanding! The service could not have been better. I have had dinner in Providence many times and this experience was the best! Highly recommend Ten Prime Steak and Sushi.
September 28, 2013|Great service and good food|4|Our waiter at 10 Prime was fantastic. He helped us navigate the menu and offered some delicious specials. The food was good, but not great. For the price I would have expected a little better food (particularly the side dishes). The drinks were great though and overall it was a very good experience!
Dined on September 21, 2013|Best service in a very long time!|4|Sean was a wonderful bonus to an already anticipated delicious evening! He was the perfect combination of attentive, thoughtful, funny and entertaining! My restaurant mantra is that is you go to a restaurant and the food is ok (or even lousy - which this was not!!), you will return if you are treated well. HOWEVER, if the food is excellent but the service is terrible, you will not give it another shot! Sean will keep us going back for years to come!! By the way, the food was excellent as well!
September 8, 2013|Fantastic!!|5|Our favorite restaurant prior to a PPAC show. Have been numerous times and NEVER been disappointed!
September 1, 2013|Such Good Sushi!!!|4|Boston to Providence isn't much of a haul but considering there are plenty of sushi restaurants in Boston, I must say the sushi at 10 Prime makes it worth the drive. Must have the Sushi Sandwich! Also good is the Crunchie Munchie.
August 27, 2013|Slow service, mediocre sushi|2|The beer was flat and I had to order a replacement tapped at higher pressure. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, but slow, we waited 15 min before someone took drink orders and close to an hour for the food. My date said the steak was good, but on the small side (it was cooked correctly). My sushi was bad. Too warm, Nigiri pieces were tiny and vastly overpriced at $6 per pair, the Wasabi was so dry that it almost didn't dissolve and had a brown outside, indicating it's been stored forever. Sushi rice was too chewy, too sticky on the outside and almost hard on the inside. Maki rolls were cut into 6 rather than 8 pieces, making them too big for my very sizable mouth. I can't recommend this place, at least not for its sushi.
August 24, 2013|Great Night|5|We went for our anniversary, had a great pear martini and a ridiculous corn soup!! My wife had the scallop special and I had the lamb. I can not say enough, other than if your in Providence and looking for a great place, come here!!
August 10, 2013|Superb food and service|5|our party tried a variety of sushi and rolls, which were all superb, as well as the steaks served. Ambience was great and service was impeccable and non pushy, it took us quite a while to decide what to order. The sides were delicious too.
August 10, 2013|Spectacular!|5|My second time and the food was outstanding! I can't wait to go back!
August 8, 2013|Good choice!|4|Took a client here for dinner and drinks. It was very good on both fronts. Even though we reserved a table, we ended up eating at the bar. Fun atmosphere, good waitstaff. Will return for sure.
August 5, 2013|Good, diverse experience|4|We had a good business dinner for a team of 7. The mix of sushi and steak house items gave everyone good choices. The noise level was acceptable, even with a full bar. Would definitely recommend for future dinners.
August 3, 2013|This was a fantastic restaurant.|4|This was a fantastic restaurant. We went there based on a recommendation from a friend to celebrate my husbands birthday. Our waitress was friendly, engaging, and gave wonderful recommendations. She was attentive but not smothering. The food was outstanding. We did sushi appetizers and everyone's meal with delicious. We arranged in advance for a dessert and had a great birthday dinner!
August 3, 2013|Exceptional meal!!!|5|We returned to this restaurant after several years of hiatus. To our surprise we realized this place is a gem. My husband and I decided to return because a friend of mind is a bartender and raved about the food!!! I plan on going back on a regular basis.
July 28, 2013|Reserved thro Opentable, specified that ...|1|Reserved thro Opentable, specified that this was our anniversary. Our last two anniversaries were celebrated at this restaurant. Service had been great so. On arrival, they wanted to sit us at the table right by the entrance (Reservation Notes?), with the highest traffic. Requested better sitting. There was no table cloth like in previous years, or like at other tables / booths. Evening wasn't going very well so far. After placing our order, the waiter went to the manager and whispered something. They then looked at us in an awkward way. Wasn't best experience. Told MGR we were displeased. Promised to make it right. Even took my number and email address. Still waiting.
July 25, 2013|Great dinner|4|Went for our anniversary. Got right in with reservations at 7:30. Service was incredible. We took our time and were not rushed in the least. Had yaki maki or something like that sushi rolls for an appetizer. They were fabulous. I had steak which was great. The lobster was okay. Should have had a different side. Wife had sesame tuna which was cooked perfectly. The service was great. Even gave us a free desert for our anniversary. We will be back again.
July 20, 2013|Nice|5|Very nice place to dine I've been there twice and would recomend this restaurant highly.
July 19, 2013|Off night?|3|I have dined at Ten many times and have always been impressed with the food, service, etc. However this particular evening our waitress was not very attentive. We were rarely asked if we would like another cocktail, even though our glasses were empty, and we sat for 35 minutes after our dinner plates had been cleared before she returned. We had planned to order to dessert, but decided to head to Circe for dessert and drinks due to our waitress. The restuarant was not very busy, so there was no excuse for the lack of service. Next time (and there will be a next time because Ten is usually outstanding) I will request a different server.
July 18, 2013|Never disappoints|5|My girlfriend and I love this place!!! Drinks, food, service and atmosphere were all on point. Thank you so much for a great night.
July 17, 2013|Great|5|Both food and service were great. It was our first time here but won't be the last. Also has great late night bar crowd.
July 13, 2013|Great place will be going|4|Great place will be going back again. Our group loved everything about it.
July 12, 2013|Perfect Spot|5|Had the price fixe restaurant week meal for $29.95 which was great. Appetizer, entree and dessert. All not only delicious but beautifully prepared. Not a crumb left on anyone's plate!
July 5, 2013|Forgot How Good This Place Was|5|Went for dinner and had some appetizers and sushi. Everything was excellent, especially with the lava cake with espresso ice cream to finish: fantastic!
July 1, 2013|Bad service !!!!|1|No one @ door to greet us- we had to stand there & wait. The waitress did not know what she was doing !! Took forever to serve my cocktail . We had to ask where it was . She came back and said someone else took it & they were going to make me another one. Served me the wrong one. Came back with right one but no olives. She got the olives but they were the wrong ones . Came back with the right ones. It was CRAZY !!! It almost felt like it was a joke - LOL !! Then we ordered a boat & an extra order of sushi that was supposed to be together. The boat came out without the extra order . She did bring it out later. When the bill came they took off the cocktail & extra order of sushi. Maybe it was her first night ??? She was nice though.
July 1, 2013|Yummy, a bit loud|4|"We had an excellent experience. The wait staff were fantastic, the drinks were well made, and the food was delicious. One exception - the appetizer ""Party of Many Sticks"" shish-ka-bob was a little overcooked. The steaks were perfect. Having the bar right next to our table made things a little loud, but it's a great place overall."
June 20, 2013|Always tasty, if a little expensive|4|"Truffle cheese fries are to die for. Sushi is fresh and creative. Meat dishes are top notch. Fun atmosphere. Deep and extensive wine list, with many cool 'limited edition' options. Very ""alternative-lifestyle"" friendly. Service was great. Corkage fee is high, should you want to bring your own wine."
June 15, 2013|Ten was a 10 again...|5|We had my daughters 22 birthday dinner there. Ten is our favorite b-day spot and they didn't disappoint us. Food is consistently awesome and staff is always great.
June 7, 2013|Pricey|3|Food was good but overpriced, close to $55 per entrée. Service was poor. Server mixed up the martini pours. Sushi order was incorrect and delivered without soy sauce and missing one of our party's appetizers. One of our steaks was overcooked.
June 1, 2013|A little disappointing|4|My wife and I bother ordered steak. She had a filet and I had a porterhouse. I ordered mine medium rare and she medium well. Both steaks arrived at the table very over cooked. The server was tremendous. She got the manger involved and she offered to have new steaks prepared. We did not want to wait so we just ate them as they were. They took my wife's meal off the bill and gave us a couple of cappuccinos. The food was tasty. However, when I spend $98.00 for a steak, it shouldn't come well done when I order it medium rare. Again, server was great. Still disappointed with the restaurant .
May 31, 2013|Nice place|4|Took my girlfriend here for her birthday, food was great! Service was also top notch. Food was a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, and everything was excellent
May 26, 2013|Amazing waiter|5|I had a great waiter. He knew the best things on the menu. He was right. Great food, great mojitos, and great experience. I would go again. Both the sushi and steak were excellent. De@th by mashed potatoes were good too.
May 26, 2013|Great food, funky ambiance|5|Our group ordered both sushi and steak items -- steaks cooked just right (brandy cream sauce DELICIOUS) and sushi presented beautifully. Lobster potsticker appetizer extremely flavorful, as was Party of Many Skewers (fun presentation!). Wonderfully unstuffy decor and ambiance, and service was perfect -- helpful but not overly hovering. Great evening.
May 26, 2013|Service better than food|4|We went here with our group of 5 adults for dinner on a Sunday. The waiter was great.... very responsive and friendly! However, my daughter ordered the large filet, and I ordered the small filet. Not only were they exactly the same size, but hers was supposed to be cooked the same as mine, medium rare, and it was medium. She was starving and did not send it back. Sushi was excellent. I like the bar more than the food overall. Would recommend for bar/drinks and sushi only.
May 25, 2013|Not seated within 45min of arrival|1|We looked forward to this dinner all day. We arrived for our Open Table reservation on time, however we could not be seated for 45 minutes. As a result we went around the block and had a delicious dinner at Circe. The hostess admitted to deliberately overbooking the restaurant despite Open Table reservations. The manager then denied what the hostess had already told us. There are many great restaurants in Providence, and Ten Prime might even be among them, but I'll never know. Recommend go to an establishment that respects Open Table and seats you within a reasonable time of arrival.
May 25, 2013|Fantastic sushi|5|I have never had a bad meal here! Highly recommend the Morris Roll, Crunchie Munchie, and Macand cheese is to die for
May 20, 2013|10 Prime-on food not on wine|4|"The food at 10 Prime was very good. The food was prepared well, served graciously, and consumed in a very pleasant environment. It is a different experience than the ""chain"" steakhouses, and the presence of sushi sets it apart. What sets 10 Prime behind the ""big boys"" is in the wine list. It is lacking in variety not only from a breadth standpoint, but also in hitting all the price points. For a steak house (which is what I would slot it as) there were not many ""big"" reds. No Petite Sirah, very limited on cabs (in a reasonable price point of say $45-$70) and nothing ""unique"" to get excited about."
May 10, 2013|Losing its appeal|3|"We've been going to this 10's since it opened. We've had anniversary, birthday and romantic dinners over the years. We've also recommended it to several friends as a better alternative to the more nationally known steak houses in the city. However, the cramped table settings (we had 5 people crambed into a crescent booth made for 4 people) seems like it's going the way of ""feed and turn over the tables"" mentality. The quality of the steak has gradually deteriorated. I had a 12 ounce filet that was clearly undercut - in the past it was always a generous cut. The last several dinners have been a disappointment from what the restaraunt was when it first hit the scene in providence. I truly hope the ownership wakes up and gets it back in track."
May 5, 2013|Ten Prime is a 10|5|Eric was pleasant and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients and preparation. We opted for sushi apps (the sushi sandwich, a shrimp tempura maki) as well as the lobster pot stickers. The presentation was gorgeous and the fish was fresh and very tasty. I am not a lobster fan, but the potstickers were amazing. One member of my party got sashimi (salmon, tuna, etc.). The bacon wrapped filet and the wagyu beef were cooked perfectly. We shared the creamed spinach and the smashed potatoes. The ten year old with us announced her birthday and Eric returned to the table with a dessert feast: chocolate lava cake, bananas foster bread pudding and house made cotton candy, decorated with candles.
May 4, 2013|Great Night|5|Last saturday 6pm reservation, Katie was our server. Food was excellent in presentation, quality and taste. Sushi was very good, and the special of short ribs was great. Planning on going again soon.
April 26, 2013|Food was very good, service|4|Food was very good, service was even better. Will definitely be back.
April 6, 2013|Great food and service as|5|Great food and service as always, been here many times and have never had a single complaint.
April 6, 2013|I love 10 but I feel like|5|"I love 10 but I feel like many of the tables are too close. We were there before the crowds and maybe 4 tables were being used and the hostess sat a couple right next to us. They actually asked if they could sit a few tables down but the hostess said no.The woman thought I was offended that she asked not to be sat near us but I said ""don't worry I feel the same! They always stick couples next to each other when the restaurant is empty!"" Maybe management can come up with a better way to do the seating. Icould see if they couldn't use the other tables because they were needed for a bigger party but they weren't pushed together.

Dined on March 30, 2013|Excellent restaurant overall.|4|Excellent restaurant overall. Only real complaint was waiter could have been better. (On prior occasion had an excellent waiter. Maybe waiter just had a bad day). To my inexpert opinion, sushi very good. All six of us really liked the entrees (I had superb scallops). Good deserts.

March 23, 2013|Number 1 Choice in Providence|5|My friends and I have been dining at Ten for a few years now and I have to say, we have never had a bad experience or a bad meal. The service is fabulous and the food is amazing! My favorites - Hot Rocks and Crunchier Munchie appetizers. The steaks are also delicious, very tender and cooked perfectly to order. When I'm asked where to go in Providence, Ten is always my first recommendation. Keep up the great work!

Server said happy birthday to my husband as soon as we sat down! And he was honest about what he likes and didn't like on the menu. Great night but pricey!
March 21, 2013|Not good|1|My Swordfish tasted like chicken, it had no flavor and was overly cooked. The sushi we ordered was very average but our bill was much more then average. The quality of the food did not match the high price of the bill. The only memorable part of our dining experience was our nice waitress.

She is a seafood and steak lover and I am a sushi lover, though i love all the food here. We always get the Hot Rocks which are such a unique treat and rather affordable considering the quality and quantity of the Wagyu/Koby beef slices. The heriloom tomato salad is great. We also had some oysters, littlenecks and shrimp.The oysters were extremely good. I had Sea Bass and Yellow tail Ngiri as well as Spider roll and Ranibow roll. All exceptional and served with Scirachi and cabbage.My wife had the Day boat scallops which included several large chunks of fresh lobster tail meat.We had several cocktails and creme brulee with cotton candy

February 16, 2013|Something Missing|3|Something didn't click at Ten Prime. There seemed to be something missing. Wait staff was friendly and attentive but the food took a very long time to be served. Entrees came out 35 minutes after appetizers were finished. Wait staff kept apologizing for the delay. Food was good but not worth the price and certainly not worth the wait. Manager did not seem interested in customer's experience.
February 16, 2013|The food was great, except|5|The food was great, except for the lobster potstickers which were chewy and dry. We had an app, salad, sushi, steak and sides. They were all amazing. The waiter was well informed and helpful. The only complaint I had was the tables were a little close together! I would go back again on a date or for a fancy birthday dinner!

January 19, 2013|My boyfriend and I were visiting|5|My boyfriend and I were visiting from Boston. We found that the food was fantastic, the drinks outstanding (ordered a mojito), and our waiter was incredible. He was very knowledgeable and offered great input on the menu. Will definately go back!!!
January 18, 2013|A bustling Friday night dinner|4|Though our server had too many tables & seemed a little rushed, he was friendly, efficient & got our order perfectly. We were seated in the back room, which was loud due to two groups of 8; he was taking care of all of us. Specials were good- the sushi rolls were tasty & original. We ordered the cowboy steak... it's a ribeye and though it had good flavor it was very fatty. The homemade sauces (esp the sherry cream) were excellent. The truffle parmasean fries were well worth the calories. Wine list was outstanding, if more $$ than I expected in this market. Overall, it was a great experience & I'd go back on a weekday night the next time Im in town. I have to assume when they are not slammed with large parties the service is impressi
January 18, 2013|Went to 10 for my birthday.|5|Went to 10 for my birthday. The sliced tenderloin was excellent. we asked for a quiet table so they sat us in the back room so we could have a conversation. Service and food was excellent. Highly recommend. Much better than the high end steak chains.
January 18, 2013|We enjoyed the restaurant|4|We enjoyed the restaurant week special. Suchi appetizer delicious (lobster/asparagus) and the ..service was great!!! Overall a very nice time. We were a little pressed for time due to Theater schedule so they prepared our dessert to go which was very good later. Have already recommended the restaurant to others.
January 18, 2013|My favorite place for sushi|5|Best sushi in the area, bar none! Only place I know of where you can go with a group and everyone gets what they want. Great sushi, big juicy steak and mashed potatoes or fish. They do it all and they do it all so well!!!

January 17, 2013|Went during RI Restaurant|5|"Went during RI Restaurant Week and while some restaurants change their portions, 10 served great portions and meal diversity. Food was excellent. Sushi is best in RI, fresh, creative. wait staff (Johnny T. best wait person anywhere and Harrison as manager on top and aware of total restaurant)amazing. Have found 10 always go the ""extra milke"" to make sure eveything is perfect. Brought friends there for the first time and they raved about experience and said they'd be back. Meals were special."
January 16, 2013|Fantastic. Nice atmosphere,|5|Fantastic. Nice atmosphere, sushi was fresh, delicious, and well presented. Filet was cooked as ordered for each of my 6 guests and the sides were scrumptious. Dave, our server, was attentive and witty, keeping us entertained but at the same time keeping his distance where appropriate. I would recommend this for out of town guests, special occasions and any time you want great sushi and great steak.
January 15, 2013|I've been to Ten before and|4|I've been to Ten before and the food is traditionally outstanding. A tiny bit sub par my last visit, but still very enjoyable and contributed to a great experience overall. The service was also some of the best I've had in a while, with a professional but very personable waiter who was genuinely concerned with our experience, food prep time, etc. Great experience, highly recommended.
January 5, 2013|Zero service, Ten food|1|Food and drinks are delicious - amazing actually. It's really too bad the service is so poor. Surprising Ten has no idea how to coordinate their staff and kitchen. After being seated (party of 3), we waiting for 15 minutes and no one came. We finally flagged down the busboy to ask for water and our waiter. When the waiter finally came, he acted irritated and quickly took our order. When 20 minutes past and we still didn't get our drinks, we went directly to the bar to ask for them... the busboy brought them 10 minutes later. Then 2 (out of 3) appetizers came along with 1 of our entrees - at the same time. Food was good, but because of the the horrific service I will never visit this restaurant again and would not recommend it.

December 31, 2012|Oops !|4|Manager was great. Replaced my scotch when the water person removed it from the table too soon. Only problem,when you ask for a $40 steak medium rare,and it comes out medium well,?? I would expect that from a chain restaurant ,but not 10 Prime. And you know what happens when you ask for another, it takes forever and the person you are with is just about done.

December 8, 2012|The restaurant bar area was|4|The restaurant bar area was busy and festive but they made sure that we had a quiet table in another area since it was my romantic birthday celebration. We really enjoyed the quality of the food. I am new to Sushi and the Crunchie Munchie Sushi was a great beginning for me. The steaks we ordered were perfect. They had a great char on the outside and cooked perfectly on the inside.The Brandy Cream sauce was delicious.The waiter was kind enough to get some chop sticks for us that were easy to us....training chop sticks. We will definately return.
December 6, 2012|The service was excellent.|5|The service was excellent. For a relatively slow Thursday night, I expected the food to be better. The sushi was great (Prime Roll and Munchy Crunchy), but the entrees were a solid 4 out of 10. My husband and I ordered the scallop/risotto dish and a filet with 2 sides - the parmesan truffle fries and the brussels sprouts - both of which were inedible..the sprouts were not even close to tender and the fries were very very salty. The steak was absolutely perfectly cooked, however. The day boat scallops were gorgeous but came out luke warm and over cooked - eating a luke warm scallop is like swallowing bazooka gum. Yikes! I would probably go back, the service was amazing and the ambiance was inviting.
November 27, 2012|The service was amazing! The|5|The service was amazing! The food was cooked perfectly! It was my fiancés birthday and I made note if that on the open table reservation. They acknowledge it by providing us with a private booth and came out with a dessert for his birthday! We had a great experience
November 24, 2012|Restaurant wasn't crowded,|4|Restaurant wasn't crowded, but we had to wait for a table? Wasn't a problem because we went to the bar and had no trouble finding a seat and a conversation. Once at our table, the service started out fine, but then we kind of got lost, at least by our waiter. In spite of that, the food was so good, that we could overlook the poor performance by the staff and enjoy the meal. The Southern Cal v. Fighting Irish football game had the boys at the bar getting all crazy too, until Notre Dame took the lead and that quieted things down. As I said, despite the relatively poor service, I will still go back and would recommend the restaurant to friends and family.

We mostly ordered from the appetizer and sushi menu - but , both were very good. The sushi seemed fresh and the menu did offer a couple original rolls which is always great !

Went back after a two year break and it was good...Went a second time and it was back to common...Just not what it used to be in quality. I will not be returning.
October 25, 2012|I went here for a friend's|4|I went here for a friend's birthday and it was a smash hit. We had two specialty sushi rolls recommended by the waitress to start. Both were extremely tasty. My main course was a bacon-wrapped filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection--charred on the outside and pink in the middle. For a side, we shared mashed potatoes. She shared a NY style sirloin with a colleague. For dessert, they shared an apple crisp and I had the banana bread pudding. It was awesome! The waitress was exceptional, attentive and very helpful with her recommendations. Also, the bar scene was really hoping for an early Thursday evening. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.
October 23, 2012|Friends know best|5|A friend recommended 10 Prime to us and we loved it. Best sushi ever. Melt in your mouth steak. Need I say more?
October 20, 2012|We will be back.|4|Atmosphere was cool. Service and food were outstanding. Stylish place.
October 20, 2012|Good but expensive...|4|Ten prime provides good food and good service in an active atmosphere with a decidedly younger vibe. My only lament is that it's a touch over priced. One expects to pay up for a good steak, but across the board the pricing is rich. A couple can easily expect to pay $150 for a night out sans dessert and coffee. That limits our interest in returning frequently...
October 19, 2012|The food was excellent. The|5|The food was excellent. The atmosphere was very nice. Above all, our waiter Johnny, was one of, if not the single best waiter I've ever had in 25 years of dining experience. If the food or atmosphere were any less than what they were, I'd still return just based on Johnny's unparalled attention, service, and personality.
October 12, 2012|I have been to Ten previously|3|I have been to Ten previously because the sushi is very good and the crunchie munchie roll is exquisite and one of my favorites. I used opentable for the first time to make a reservation and it was an easy way to reserve a table. Will definetely use this app and feature again. Although, my friend and I were very displeased with the service upon arriving. We were sitting at our table for about 10-15 when my friend decided to go up to the hostess and complain no one had come over to greet us or even take our drink order. I understand there was some confusion but it wasn't fairly busy or that many tables occupied.Thankfully, the manager Harrison I believe came right over to greet us and apologize for the wait.

LOOKS LIKE A GREAT PLACE FOR SINGLES AFTER WORK ON FRIDAYS. DOUBT WE WILL BE BACK. WAITER WAS NICE GUY AND VERY ATTENTIVE EXCEPT WHEN WE NEEDED HIM, AND THEN WE COULDNT FIND HIM.

August 25, 2012|Slightly disappointed foodie|3|Service was pleasant however tables were very tight and felt as if we were sitting with four other strangers around us with little to no privacy. Lobster menu was smaller than anticipated on the email blast as was the size of the dinner. We were still hungry after we ate our appetizers and our meal. Very disappointed as competitors such as Capriccio's had larger portions at Restaurant week including lobster. Highly recommend larger portions for future references or else it will drive customers elsewhere when expecting a decent sized meal for your buck.

August 24, 2012|This is one of my favorite|5|This is one of my favorite places in Providence. I have eaten here a few times in the past and every time it is a new experience and so delicious. I first brought my daughter here (because she wanted to try sushi) and the wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and recommended various different types of sushi for us to try. They even made us sushi not on their menu. I would highly recommend 10 Prime for anyone who likes sushi, steak, seafood, or a good glass of wine. Very affordable, but I have to warn you that you may not want to order sushi anywhere else.
August 18, 2012|Wonderful!|5|"Excellent service, food was fabulous. Can't wait to go again. Mentioned during reservation it was husband's birthday, they surprised us with a large plate of desserts with ""Happy Birthday"" written in fudge. Wonderful evening."

The food was AWESOME! We both had the clam chowder to start(best i've ever had). For entree's I had sushi and my wife had the filet mignon, both were incredible. The only regret I had was not leaving room to try one of their deserts. I highly recommend Ten Prime.
August 10, 2012|We'll be back! Food and service|5|We'll be back! Food and service was excellent. We had a great table also. Cotton candy as part of dessert - maybe not! It was memorable though :~) The Special (Medallions) was outstanding.
August 4, 2012|Enjoyed the ambiance, but|5|Enjoyed the ambiance, but could hardly hear the other couple we were with because of the noise level. My chicken was ok but my husband's salmon was absolutely delicious. I would probably order the salmon when I go back. The service was top notch.
July 23, 2012|The service was fantastic|4|The service was fantastic but unfortunately the food was delived over cooked, had to be sent back and took forever to rebook which was very surprising since it was a quiet night at the restaurant.
July 21, 2012|Great date night location!|5|"Ten Prime was a find on Open Table, we had not noticed it before because it's tucked just outside of the main downcity area. My husband and I went on a WaterFire night and had the most amazing sushi ""dingy"" (smaller than a full boat), scorpion bowls and dessert. It was our favorite spot for a date night so far! Great atmosphere and fun interior decor."

I've been happy with my experiences at 10 all but this last time. Our app. didn't come for 45 minutes, our waiter was confused and didn't attend to us as we would've liked. The couple next to us was ready to walk out the door because they had been sitting there for 30 minutes without a waiter coming over. The food was very good and the atmosphere nice. The overall experience was disappointing.

July 20, 2012|While I enjoyed Ten Prime|4|While I enjoyed Ten Prime Steak & Sushi, I don't think I would go there when it is not Restaurant Week. The cost of food from their regular menu is very high when I know there are other restaurants just as good in the city that serve at more reasonable prices.
July 19, 2012|Decent, but way overpriced.|2|"Decent, but way overpriced. Even during Restaurant Week. I had heard so many great things about this place and was very disappointed. For being called ""Steak & Sushi,"" there was only one sushi option on the restaurant week menu. The food was good, and the wine list is extensive. But all in all, we probably won't be going back. Other than the prices, everything was fine. But there are just a plethora of far better restaurants in Providence."

The food was amazing; however, Ten Prime Steak & Sushi should reconsider the employment of older waiters as they provide a very unsatisfying dining experience. Because of this, I do not think I would come here again.

June 17, 2012|Overpriced for mediocre food|3|I was very impressed with the first time I ate here. The ambiance is oustanding and the wait staff is amazing and extremely friendly. However, the second and third time I dined here, the food experience was a bit disappointing. The sushi is better than average and the steaks are mediocre. I thought this place was great for seafood since they served sushi and raw fish, but I discovered that was not the case. They can't even prepare the truffle fries correctly as we got a burnt batch the last couple of times. It is overpriced for the quality of food. I probably won't be returning here any time soon.

April 20, 2012|Overprice, incosistant|3|Inconsistent food quality and overpriced. Business casual dress is a joke, fyi. Caesar salad had potential, nice fresh lettuce, crispy croutons and excellent shaved parm, but it had NO dressing; don't know if they just forgot to put it on or just cheaped out? Steaks were good, Death by Butter potatoes (a la carte at $8.99) were just average and the sauces were 50/50; loved the brandy/cream sauce, but thought the Bearnaise lacked flavor. It had a bar atmosphere and only a few private tables, bar patrons hanging over the row of tables in the middle. All in all, not worth the price, go somewhere that can offer consistently good food and a nice atmosphere. We will not return.
April 14, 2012|Ten is a great find in Providence.|4|Ten is a great find in Providence. Although it's a small resturant, the ambiance and atmosphere and great food is like finding a hidden gem in providence. The sushi is the best part for myself, and they are able to make it any way you like it. It can get very busy pretty early so be sure to make a reservation! They have a huge menu of wines/beers and specialty drinks and great unique appetizers and dinners besides sushi. I can't wait to return!

When we arrived, they acknowledged and seated right away, our waiter was excellent and the food, cocktails and wines were outstanding from appetizers to entrees to after dinner drinks. The location is central and close to major hotels. It is a mere ""hole in the wall"" kind of a boutique restaurant and bar/lounge. The atmosphere is lively and energetic and the place was still hopping when we done ans ready to leave. We were all impressed and would definitely go back and strongly recommend it!"

The waiters and waitresses were all very polite and helpful, not to mention professional. The food was spectacular! Best sushi and desserts this place has makes it one of the best restaurants in Providence. The only criticism I would give is the noise level of the music. But other than that, 5 stars.
March 10, 2012|Fabulous Food with Wide Range of Op|5|We were celebrating a special birthday. The service was very good- always enough attention, but never too much. The food was wonderful. this is a great spot when you have members of your party who love fish and have that one guy who has to have a steak! We were surprised at how yummy desserts were - in a place where there were such great entrees ranging from steaks and great sides, and fabulous sushi. The prices were reasonable too. So we will have our boat in PVD this summer, and we will see you again, and again!

My choice of the prime roll (beef carpaccio on top of a lobster-asparagus roll) was not my favorite, but it was something different that I hadn't had a chance to try before. My partner's filet was a little overdone, but still good. The sides were quite good, and the banana bread pudding is amazing. Friendly, efficient service, lively atmosphere. Will go again, but will stick to rolls I know I like.

Calamari appetizer was excellent, tender. Wine list is a bit on the pricey side, the dinner was to celebrate a birthday, so we went for it anyway, but the markup is a bit excessive. Otherwise an all around enjoyable atmosphere and meal.
