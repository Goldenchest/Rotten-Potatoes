February 12, 2016|Twas the night before Valentine's Day...|5|It was the night before Valentine's Day and people just kept piling in. The staff at India never lost their cool or professionalism. Both the owner and manager were kept busy greeting and seating. Our food was scrumptious as always and the service was excellent. I love this place....it's one of our go to restaurants and they never disappoint.

December 26, 2015|solid option|4|Once again a good experience @ India. Not the best service we have enjoyed there, but always great food with pleasant and lively atmosphere. Let alone the wonderful smells. Will return. Hopefully the service will be on par w/ the food.

December 5, 2015|Best yet|5|The food & service was the best yet. Everything was perfect.

October 24, 2015|Mixed results|3|My friend got the spinach saag and liked it very much. I got the shrimp jehlrazi (sp?) and was disappointed to find that not only were the tails still on the shrimp (a common failing in restaurants) but the dish itself, though spicy, had virtually no flavor at all. Nonetheless, I'll give this place a second chance because of the pleasant atmosphere, good service, and convenience to the Gamm Theatre, and try the chicken tikka masala, my usual test dish.
September 26, 2015|It was a super busy night- and they did GREAT|5|It was a super busy night at India- the first chilly Saturday evening of the fall season. We made a last minute reservation using OT. They got us in, service was great and the food was wonderful as always. This is a great place to go- and they prove it to you every time you visit. We love all of the new menu items.

September 8, 2015|Wonderful dining experience|5|This restaurant has ambiance and charm in spades, the service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious. Even the presentation of the food is a treat. I can't wait to go back and sit on the front patio or inside by one of the fire places.

August 29, 2015|SIMPLY - ALWAYS A GOOD MWAL|5|India is a gem in the haystack. The owner really takes pride in his restaurant and its meals. His menu is different from other India like restaurants - but more unique and authentic. The weekend is great when entertaining guests from out of town since they have cultural dancers and henna tattoo for the quests - though, a classy setting. This is a great place to introduce Indian food and culture to children. The outdoor dining has swings to make it memorable for a first date - or date night for the married couples. The food is very tasty and a good reason to explore other items on the menu. My advice is to just go this awesome restaurant.
August 28, 2015|The best restaurant I have been to thus far.|5|Customer service was great. Food was amazing. Drinks were excellent. Ambiance was great. Everything about this place is amazing, I recommend this place to everyone.
July 19, 2015|Always good food and service.|5|Always good food and service.
June 30, 2015|India Restaurant offers everything|5|Ambience makes for a perfect dining experience and the India Restaurant has it inside and outside. It doesn't get better to be surrounded by an array of frest growing flowers when dining outside or to have interesting decor on the inside with a fireplace to boot. The music isn't too loud which so many other restaurants. The view to the park across the street is inviting, always a plus when dining outside. Naan bread is always a great appetizer, here at The India Restaurant they offer a variety basket rather than charging you $3.50 for each variety, although I think they should include the coconut/honey in the variety basket. The martini selection is interesting and flavorful although mine wasn't as strong as other restaurants. Husband ordered lamb shops medium rare which to him meant pinkish on the inside, his were well done yet still tender and flavorful which was a good thing. Their Tea selection is over the top, I highly recommend trying a cup, same goes for their chocolate molten cake with pistachio ice cream on top. One serving was enough for 4 people. Hint to all restaurant s: If you want a satisfied customer to come back be flexible to alter an entree. That's what The India Restaurant is willing to do. For example I ordered a vegetarian entre but I wanted shrimp added, also, I wanted a salad instead instead of what was offered, there was no problem. At The India Restaurant their priority is to please the customer which is after all the main reason why I go out to dine. There are many Indian Restaurants to chose from but rarely do you see as many discount specials as offered here. Other restaurants should take note of this because great food at great prices makes for a satisfied customer who will spread the word. Our Server was very pleasant and accomodating. She was prompt and the food was hot. One last thing I would like to add to my review is in the past when I have eaten at Indian Restaurants the portions are plentiful.
June 26, 2015|India is fantastic|5|Every time we come here we are delighted with the amazing food and friendly staff. The prices are crazy-affordable. One of our favorite places in providence!
June 19, 2015|Not what it used to be|3|Food that was not labeled spicy was too spicy... Husbands food was missing swordfish in his plate and they brought two tiny pieces to the table. No discount no anything. Not the greatest response to an issue. People on other tables where having issues with spice too and their items where taken off the bill. Giant margaritas and bread where great.
June 9, 2015|Half Price Entrees on Tuesdays|5|The India delivers with attentive and cheerful service from the moment you step inside. The decor is comfortably exotic with curtains hanging from the ceiling between booth seating. The outdoor patio overlooks the park and is good for people watching. The menu includes a good variety of Indian standards. The food was delicious and delivered piping hot. They have a full liquor license.
June 9, 2015|Spinach salad|5|The restaurant used to offer a spinach salad as an alternative to kale salad. Need to bring back the spinach!! Overall a delightful meal!
June 6, 2015|Great Time|5|Simply outstanding food from start to finish with service from our waitperson second to none. Once again, this is the go to restaurant for the best special dining experience. I'll not be able to eat lamb anywhere else that comes this close to perfection. We had not been to The India Restaurant in some time and is clearly our loss . We won't wait that long before our next visit!
May 29, 2015|Menu seems different?|4|The hostess was the best. She was so hospitable and friendly. Our server lacked a bit of personality but he was polite and nice. We have been coming here for a few years, this time the food was good but not great. We noticed some dishes tasted different (perhaps a menu change)? The naan was a disappointment but the overall evening was great.
May 20, 2015|Beats going to Bollywood|5|Save yourself the airfare and travel to India by car instead. One step inside and you'll feel like you've been transported to an overseas epicurean adventure. Naan and chicken masala were amazing!
May 16, 2015|Great Food very Lively|4|"My wife and I went around 9:00 on a Friday. I would not advise this if you plan on having a conversation. Music was lound and also some people. The belly dancer was fun but also a relief when the music stopped and we could talk again. To be fair I don't know if it was excessively loud because of the large group celebrating a birthday On to the important part, the food. Somosas are pan fried which is a change from what I am used to and they are delicious. Love the tamarind dipping sauce with them. I ordered the vindaloo which tasted awesome but had to send back to spice it up. I was suprised it's vindaloo how can it not be hot. I gave it back and said ""whatever you did here double it"" and it was still modereately spicy but the flavor was fantastic. Probably one of the best vindaloos I had purely in terms of flavor and to be honest I am a leather mouth and have a high heat tolerance. I would certainly order it again. My wife had the vegetable mango curry. It was a red curry whic is different from the yellow she is used to but different is not a bad thing. She enjoyed it but stated it could use more cashews. Overall I would say I would go on a weeknight or during the day for lunch. I guess I am too old for the Friday night scene. (not really) and again the food is fantastic overall. Considering how busy they were the service was acceptable. We will go back and enjoy the outdoor seating real soon."
May 7, 2015|India|5|Been here many times and it's always good. Nice atmosphere, Very friendly service, great food at a good price. What more could you want?
May 1, 2015|Great atmosphere and delicious food!!|5|I really love this place I have taken a few different friends here for there first Indian food experience and they do not dissapoint. Love the Friday night belly dancer entertainment. Drink service is a little slow but besides that I have no other complaints and will definitely be back soon.
April 19, 2015|Great family meal|5|Delicious food, drink and service, as always. Brought my son for first time, he loved it! My daughter's second time, she loved it as well. We had appetizers (including Naan bread), curry dishes and my favorite, Lamb Biryani. Mango coladas and mango lassi!
March 28, 2015|Very Good|4|Good place. Very fun. Belly dancer was great. Food very good, but a little on the mild side. Next time I would make sure to tell them to make it spicier.
March 21, 2015|Great Indian, Great Price|5|It had been a while since we had indian food and this was really good. We went early and it was quiet. They offered me a wifi password to help get a uber cab.
March 10, 2015|GREAT FOOD|5|Their lamb chop kebabs are just wonderful. That item along with the mussels appetizer are excellent choices at India. Check it out...
March 6, 2015|Excellent Indian restaurant|4|Have been here several times and it never disappoints. Very good Indian cuisine and reasonably priced. Service is great. Had the chicken vindaloo (as usual) and top notch. If one really prefers a spicy vindaloo it must be specified which is actually a good thing for those that do not prefer default heat. The mango ice cream is outstanding!
February 28, 2015|Delicious Indian Food|5|Excellent food, great service very personable staff.
February 14, 2015|Wonderful spot for a romantic evening|5|The place is beautiful, the food amazing, and the service was very friendly. It's a great spot for a date. They have a fire place it's not to loud the lighting is dim so it's not overly bright they have a henna girl that will give u a free henna tattoo they have belly dancers it's a great place. It's my new favorite place
February 14, 2015|Perfect Valentine's Day Spot|4|Although there was a snow storm outside, we braved the weather to make our 6 o'clock reservation at India for Valentine's Day. They seated us in the corner room with the wood-burning stove and it was perfectly romantic. I was disappointed that we couldn't stay to watch the belly dancing, but we'll check that out next time. The food and service were both very good. We'll definitely be back!
February 14, 2015|Nice dinner|4|Food was excellent as per usual. I like that they modify the traditional Indian dishes to make them healthier such as not using butter, etc. The service is always great, helpful, and accommodating. The prices are also very affordable for the food you are getting. Will be back.
February 10, 2015|Never disappointing|5|Went to India again the other night and the meal was awesome. The atmosphere is always very pleasant andthe restaurant is attractive. I have been many times and have never been disappointed. It will continue to be a place i will always go when I want to treat myself or a member of my family.

Dined on February 6, 2015|Name Says It All|5|The name of the restaurant, Indian, says it all. This was the most delicious Indian food we've ever eaten - hands down.
February 6, 2015|Fabulous Experience!|5|Everything about India restaurant was terrific! We started with the variety bread basket (which was huge) enjoyed the Vindaloo chicken/shrimp as the main course which was nice and spicy and finished with the lemoncello cake which was soooooo moist and yummy. Add a few glasses of wine and a delightful server and we had an excellent evening out!!! looking fowrard to returning!
February 1, 2015|Wonderful service, food and ambiance.|5|We went to the India Restaurant for the first time only last week. We actually returned 3 days later, it was that good.Good choice for service, food and general ambiance. The management and staff are welcoming and efficient.
January 29, 2015|Great food and friendly staff|5|I've come here repeatedly because the food is fantastic and the staff are all very nice and friendly. They recognize me as I come in and they try to put us at our regular table if it's available.
January 28, 2015|Wonderful ambiance....sat right in front...|5|Wonderful ambiance....sat right in front of one of the multiple fire places this time and was nice and toasty. Food here is NEVER a disappointment. On most occasions, I cannot finish my dish and take home leftovers that, although are wonderfully flavorful at the restaurant, are even better reheated the following day!
January 24, 2015|Saag peneer is to die for!!!|5|Took my wife here for her birthday and she loved it . From the belly dancer to the amazing dishes and the cheese cake they made her as a little birthday cake they hit this big out of the park !!!!!
January 13, 2015|Great Lamb|4|My fiancé and I love lamb, and cannot resist their lamb chops. Coming from a different culture ourselves, we look forward to eating Indian food at the restaurant. Their salad is delicious, and their sides are always fresh. Smiling waiters and happy hostesses complete our experience and always make our trek to this part of town enjoyable.
December 31, 2014|Great Food|5|We have been going to India for many years and have never been disappointed. Food is always consistent and fresh. There are plenty of items on the menu for non curry lovers. They will gladly adjust the spice level of their dishes if you like. Service is excellent and prices are reasonable.
December 31, 2014|New Years Eve Brunch,|4|Great menu, lots of choices. We liked the buffet choices! Some of buffet items could've used pre-heating before placed for consumption. Otherwise, it was all tasty & appropriate. Service was very good, and waiter was well-mannered. Recommend this place for families, or couples.
December 1, 2014|A nice change of pace.|4|India provides a broad assortment of Indian specialties. The food is consistently good, and the service is always friendly. While not haute cuisine, one can rely on experiencing varied tastes and textures that invariably delight. Not everything tastes of curry which allows a broad expression of Indian cuisines. Vegetarians have lots of options, and personal, I have always enjoyed the swimming pool sized basic margarita. Our grand kids love the mango lassis. Prices are very reasonable, and there are many frequent dining discounts.
November 22, 2014|First time|5|It was a great experience. The staff was outstanding. It was quiet. We were seated near the fireplace which was really homey. I enjoyed the food and the drinks! The decor of the restaurant was awesome! I will definitely visit again soon!
November 21, 2014|I liked India Restaurent. However, this ...|4|I liked India Restaurent. However, this was the second time, the waiter(each time a different one) pointed out that we finished our plates. While I think it might have been meant as a friendly comment, I found this slightly rude. It really makes me consider going back there.
November 8, 2014|Charming Place To Dine|5|The service was excellent and our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and explained the ingredients and taste we could expect from the various dishes. There was entertainment in the restaurant. There was a dancer performing ethnic dances to indian music. The food was excellent. My dinner choice was the duck. I highly recommend it. Dessert was also great. I enjoy a nice strong cup of black coffee and they had coffee that totally satisfied my taste. I normally will not eat kale in any form but the kale salad at India has made me a convert. Being a Saturday night the restaurant was very crowded yet we never felt neglected or had to wait for service. They certainly have their act together and I am looking forward to a return visit there.
October 25, 2014|First visit of what is will be many|5|We had a fabulous time, the food was great as well as the service. Highly recommend.
October 18, 2014|awesome experience|4|Good dinning, exotic ambiance. Nice waitress and nice belly dancer, overall a plesant night
October 11, 2014|India at its best|5|This was our first visit, although our daughter had eaten here before. I can say with certainty that we will be back.
September 27, 2014|Great Indian Food|5|Consistently great food; Kabobs, Vindaloo, Lamb Appetizers and varieties of Nan make for an excellent dining experience. Two different outdoors settings. In front so you are part of the restaurant and can people watch and in back where it's very peaceful. Belly dancer provides entertainment. Service can be a little spotty depending on server and number of diners.
September 26, 2014|added spice to my life!|5|It was like I traveled to India! Belly dancing, Henna tattoos (done for free, you pick your own design!) and spicy food. We got to sit outside and there were swings instead of static chairs - definitely added uniqueness.
September 7, 2014|A perfect afternoon feast|4|My friends and I so enjoyed the lovely atmosphere, helpful and attentive service, and the delicious buffet that allowed us to taste foods we might not have otherwise tried. We'll make India a regular gathering spot.
September 2, 2014|Great place|5|We went on a tuesday, so we go 50% off entrees! The food here is delicious, I got the charbroiled chicken with sweet potatoes. The ambiance is also great, inside and outside, it's very romantic. Will definitely be back again.
September 1, 2014|We were blown away by the quality..|5|My wife & I have been to many Indian restaurants, but were caught off guard at how good the food was at this one was. From the excellent customer service to the owner stopping by to see how we liked it. It has atmosphere, high food quality and fantastic customer service. I could not say enough good things...
August 23, 2014|We ate here aug.23 for my daughters birt...|4|We ate here aug.23 for my daughters birthday. The food was all very interesting and flavourful, and you can request the level of spiciness for anything you order. Our server was great. Our girls were very entertained by the Bollywood movie playing on the big screen.
August 19, 2014|Great food and wonderful service. Will d...|5|Great food and wonderful service. Will definitely visit again!
August 16, 2014|Deliciously Good|5|We've dined here before--but took my parents for the first time on Saturday night. It was their first experience eating Indian food--and even my dad who is notoriously unadventurous with food, completely enjoyed! My mom who is very carb conscious loved that she could replace the rice with the Kale and Cucumber salad with her curry. My dad and I enjoyed the Biranyani (and I'm pretty sure I just spelled that wrong), while my husband enjoyed the lamb kabobs--we even ordered off the Doggie menu for a little treat for our furry friend who was at home! I think he enjoyed his chicken and rice too! Really a treat for the entire family!
August 13, 2014|Very Nice Experience|4|Although a little on the louder side, volume was very typical of an after work crowd in an upscale eatery. My waitress was superb, and I didn't notice anyone perturbed about bad service. I love Indian cuisine, and this place didn't disappoint with their curry dish. I would definitely recommend it, and will go back if I ever get back to Providence.
August 2, 2014|Good Food|5|Good food and if you can go on a weekend night you'll get to see the belly dancer. It was a good time had by all.
July 27, 2014|Birthday Dinner|5|"We had a most wonderful dinner at your restaurant celebrating my daughter's 16th birthday with 2 of her girlfriends and their mothers...a ""Girl's night out"". The food was delicious and the server (a lovely woman with a ?Spanish accent) was exceptional! We were so full we did not order dessert but were served a complimentary mango banana split with candles.....and a Happy Birthday Chorus sang to the Birthday Girl! We did manage to polish off the dessert!! We took a peak out in the patio in back and we are sure to try that next time....it was so beautiful with swing seats and beautiful flowers everywhere. Thank you so much for a fun evening out!!!! We will surely be back.....with the boys the next time!!"
July 26, 2014|Outstanding|5|Celebrated my birthday with my family. It was all around an amazing evening. We sat in the garden with half the table being a booth and the other having swings for seats. The food was spectacular, seasoned really well. We got Henna tattoos from a lovely young lady, we missed the belly dancer but will be back to catch the show (only during weekend for both) Dessert was scrumptious, definitely coming back. Thanks for the amazing attentive service and for being so warm and welcoming.
July 22, 2014|Good food, slow service|3|The food here is consistently tasty and interesting. Unfortunately, the service is hit or miss. During the last visit, it took five or more minutes before wait staff even greeted us, let alone bring water or other drinks. Best to go for the buffet, where one is not so dependent on prompt service.
July 19, 2014|Entertaining|4|I booked for the place with my fiancé, we arrived early and ended up needing the reservation which was nice. The manager or owner urged us to sit outside in their courtyard -- it was beautiful! You are seated either in a regular chair or a swing chair, there are many beautiful flowers around and a relaxing fountain, I would recommend sitting there on a beautiful afternoon/evening. We left earlier than we wanted only due to impending rain, but just as we left the belly dancer was coming to perform! There is also free henna painting inside. We did not order any drinks, but they seemed to have a good selection. The food came in very large portions, but for me the atmosphere stole the show.
July 15, 2014|Great, as always|5|We've been dining at India for a number of years now and never are disappointed. This latest time was superb, as always. The staff were attentive and efficient, the food marvelous, and the pricing extremely fair. We recommend India highly to all of our friends and acquaintances. A special surprise this time was a discount applied to all entrees on Tuesday through Thursday nights!
July 15, 2014|Great first experience|5|This was our first time dining at India. I had very little experience with Indian food. The ambience was great with beautiful outdoor seating. The waitress couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. She helped us with our order and her recommendations were perfect! I started with a Pear martini that was very good. appetizers were samosas and a basket of naan breads( all varieties). My favorite were the ginger & honey and pesto. I chose the chicken masala entrée and my husband ordered the kebob platter. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be returning.
July 12, 2014|great food and atmosphere|5|Consider the restaurant a dining adventure, lived up to my expectations. Had never had Indian food so it was a very delightful experience. Make sure to request patio seating in the rear of the restaurant, a very beautiful location.
July 11, 2014|no|1|Not a good experience 2 nd time around the cook must have been different the first time out steak was tender and marinated lots of flavor this time tont hard cubes of steak overcooked and only 2 tiny cubes
July 1, 2014|Not as good as usual...|3|We came for the soccer special. Our original waiter kept mumbling so much we had to have him keep repeting himself. He eventually just abandoned us and other waitstaff in the restaurant just helped our table when we needed something.
June 29, 2014|Indian Restaurant Found|4|We have been looking for an excellent Indian restaurant and now have found it in India.
June 28, 2014|Great Little Spot|5|My wife and I loved the outdoor patio garden area. Tables were under trellises, and the seats on one side of the tables were swings. The food was excellent! The jumbo margaritas (20 oz) were too big. Next time we'll order one and share it. We love Indian food, and have been to many Indian restaurants. This is the best ever!
May 17, 2014|Great dinner|5|Food and service were fantastic. Cosmo was a little weird but I don't blame the restaurant for that; wine was good.
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day Brunch Buffet|5|Went in for a late-ish lunch on Mother's Day. Outside seating was very popular. We sat inside but right near the doors to the patio, which made for a pleasant atmosphere. The buffet food was excellent, as were the frozen drinks (I had the mudslide myself). Drink service was a little slow as they were busy, but overall the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was great. Definitely recommend.
May 11, 2014|We had a great meal on Mother's Day. My ...|5|We had a great meal on Mother's Day. My wife grew up in England and she loves Indian food. Over there you find Indian restaurants everywhere. she grew up in a small village in northern England and there's an Indian restaurant right in the village center right next to the pub. I wanted to do something special for her on Mother's Day and this fit the bill.
Dined on May 11, 2014|Top notch|5|Good variety - always amazing service - great outdoor spot
May 9, 2014|Best Indian |4|So delicious. The naan is perfect, the currie dishes are my favorite. Apps are good. But I may be frequenting this place over the summer just for The mango colada!
April 29, 2014|Great food|4|I have been to India several times for dinner and my favorite dishes are: The spicy Biryani, the Sirloin Kebob and the Lamb Chops. All of them are outstanding. The meats, I order medium rare and the juiciness and tenderness of the meat is just crazy good. The Kale salad that comes with the kebob entrees is fresh, light and delicious. The Basmati rice is a great side to the kebobs. The service is nice and polite. Attentive and non intrusive. The decor is very soft and cozy with some Bollywood movies in the main dining area.
April 25, 2014|Never Disappointed|4|Have been on several occasion had family in from Texas and we brought them to India for their first time... they loved it - authentic- great menu choices- food delicious- - service was great- prices reasonable.....
April 20, 2014|Good authentic taste of the subcontinent cuisine..|4|Pretty good food, Good ambiance, an unassuming exterior leads to a good interior. Check out the outdoor dining area as well
April 20, 2014|Not bad|4|"Pleasant dining, comfortable seating. The service is attentive and friendly. The food is tasty but a couple items were overcooked when we went last time to the Sunday buffet. Time before they had a seafood special that was perfect. This is a tasty change of pace place for us we go to periodically. Try the alcoholic ""Tea"" , very good but practice restraint. They will sneak up on you. Wife likes the Mamosa's."
April 15, 2014|First Time Visit|4|Wife and I visited India on a Tuesday night. Service was a bit slow but waitress seemed to be waiting on many tables. Waitress was very friendly and overall atmosphere was very relaxing. Red Sangria was excellent as was Aloo Tikki and Lentil Spinach soup. Naan Pizza ad Aloo Gobhi were good but we'd probably try other dishes on the next visit.
April 8, 2014|Great food|4|I had the sirloin kebob and it was tender, moist and flavorful. Service was attentive and prompt.
April 6, 2014|Ok|3|The food was great, but the service was lackluster. Maybe its because I went there mid day and not during a night rush? Idk... our waiter was kind of a space cadet.
April 6, 2014|great restaurant|5|healthy food - tasty - we go there all the time - the favorite place to eat with my teenagers
March 14, 2014|Service and food were excellent,|5|Service and food were excellent, as always. It was a very busy night for the staff but they handled the flow well. We highly recommend this restaurant to all of our friends.
March 8, 2014|Amazing Indian Flavors in Providenc|4|My husband & I decided to look for a new Indian restaurant. We had heard about India, but had never tried it. Our experience was fabulous. The flavors were excellent, selections abundant. Our server was very good; he remembered our orders without writing them down...he was very attentive....our drinks came within 5 minutes of ordering and our appetizer arrived within 10 minutes in spite of the restaurant being busy. We arrived at 5 pm for dinner. By the time we left at 6 pm, many of the tables were already filled. We'll be back.
March 7, 2014|Consistent|5|Food and service is consistent. Service is genuine, with smile and food is delicious. Sangria is a little weak, that is my only constructive feedback.
March 5, 2014|Consistently good food|5|I tend to get the same thing and I've been to almost every Indian restaurant in Providence so far. The food here is consistently good and the flavors can't be beat. The chicken biryani is the best I've had in Providence.
February 28, 2014|Great for big group|4|We had a big group of old friends so we can get a little loud. This is a great place because we don't feel like we are interrupting other diners. It's energetic, we loved the belly dancer. The food was very good and the cocktails were delicious.
February 26, 2014|Great lamb chops!|5|In this attractive neighborhood restaurant we ordered the chef 's specials and had an excellent meal. The lamb chops were particularly outstanding.
February 25, 2014|Great food, great location|4|Located on Hope St in Providence, near Blackstone Blvd, this restaurant offers many great specials....like 50% off entrees on Tuesdays. Great food, great value.
February 14, 2014|didn't know what to expect|4|I wasn't sure if I'd like the cuisine but I ended up loving everything. The kabobs were excellent and the drinks were very good also, would highly recommend it.
February 14, 2014|Love India|5|The food is very consistently excellent, the waitstaff are attentive and professional, and the atmosphere is really nice. There was a gas fireplace by our table. Always cozy. Weekend belly dancing is cool.
February 14, 2014|We love this restaurant. It|5|We love this restaurant. It has delicious food thati beaufully presented. Staff is welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of atmosphere and charm. It is in my neighborhood bt aay feels like a special place. We loved the special crab and shrimp korma and chicken saag. The indian breads are a perfect compliment. Wonderful restaurant to celebrate Valentines day.
February 11, 2014|consistent|5|From the greeting and seating to app through dessert, consistency is a given. The food is excellent (especially the kale salad) and the signature cocktails pair with the food very well. I always recommend India and visit twice per month.
February 11, 2014|still the one|5|I have tried other restaurants but i always come back to India. The food is always fresh and tasty. Most of the dishes are healthy . And the atmosphere is awesome, this restaurant is beautiful. The servers are friendly and attentive. They also have a good drink menu with lots of variety.I would suggest this restaurant for special occasions or if you just want a different dining experience.
February 8, 2014|Great Atmosphere|4|This was my first time and I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was nice, the food was good and I got my first henna tattoo.
February 7, 2014|Our Favorite Dining Place|5|My husband and I absolutely LOVE the staff! They are always happy, have a great sense of humor and aim to please their guests! Plus, the wait staff have been there for a long time. You always see a friendly face and they remember you too. :) The menu offers a wide variety of food to please anyone's palate. It's not all spicey and hot. I love the Byriani with chicken! The food is superior! The cocktails are so good too! We enjoy bringing friends and family to this restaurant. The ambiance is excellent no matter where you sit. Inside or out you will love being here. The belly dancer is awesome and getting henna tattoos is really fun!
January 28, 2014|I highly recommend India Restaurant|4|"India Restaurant is among several ethnic restaurants in Providence that are true gems. Lovely ambiance, good food, wine and service at reasonable prices. I had not been in years and cannot yet comment on lunches, wine list, etc. I am pleased to have returned. It is great to have many vegan/vegetarian options. As their notable phrase indicates, India Restaurant will ""spice up your life!"""

December 31, 2013|Delightfully Good|5|We found this restaurant while looking for a last minute News Years Eve option - and could not be happier! We arrived at 7pm, which was just before things got really busy. The menu was delightfully different, with Indian standards and unique items. Started with the Indian Nachos which were really tasty. Husband had the Lobster and Shrimp in Coconut Curry and I had the Duck in Tamarind Curry. Both were wonderful. Duck was perfectly cooked . Curry has beautiful heat. And I cannot say enough about the kale salad. Nirvana cocktail was addicting. Belly dancer was charming. It did get very busy, so out of respect for the other diners we did not linger. However, we will be back!
December 31, 2013|Repeat customer|4|"We have been to India Restaurant often. It is relatively small, but wonderful, quiet ambiance. It is kid sound turned off. There was a beautiful Indian movie the night we were there and we chose to pay attention. Otherwise it is not noticeable. Children are welcome and I have never experienced restless or impolite children. I am not sure of they have a ""kid's menu"". Now the important part......the food is awesome. The chef/s is very willing to adapt any dish to accommodate special dietary needs as possible. I have had multiple dishes and have enjoyed them all. My husband is a lamb saag person! India Restaurant is definitely worth a try."
December 24, 2013|A favorite spot|5|Love India. Have been there many times and the food is good and the service excellent.
December 24, 2013|Christmas Eve|4|Made reservations for Christmas Eve for 6. Great Food and lovely seating with a fireplace in the table area. Hot spiced apple cider was so good! Great vegan entrees. Everyone loved their food. Low carb entrees as well.
December 21, 2013|Fun!!!|5|Went w/ my girlfriends last Saturday night and we had a blast! Great food, entertainment and love my free henna tattoo!
December 17, 2013|Favorite restaurant in Providence|5|India is a wonderful restaurant. The Peppered Duck in Tamarind Curry has become my all time's favorite. My husband loves their lentil soup and garlic naan. We tried the Swordfish Kabob for the first time recently, and it was absolutely delicious! Our favorite spot in the restaurant is by the fireplace next to the French doors, but in the summer, the outdoor seats are converted to swings! How fun! This is a must go restaurant, highly recommended!
December 1, 2013|Definitely go on the weekend|4|Definitely go on the weekend for brunch. Tons of choices and something for everybody.
November 30, 2013|Best of India!|5|Lovely ambiance, great food and friendly staff! The naan was solo good and the duck and lamb dishes were unique and tasty!
November 23, 2013|Love it!!|5|I always have a excellent experience when I visit India restaurant on Hope Street in Providence. The staff is very friendly and remember you! The food is delicious! Henna is the best and the entertainment is great!
November 17, 2013|Best restaurant around New England.|5|Relaxed atmosphere, thedecoration takes an award as well as lighting, Denisse the host makes you feel at home. From the moment you walk in you get transported to the cultural riches of east, from delightful music to delicious dishes, knowledgeable staff that knows the food's in and outs and what to suggest based on the client's preference. The menu is magnificient with many delicious choices, from grilled meats to curries (spiced stews but they can make it less spicy or more spicy if you'd like) The duck in tamarind curry is a home run, and so is the kale/cucumber salad. I was treated like the most important person in the planet, I was fed like a king in a beautiful environment while listening to great middle eastern and indian music.
November 15, 2013|Great food|5|Around 45 dollars per person (including 1 drink and tip)
November 9, 2013|India - on a whim|4|It seemed my girlfriend and I ran out of ideas, so we decided on India. She'd been a few years back and I'm glad she came up with this idea. Our 8:00 reservation had us seated by 8:15; the waiter was very knowledgeable; (thankfully - I've NEVER had Indian food) and the food came out quick, hot and delicious. The belly dancer was an added feature that we both found entertaining. I'm looking forward to going back.
November 5, 2013|Get the seafood offerings|3|Get the seafood offerings as they are really special but what suffers here is the classical India cuisine as its just not up to par when it comes to seasonings. For example, India serves the worst and chewiest naan bread I ever had which is completely inedible when it gets cold. Conversely, the ambience is better than most Indian restaurants as it leans to the upscale.
Dined on November 5, 2013|Delicious|5|Great meal at a great price. Service was excellent and the food was all so good.
November 2, 2013|Wonderful and unique Indian food|5|This is a beautiful restaurant--great decor and laid out in a way that almost every table feels private. I had a truly wonderful dish for dinner--duck with tamarind, hazelnuts, and figs--SO good!!! And they serve slice and roasted sweet potatoes as a lower-carb alternative to rice--so good for carb-counters. (You can get rice if you wish.) A kale and cucumber salad that comes with the dinner is excellent--and I rarely like kale.
October 18, 2013|Always perfect!|5|My husband and I enjoyed another delicious dinner at the India in Providence. The mussels are the best I've ever had. The service is exceptional!
October 13, 2013|Always excellent|5|I've never had a bad meal at India and the service is always excellent. My favorite dish is the lamb biryani, but I also enjoy the many curries. And naan bread! The margaritas are tasty and very large! The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly. We were running a little late, but they held our reservation for a much desired table by the fireplace! Another great dining experience.
October 9, 2013|Dont dumb it down|3|"Ambience was great, service was great. the food wasn't. good in some parts, but they need to add some authenticity to call it ""Indian"" food and not modify it to other taste. my pet peeve is indian food is not just about the food being spicy or hot. Its about flavor. most ""indian"" restaurants in countries outside india ""dumb it down"" and this, in my view kills the flavor and not the spiciness and most of the stuff has a sweet twang to it, while it shouldn't."
October 5, 2013|Another amazing dinner|5|Probably one of my favorite restaurants. The staff is always friendly and attentive, the ambiance is outstanding and the food is ALWAYS delicious. We were saying that Saturday evening, as often as we go to India for dinner, the food is always consistently prepared. It's also always quiet inside, even when all the tables are full...the only problem I have is that the outback garden is closed until next spring, I will miss sitting out there in the greenery.
September 28, 2013|Great!!!|5|This was our first time at India and fist time trying Indian food!! It was delicious and entertaining. It was great and will go back!
September 27, 2013|Besides the smell it was good|4|It was great food, but our waiter needed to learn how to use deodorant.... The cocktails were weak, so i wouldn't recommend them! But the food is well priced as well as very tasty.
September 26, 2013|dining with friends|5|I bought my friends that were new to India, and they Loved it, the food the pleasant friendly service the whole experence . and they will want to come back.
September 24, 2013|Always friendly|3|Nice to bring friends that have not been before, I have been many times and in joy every one , bringing friends tonight.
September 23, 2013|Good food and excellent wait staff|4|Three of us met for a birthday celebration and enjoyed the variety of dishes, the service, and the overall ambiance.
September 21, 2013|Exceptional|5|We took our family out to dinner to celebrate a birthday. Our son (24) liked the reviews for India Restaurant so this was our first time there. We absolutely loved it. The food was particularly good and the spicy was very spicy. The presentation of food was lovely. The atmosphere and decor were wonderful - very conducive to a good meal. The staff was super congenial. What a great experience!
September 13, 2013|Great ambiance and food|5|Outdoor dining is a great option for cool summer nights; the patio in the front is idyllic. The service is attentive, and the food is delicious. The garlic naan was amazing.
September 5, 2013|Excellent|4|On our first visit we were greeted by a fantastic host that asked us where we would prefer to sit since it was our first time. From that point forward, the service remained excellent, with recommendations from the waitstaff about apps, bread baskets and finally the main course. The ambiance was quiet and was unique. We went on a Thursday evening so I am not sure how busy it gets on weekends, but we had a relatively quiet evening. The location is quaint so plan ahead with reservations or you may have a wait.
August 24, 2013|Always good|4|This is a great spot with great flavors. The swinging seats in theback outdoor patio are not for everyone.
August 23, 2013|Best lamb in town|5|I love India, but I admit I haven't sampled their menu widely, as I discovered their lamb kebobs, and now that is my favorite thing to order. I like to eat a lot of veggies, and theirs are terrific: kale-cucumber salad, grilled broccoli and veggie curries are all good.
August 23, 2013|Beautiful environment|5|I enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance. I would suggest you try it out.
August 10, 2013|Great surprise|4|Our daughter just moved near by so we went to eat there, it looked beautiful in side and loved the back out side seating, the food was very good and large portions. There Tuesday night bar special are amazing.
August 3, 2013|Just okay|2|Food was okay. We had a party of six; our server never placed the order for one of our guests. He didn't get his meal until we all finished ours. Without a doubt, the mixed drinks and sangrias do not have appropriate ratios of alcohol to other ingredients. Watered down, without question. Sitting outside was nice. Will not return.
July 23, 2013|Good food, 50% entrees on Tuesdays|3|Went there for 50% entrees on Tuesdays. Great deal. I had the Seafood Mango and it was a great mix of shrimp, mussells and swordfish. Nice and spicy !!
July 19, 2013|Going back!|4|My girlfriend and I had a fantastic experience at India! We orderered a few cocktails that we're quite tasty and ordered two apps while splitting an entree. Food was superb:). Fafa and I will be going back with friends for sure!!
July 18, 2013|Need to get better a/c|3|I ate here a couple of years ago and said I'd never come back because they don't have air conditioning. I reluctantly agreed to go back, only to find that a/c is still a problem. I sat at my table and sweated the entire time. Luckily, the server kept coming by with ice water.
June 30, 2013|Love the Brunch!|5|We love to take our family to India. Celebrating family birthdays and special events over brunch is our favorite. Friday night entertainment of belly dancer and a henna artist was fun also,The fun is really good.
June 21, 2013|What a treat|4|The food was simply excellent. Service was very pleasant. I took some out of town guests who suggested India food as one of their favorites and were very impressed with the quality.
June 16, 2013|Brunch on Father's Day|4|Everything was very nice. (as usual, we've been there, and in Warren when it was open a number of times.
June 13, 2013|India Restaurant is the gem of Prov|5|My wife and I have been going to India Restaurant for several years. They had another location in Warren, RI a few years back and that's where we met. We have since been going to India for our anniversaries, special occasions and sometime just for their brunch. The food is aromatic and exceptionally prepared. The tastes are a treat for the senses. The prices are well placed and not too expensive for just about any budget. The service is always fantastic. The ambiance, superb with live jazz or traditional Indian sitar music on occasion. Belly dancers and henna tattoos are also available on certain days. I heartily recommend trying India. You'll be hooked!
June 11, 2013|Great find for us vegans/vegetarian|5|Great selection, happy to find a vegan/vegetarian menu mostly. Great atmosphere, great waiter! Delicious all around!! Love the drinks/tv!
May 30, 2013|great time|4|Met with some friends in back room Service and food were great. Fun time for all. I reserve 5 stars for best places on earth so only gave. 4 here but had a great time.
May 30, 2013|As always, delicious food|5|As always, delicious food and attentive staff. As a bonus the back terrace was open and beautifully planted!
May 27, 2013|Great Dinner Choice|4|Food was excellent. Menu offers a varied selection of traditional Indian dishes. The Vindaloo is a must! I'd recommend the lamb as it was cooked perfectly and was flavorful. Service was attentive without being overbearing. Outdoor seating, especially in the rear of the restaurant, is a nice touch to complete the dining experience. Traditional Indian dancers perform on the weekend for quests. Overall great dining experience.
May 25, 2013|Great night out!|5|My wife and I won a gift certificate to this restaurant and decided to go this past weekend. We love Indian food and we were not disappointed. The drinks were great, apps were delicious as was the main course. We also made sure to make room for dessert. The atmosphere was terrific with the movie playing in the background and the live belly dancer. We will be back again!
May 24, 2013|Good, if limited, Indian cuisine|3|We enjoyed the dinners we had but were sorry the menu was so limited. Having been in India we were expecting a wider range of vegetarian options and items such as paratha. However the preparation of our order was competent and correctly spiced. Unfortunately service was marred by our server forgetting our bread order of roti, such that the bread arrived mid-meal after a reminder. My vegetarian saag was of course quite liquid and I had intentionally omitted rice, meaning to use the roti as a scoop. We did enjoy the ambience and will try the restaurant again.
May 23, 2013|Awesome|5|The food was amazing. Our server was outstanding. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent suggestions. The prices are a little higher than the average restaurant but its well worth it. Bread basket is awesome, curry is bessss, samosas were to die for and the mango margarita was heaven. A definite place to repeat.
May 11, 2013|it was ok|2|This was our first time here and i am not enthusiastic about returning. It was OK and the service was mediocre. I wish we would have had a better experience.
May 11, 2013|Always a great meal.|5|We try to go to India Restaurant several times a year. If we lived closer, we would be regulars. The food is always great; complex flavors in just the right proportions. Favorite appetizers are Aloo tikki, Samosas and the lamb chops. We usually get the Masala curry as an entree- swordfish or lamb are both great. The naan breads are excellent: honey/ginger and red onion/cilantro are favorites. Try a Mango Colada. On our most recent visit with friends, we noted how nice the atmosphere is at India-especially compared to some other Indian restaurants we have been to.
April 30, 2013|Disappointed with Server|4|It was buy one and get 50% off, however when the bill came, I was told that my meal was only 40% off with the explanation that was the managers call. Very disappointed, been here many times. Not sure I will go back.

March 5, 2013|India is divine|5|One of our favorite places, the staff is excellent and the food is fantastic. The decor transports you to India.
February 25, 2013|Excellent Indian Cuisine|5|I should say that my high ratings for ambiance and noise (very quiet) are in part due to reserving a quiet corner, which turned out to be a romantic nook with just four tables. My wife and I started with a grilled shrimp appetizer accompanied by nan bread, a wonderful combination. My wife's grilled vegetable entree was superb, and my chicken kabob dinner was almost perfect--the chicken being just a tad overcooked. Our waiter was very attentive and polite without being intrusive. As beer drinkers we were happy to have a pretty good selection to choose from, including several draft brews like Magic Hat No. 9 and Newcastle Ale, in either 14 or 24-ounce servings. Considering the quality of the food the prices are quite reasonable. Excellent!
February 22, 2013|We have been three times and|5|We have been three times and love it!!! The food is delicious and service was great.
February 2, 2013|Great Food - Long Wait for a table|4|What amazing food and entertainment, stunning quality and taste. Table service friendly and attentive. Attractive prices. Unique and high quality entertainment with a lovely dancer with swords and fans. So why only 5 stars? Despite having booked a table for 8pm, we were kept waiting until 8.45 for a table. For a restaurant with less good food we would have left after the first 15 minutes. The food made the wait worthwhile if somewhat annoying.
February 2, 2013|Will be back again!|5|Hadn't been to India in quite a while and decided to go back with our Dinner for Two coupon. As always, everything was great!! Reservation was a plus - got to the restaurant a little early and were able to enjoy a drink at the bar. Food was great - service was quick and we enjoyed the belly dancing too!

We had the spicy mussels, papri chaat, vegetable samosa and lots of Naan. Dinner was just as delicious! We all enjoyed the many different dishes such as the Seafood Mango, Lamb Kabobs, Peppered Duck in Tamarind Curry and the Crab & Shrimp special of the night. Even the kid’s pizzas were excellent! The atmosphere and service was outstanding! We all had a great time including our daughters who enjoyed the belly dancing and henna tattoos. We'll definitely be back in the summer to enjoy the beautiful outside patio dining but hope to return several times before then too!!
December 28, 2012|We started with the Spicy|4|We started with the Spicy Steamed Mussels paired with Garlic Naan for an appetizer, both of which were delicious. They weren't too spicy, and there was a lot of broth leftover, so I would recommend ordering multiple sides of Naan to soak up more the juices. I ordered the Peppered Duck in Tamarind Curry, which was phenomenal. The other patrons ordered the Chicken Kabobs and the Lamb Kabobs. I thought the Lamb Kabobs were slightly overcooked (they were not rare as requested) but good nonetheless, and the Chicken Kabobs were delicious as well. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.
December 25, 2012|The day we were there on our|4|The day we were there on our last visit they were short staffed due to an unanticipated crowd. We went on Christmas day and I can attest it was unanticipated as we have been going there on Christmas for the last 5 days and were floored at the crowd when we arrived. In spite of this the wait staff was very polite/solicitous and the food yummo. Will continue to frequent INDIA

December 19, 2012|First time to this restaurant.|5|First time to this restaurant. Some reviewers have complained that the food is not authentic. I don't know enough about authentic Indian food to tell, but can only say it was delicious. My wife had the mango curry with chicken and I had the chicken kabobs. Both were done perfectly. The Papri Chaat appetizer was also a wonderful treat. Looking forward to going back there again.
December 8, 2012|   Good spot |3|They should retrain all the servers and maybe have some of them work in teams so the can give better service to the customers. Food is good here and ambience wonderful

November 24, 2012|Hot Spices. Cool atmosphere.|4|"Note India's registered trademark: ""We add spice to your life."" If you like it really hot, this is the place to go. Try the Vindaloo curry sauce. Wow! Quite a kick. The less venturesome can select from 4 safe and sane levels of spice or stay home. Hot spices paired with a cool atmosphere: Bollywood movies play continuously on a large movie screen that stretches across the back of the main room and bar. Live Belly dancer performs in the aisle between tables. Friendly and Responsive staff. Our table for 4 was ready at the exact time of our OpenTable reservation and we were seated immediately (thank you)."
November 17, 2012|I've always had a great experience|4|"I've always had a great experience when dining at India. However, this time when arriving I found that despite my reservation they did not have my table available. They ""had to accomodate a party of six"" so my table was given to them and my party of 4 ended up waiting."
November 17, 2012|The restaurant needs to figure|2|The restaurant needs to figure out if in fact it is an Indian restaurant or Mexican or Spanish. The food is definitely not authentic while fairly tasty.
November 13, 2012|India|5|We had an outstanding server who made some great suggestions that we tried. Love the ambiance and the food. We were delighted to find that India had two curries for the price of one on Tuesday, the night we were there. We will definitely go back again.

Food is always great and the service is polite, responsive, and worth a full tip! We usually get the vegetarian appetizer and we added the mussels to our repertoire this visit and we were NOT in the least disappointed. This is a spot we'll both go for a date night as well as meet friends and bring guests.

April 18, 2012|Great service, good food,|3|Great service, good food, good cocktail, but was really surprised that a very violent movie was shown on the TV. The 13 yo in our group actually asked to change seats with me so that she would not face the screen. I know that we could have asked to have it changed. The fact is, with out my glasses, I couldn't even see it, and we were otherwise satisfied. Big disappointment that tandoori chicken is only available at week-end brunch--my daughter was bummed.

I felt good after eating the food and must say even after two helpings of the rice pudding, my blood sugar was fine. Excellent meal
March 20, 2012|SOOOOOOOOO YUMMMMMMMMMMM!|5|India remains one of our favorites! The duck and figs in tamarind sauce is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!
March 11, 2012|India Restaurant Five Star Dining|5|India is a perfect restaurant for a new person to try Indian food, the brunch menu allows a customer to try different foods without having to buy one dish. The various dishes have different spices ranging from mild to spicy. Get the India card and save 20% off every meal.

February 29, 2012|delights await you|5|We have been patrons of India Restaurant for many years. We never get bored. The menu is great, very vegetarian friendly. The staff is truly wonderful.
February 24, 2012|Swing chairs in the garden|3|We come to India a lot more so in the summer and sit out back in their swing chairs which are great. The decor and interior are fabulous they really have made it look and feel cosy. The food is okay they need to work on some things. It also flys out of the kitchen if you get apps expect your mains to arrive straight away or even before your apps are done. Service is excellent here the waiter was really friendly. Go here for a great ambience and maybe order your appetisers and wait to order your entrees. Belly dancer and henna artist was a nice touch!
February 18, 2012|The food was delicious and|4|The food was delicious and creative. The menu was varied and interesting. The wait staff helpful and accommodating. Unfortunately, the belly-dancing floor show was much, much too loud and distracting.
February 13, 2012|Went here for a birthday dinner.|4|Went here for a birthday dinner. Loved it. Always have a great meal here. Enjoy.
February 11, 2012|It was mine and my husbands|4|It was mine and my husbands first time at India. We had heard about it and read about it. SO we went there for our Valentines date. The food was awesome, our server was very nice and attentive, the ambiance was cozy and romantic. They sat us next to the fireplace, which was nice. The food was amazing. I had never had lamb chops, and it was tasty and moist, with basmati rice and kale salad. My husband had the duck which was also very good. I would definitely go there again and recommend them to my friends...
February 11, 2012|A true gem|4|The food is always excellent. The service is always great. Our server was most helpful and knowlegable of the menu. The decor is perfect for the theme of the restaurant.

February 4, 2012|Decadent, delightful, delicious!|5|Wonderful atmosphere. Very intimate service. The food has such flavor! I would eat here everyday if I could!
February 3, 2012|yummy food, good service|4|"Food was rated by all five of us as ""Great!"" and we all had something different. The service was very good, although waiter did forgot a substitute for rice. On a Friday night, we had a reservation but had about a 10-15 minute wait. It was fairly noisy but once we were seatedin our little alcove, we could hear each other."
February 2, 2012|Good Traditional Indian Fare|4|Well prepared traditional Indian cuisine, warm ambience, and efficient service make this a solid addition to one's restaurant roatation. The menu is varied enough to keep diners interested and coming back for more.
January 15, 2012|Healthy Indian in cozy atmosphere|3|"Nice, cozy atmosphere. Traditional Indian fare ""healthied up"" a bit. For example, the samosas are baked, not fried, and they don't use as much--or any-- butter. With this in mind, results are mixed. The lamb chop kabobs (not a kabob really but 5 juicy, perfectly marinated chops) over a kale/cucumber salad and grilled sweet potatoes was awesome! Chops were hot, juicy, super tasty and not gamy at all and the cool, crisp lemony salad was a very nice contrast. The chicken masala was fine but nothing to write home about. The masala and samosas probably suffer from the no fried, no butter philosophy in a way that the grilled items don't. Good place to enjoy Indian without packing on 1000s of calories in one meal, though. Sangria was good, too"
January 15, 2012|Great Dining At A Decent Price|5|The first time I have ever eaten Indian food, The word Curry conjures up dishes that are very spicy, however we found some dishes spicy,while some were not. The buffet is a great way to taste a variety of foods.
January 14, 2012|Always a hit|5|"Tucked on the East Side of Providence, accessible without going downtown with plenty of parking. Eclectic, colorful and warm w/ glowing candles and white lights. Sit in a swing seat on the back terrace! Great weeknight specials and on weekends, belly dancers swirl to Indian music. I love this, and they are not intrusive and don't hover by your table or make it awkward; they simply perform a couple of routines periodically in an open area. Food is amazingly pungent & spicy and prepared to order; nothing is made ahead of time. The papri chaat (house special) Indian ""nachos"", a nirvana (ginger infused martini), and something from the grill with the kale salad is always my favorite. You have to have the basket of assorted Naan!"
December 31, 2011|A wonderful night!|5|My husband and I were a bit wary of trying a new restaurant on New Year's Eve but we took the chance. I am so very glad we did! Our experience at India was wonderful. From the moment we walked in the door we felt like V.I.P. customers. The service was attentive, the atmosphere was fun and romantic and the food was incredible. We enjoyed our entire evening.

December 31, 2011|We love India! The food and|5|We love India! The food and drinks are always delicious, the atmosphere is a delight. This time we sat near a cozy fire but the patio in back is great in the warm weather. We've also enjoyed their Jazz Night - jazz with an Indian flair! All around always a delicious, sensual experience!
December 27, 2011|Uh-oh|2|"Worst ""psedo indian"" food we have ever had sorry to say. Our party of 6 who I brought specially to this restuarant was very disappointed. Granted they were slamming busy but never heard of kale used as a staple in every dish. Even the simple things like rice were overcooked. Spicing if you want to call it that was pitiful. The waiter was accommodating with an overtired hungry child who kept changing her mind and rushed her multiple requests. Really a disappointment."
December 25, 2011|Lacking Quality|1|My husband and I have ate at this restaurant several tmes. We have found that the quality of the food has been slowly declining. Since we love the ambiance at India, we did make a reservation for Christmas. We received an email from the restaurant that they would be having Christmas specials and special activites. Perhaps we arrived too late, but there was nothing special taking place here. Upon sitting down, we ordered drinks and an appetizer, which both came out within minutes. While eating the appetizer, we were told that they were closing and needed to order.The food did come out promptly, but with the exception of the rice, it was cold and not of good quality. When the waiter did come over, we were told the chef left for the night.
Dined on December 25, 2011|Christmastime at India|5|India never disappoints. If you like sweet dishes, the peppered duck in tamarind curry is delicious. Served with fig and hazelnuts, it makes for a unique Christmastime meal. “Home” infused vodkas made from real ingredients frequently create a top shelf cocktail. Find an excuse to have a drink with ginger infused vodka. If you like your martinis on the sweeter side, try the Nirvana – ginger vodka, Grand Marnier, lemon juice in a brown sugar rimmed glass. India is consistently good and has always had many specials and promotions to bring customers back. The bar specials starting at only one dollar are great and affordable for the after work drink.
December 25, 2011|Could not have been better...|5|Great place. We went on Christmas night to celebrate my wifes birthday and were very pleased with our experience. Great food, good service, and nice place. In our party we had the duck (great!) lamb saag (great!) and a vegitarian dish (also great!). Big bonus for us was the large selection of vegitarian friendly food. We plan to go back in the spring/summer to sit outside on what looked like a very nice patio! Oh yea also dog friendly when outdoor seating is avialable. Big + in our book! They even have a fido friendly portion of the menu. We will be back!
December 18, 2011|We had the Sunday buffet.|3|We had the Sunday buffet. The food was good. The service was very friendly and attentive. They were a bit disappointing on choices at the buffet. But overall OK. If we lived closer we would repeat.
December 10, 2011|Me and my girlfriend visit|5|Me and my girlfriend visit your restaurant for every special occasion. Great food and atmosphere.
December 3, 2011|Great experience! Highly Recomend!|5|Great Food and comfortable seating. This was one of the first Indian restaurants I have gone to and I was very impressed with the food quality. The food was very fresh and delicious. The menu had a lot to offer. I especially liked the fact that they use a fair amount of mango sauces which is very tasty. The deserts are absolutely delicious and the lamb chops are a favorite along with the kale salad. Wow I could go on but you have to give it a try if you have never had Indian food. Like I said I was very pleasantly surprised and now recommend this restaurant to everyone I know.
November 19, 2011|We took our two young children|4|We took our two young children on a Saturday night (early) and found there to be plenty of stimuli for them - Bollywood movies, belly dancers and generally lively atmosphere. The food is always good. Nothing too fancy but certain stylized Indian food. It was a little spicy for the kids but nothing they couldn't handle. The naan bread baskets are standouts - get them every time.
November 19, 2011|Never would have found without|4|Never would have found without Open Table. We don't venture to that area of Providence. We will return. One of the best India food places we've visited.
November 13, 2011|Great Food and Pet Friendly!|4|I had some friends in town with their dog and we decided to hit up India because they're dog friendly and because they have lots of vegetarian/vegan options. They were extremely accommodating and the food was delicious! I've had Indian food at a couple different places before and I really enjoyed the food here - it was cooked to perfection and came out quickly and hot. Prices were reasonable and the menu has a million different options to choose from. I look forward to going back soon!
November 5, 2011|The food was great which made|4|The food was great which made up for the inconsistent service. This is a fantastic choice for people with wheat allergies who create more than the choice of a salad off the menu. The ambiance was vibrant and warm. The surprise of the meal was when the entertainment stared in the form of a belly dancer.

October 23, 2011|Foodie Review|3|I went to the India Restaurant for my girlfriends birthday at her request. She is a foodie, and this is one of her favorite places to eat. The service was great, the music was pleasant, and we got the private dining area as requested. The only negative comment came from the foodie herself who got her usual currie dish, only to find it overly dry. It seemed as if the sauce was applied while the rice was still too hot, and it absorbed the majority of the liquid. It would have been an outstanding night, except for the food preparation. I would stil recommend the India Restaurant, and chalk it up to a bad night...
October 23, 2011|We were pleasantly surprised|5|We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of service, food and drink, as well as ambience! We will go back again and recommend to friends.
October 2, 2011|What a delightful find! Food|5|What a delightful find! Food was excellent, the portions generous, and the prices reasonable. Service was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Special touch was the live music with flute & drum. We will definitely be back soon!
October 1, 2011|India was a really fun place|4|India was a really fun place to eat. While not a traditional Indian restaurant the fusion of the foods provided a great experience and a very fun night out. The atmosphere was inviting and comfortable, the entertainment (a belly dancer and someone providing a free henna service!) was a very nice touch and the waitstaff was attentive and very polite, respectful and spot on. Our food was fantastic, especially the naan! I look forward to bringing some friends there and hopefully, when the warm weather returns, enjoying dinner on their patio some time!

September 16, 2011|Yummmm|5|My husband and I had never had Indian food until a friend told us that we had to go to India. We're hooked, the food is amazing - so many flavors and textures. They're really busy on Friday and Sat night so I'd recommend a reservation but its worth it to see the belly dancer, she is very talented. We haven't tried their brunch yet but its next on the list. We've been 4 times in the past 6 months and even my picky 19 year old daughter found something she liked on the menu....Highly recommended!!
September 10, 2011|Great time at India|5|We had an amazing time at India. The food was excellent and the ambiance was festive. There are two lovely outdoor seating areas. Two of the four in our group were vegetarians and there were many options from which to chose.
September 3, 2011|Sorry I waited so long.....|5|This was our first time trying this Gem of a restaurant . We found it on Open Table , we enjoy trying new places . The food was wonderful and service was fantastic, our waiter helped with menu selections so we could try a different array of foods. Wevstarted with Bhel Puri along with the bread basket 1/2 order which gives you a taste of all 6 flavors. For our entree we shared to different entrees one spicy and one mild, the Vindaloo curry and a coconut curry with tiger shrimp and lobster. ( both excellent ). We ended our meal with the pineapple mango banana split. Cocktails were equally delicious ( Nivana cocktail and Taj Mahal beer ) We will definitely be back soon......
August 30, 2011|Excellent. Menue items are|5|Excellent. Menue items are a variation on traditional Indian cooking, lighter but with all the traditional flavor. We shared a Bryani and a Grilled melon salad and had more than enough for two. We added a mango banana split and coffee to top it off. We will be going back soon. There were two dog friendly tables on the sidewalk. they were complete with a place to tie the leash and specdial menue items for your pet.
August 20, 2011|Date Night!|4|Love the atmosphere of this place. Went on a date here and it was lovely. Food was delish, as this was my first experience with Indian cuisine and I loved it!

August 18, 2011|Experenced Indian Food lover|5|Excellent service, Excellent food, decent prices and with an ice cream shop next door and a park across the street. It is the best indian spot in RI. They had a jazz band the night we went. Though not my type of music it was my husbands type and he loved it. It was quiet enough to hold a private conversation without yelling and loud enough to enjoy.
