February 20, 2016|Not the best dinning experience; will try again|2|Excellent atmosphere. Food: appetizers (beet salad and cauliflower) were delicious. Short rib entree was good. The taste and presentation of the chicken entree was concerning to me and I instantly regretted ordering the chicken; very disappointed with the chicken, do not order the chicken. I wish I ordered something else, will likely try the lamb next time. Service: did not receive bread until after the meal. Asked for water without ice, got served water with ice. Overall impression: inattentive waiter.
February 19, 2016|The Beet Salad and Mushroom Risotto were excellent|5|The service was very good, food excellent and atmosphere lovely. I loved the architecture of the building and would dine there again.
February 14, 2016|Food OK Cocktails Superb|3|I make superior roasted chicken and mashed potatoes and many other restaurants do as well. The fresh pasta with lobster was good though. Dessert was underwhelming. The cocktails were the highlight of the evening.
February 12, 2016|A Jewel|5|Walking into the Dorrence makes me feel like I've stepping back into the Jazz Age and might expect F. Scott Fitzgerald to be two tables over. The food is fabulous, drinks creative and you can't beat the decor and ambiance. A local favorite.
February 5, 2016|Our favorite restaurant in Providence|5|Everything is just right here - beautiful room, superb food, delicious cocktails, excellent staff. The Dorrance is elegant, yet laid-back. In a city with a remarkably high number of great restaurants, this remains our favorite.
January 30, 2016|Outstanding Service|4|The service from when we walked in until we left was wonderful - check in, taking our coats at the door, and throughout the meal. They were still offering their Restaurant Week meal which we enjoyed.
January 15, 2016|The Dorrance has been on my list for awh...|4|The Dorrance has been on my list for awhile to try. It was my girlfriends birthday that weekend, and we we're going to the Patriots playoff game on Saturday, so we figured lets make it a weekend. We came in from Boston last Friday night (1/15), stayed @ the Omni right downtown. We're foodies and like to try different restaurants all over the east coast-- Providence has great values and is a very over looked city in my opinion. We had reservations for two at 8:00. Arrived a little early, got sat quickly. (Friday 1/15). Gentlemen in the glasses took us right away-- Good Start. Place is beautiful; great ambiance, open ceilings, a wider restaurant than most.. Good flow to the place. To our luck it was restaurant week, so we had the options of choosing either menu. The prefix menu for restaurant week was 3 courses for $35 dollars. Our waiter was solid. Great young guy, good seller on drinks and apps- Checked on us casually-- we we're never asking where is our waiter!? Exactly what you want when you want to dine, especially for a good occasion. We chose for the pre fix menu which seems always to be a little different than the usual. To sum it up.. Our Food came out timely, and for the most part was good. My only critic were that the Portions however were small, kind of thought that with the low price tag. Temps we're on point, seasoned well, hot came out hot, cold came out cold. Dessert was not only satisfying on the eye, but it was downright delicious. Boy oh Boy pastry chef know's whats up. (Probably one of the best creme brulee's I had in a while, texture was on point). My only con would be not to have people on their phones greeting you, its just bad for any hospitality business. Not having anyone anyone greet you when leaving-lasting impressions are everything to new diners. I walked into the Dorrance with above par expectations and that's exactly what we got. I would come back, and recommend it to any foodies going into providence. 7/10.
January 15, 2016|Great Ambiance|5|Great evening it you want a great ambiance and a little fun. Live music was great!
January 14, 2016|Went for Restaurant Week|2|Have been dying to try the Dorrance for 2 years! I want to say the service was great and the cocktails amazing. The food though was a huge disappointment. Wasn't worth the money, and wouldn't go back for dinner or lunch. Would return though for drinks and would tell friends and family to do the same.
January 14, 2016|Overpriced and very average entrees!|2|Don't go hungry. Beautiful building. Nice bar. Will not rush back nor recommend!
January 9, 2016|Prompt service|3|"We went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. I liked that they kept the interior as it was when this space was a bank. I had a risotto dish, the scallops were cooked just right, but the risotto could have used a little more liquid, the rice was still just on the crunchy side - a bit more than al dente. My husband had the porkchops which he thought were good. We didn't have any of the signature cocktails, but there were a few on the menu which looked intriguing. I was disappointed with the dessert menu however, and we didn't have any dessert. The waiter was attentive but could have not called us ""guys"" every other sentence. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I would go back, but maybe not soon."
January 7, 2016|What a beautiful spot!|5|Staying at the nearby Biltmore Hotel, was looking for a place to eat within walking distance instead of cabbing it to Federal Hill and was happy to find the Dorrance within a block. This old bank is absolutely stunning on the inside! The wait staff greeted us immediately and like we were all childhood friends. The Espresso Martinis are highly recommended. The menu selection had enough to satisfy our palate and the food was delicious. This was a nice find and we know we will be back. Highly recommend!
December 19, 2015|Perfect Holiday Dining Experience|4|Food: great Wine and Cocktails:great Atmosphere is so fabulous and the Lounge is enjoyable
December 15, 2015|Elegant place can't say the same for the food|3|It is rare that I give a bad review. The Dorrance is a nice looking place with a great bar. The staff was friendly and professional. The food however was so so.
December 5, 2015|Not impressed...|2|I booked a reservation here for dinner with my boyfriend and we both were not impressed. The food was decent, but overpriced for the quality that we got. Our server was a tad bit rude when we didn't order any alcoholic beverages (lifestyle choice) and when I ordered a salad due to dietary restrictions and allergies. Not going back here ever again.
November 28, 2015|Dinner after the theater|5|Wonderful food, unique, beautiful building, friendly welcoming staff all around. I've already recommended it to friends, and I will be back.
November 27, 2015|Great for Drinks!|5|The drinks here were top notch & we enjoyed our meal, but for the price the portions are EXCEPTIONALLY small. Would definitely go back for some late night drinks at the bar, but would rather eat dinner somewhere else.
November 20, 2015|Excellent service was above and beyond!|5|The manager was kind enough honor our odd request to print our6 PPAC tickets when we realized we had left them at home. She had us email her the on line tickets, print them in her office, and delivered them to our table. We had an awesome dinner and drinks, and made it to the show with no delays. Everyone was so nice and helpful about the whole thing.
October 30, 2015|Worth A Visit|4|Went for dinner based on reputation. The cocktails and food did not disappoint. Nice presentation and delicious. My only complaints are they were cheap with the bread (Two pieces with boring olive oil and extra charge if you wanted more) And also very noisy, from the bar, not conducive for quiet conversation. A vibrant bustling scene and excellent food.
October 24, 2015|Slow kitchen hurts|3|I like this place, but this time the kitchen was crazy slow. It took almost 30 minuets to get our entrees. Other parties who arrived after us received their food before us. This wouldn't be so bad if my friend and I didn't order only entrees. We had movie tickets, so we didn't have all night, and the slow kitchen made this situation worse.
October 24, 2015|Dorrance|4|The service and ambiance were outstanding. Both dinners were just OK. A little disappointing. Not for Foodies
October 24, 2015|Great cocktails and entrees!|4|We really enjoyed our dinner here with great service. The waitress was very helpful in navigating the cocktail menu and for meal recommendations (Duck special and swordfish were both excellent) The restaurant is a little chilly but love the decor. While the entree was great dessert and coffee was a little disappointing and could be better.
October 16, 2015|Fun dining experience|5|Great setting. Food was all good and nice proportions. Not too big. Nice wine selection. Had a good Barolo. Got pretty loud towards the end of the meal with a band playing. Hard to hear the conversation.
October 7, 2015|Good. Not Great|3|Service was good and so was most of the food. The steak tasted a little old. The place is beautiful. It was really slow on the night we went, so it was a little weird eating in such this big space without anyone around you. Might be back on a weekend when it's busier.
October 2, 2015|Food is good, not great.  Drinks are great.|3|We started at the bar, which is great. They have a great selection, and very knowledgeable bartenders. We then moved to dinner. The service was good, but the food was just ok. We tried to order something off-menu, and it was relatively disappointing. I would suggest you stick to menu items.
September 5, 2015|Beautiful Dinner|4|It was love at first sight then again at first bite. The site is unique, decor is elegant and the dinning area and bar are well appointed. The food was delicious and each plate so meticulously presented as to border on fine art. My wife and I are looking forward to our next visit. She even suggested that we get married again so that we could have the reception there. Thank you to everyone at The Dorrance for a truly memorable experience.
September 4, 2015|Beautiful place. Great food.|3|I enjoyed the dinner at The Dorrance. The live band was a bit loud for dinner time; the type of music clashed a bit with the elegant environment. Very enthusiastic wait staff. Delicious cocktails.
August 7, 2015|Just missed|4|Beautiful building in down town Providence. The chilled corn and crab soup was fantastic and my lamb dish was wonderful. My wife had the ceasar salad and enjoyed it , but felt that the tuna special was a little lacking in flavor and presentation . We where both disappointed that, the cheese board, that was on their online menu was not available when we got to the restaurant . It was our first time at the Dorrance, and will give it another go!
August 1, 2015|Great spot!|5|Our group of 7 dined here on Saturday night. Beautiful building, and wonderful service. We all enjoyed our meals and found the creative drink menu fun. Tried several of the drinks -- all were delicious. My only complaint was the music. It was a bit loud and made it difficult for our older diner (90 years old!) to hear. Other than that it was a great choice. If we lived closer, we would go back.
July 30, 2015|Beautiful Space|4|The ambience is great. Amazing converted former bank space. Dishes all sounded very interesting when viewed on menu but the flavors did not come together. Curried cauliflower very good but little dabs of sauces did not really add anything. Scallops on a corn succotash with pancetta where the pancetta completely overwhelmed the delicious seared scallops. Rack of lamb had an an olive tapenade that masked the flavor of the lamb. Chef is over reaching with ingredient combinations that just don't come together and mask rather than enhance the wonderful flavors of he main ingredients.
July 24, 2015|A mixed experience|3|"Let's start with the positives.... great romantic ambiance, likeable waiter, reasonable noise level for a cavernous room (former bank), and good food. We had a good time! It is great for a special occasion or a group gathering. However, like too many restaurants these days, they seem to have forgotten that the purpose of dining is eating! Small portions and overpriced meals, even during Providence Restaurant Week ($35 for three small courses). This was a time to shine as a restaurant that some people hadn't been to before (like us). But the salad was simple greens, the swordfish dinner consisted of three small pieces with a modest assortment of vegetables, and the sirloin steak was good but somewhat sinewy. The desserts were of high quality and excellently presented, but ""mini"" in nature. The panna cotta was very good. The ice cream and sherbet dessert selection was embarrassingly small. And yet, once again, the desserts were of good quality and well presented. This restaurant wants badly to believe that presentation and quality over quantity is what diners want. We disagree, and consequently won't return to this restaurant, unless invited by others. It wouldn't take much to make this a great restaurant in the right leadership hands, and be a great asset for the City of Providence."
July 23, 2015|anding space. Only negative: tiny portion|3|Delicious food. Beautiful space. Great bar. Genuinely friendly waitress. Only negative- tiny entre portion.
July 22, 2015|I Will Return|4|Went during restaurant week and enjoyed the Porcini Tortolloni immensely!! The rich mushrooms and perfectly cooked tortolloni were draped in a savvory olive oil. I would like to be eating it again right now!! The portion was just right for me, however someone with a heartier appetite would have found the portion too small. The curried cauliflower was delectable too. My friend enjoyed her swordfish-- Very good food (wish they had more cabernets by the glass) phenomenal building!
July 18, 2015|little disappointed in the kitchen|3|the atmosphere and décor is wonderful....our waiter Jim was great. unfortunately, can't say that for the kitchen....everything took forever to come out...app, entrée and dessert/coffee...even the waiter was frustrated! they need more kitchen cooks especially when it's restaurant week. will try again another time because the place is so beautiful...hope it will be better.
July 17, 2015|Great service underwhelming food|4|The service, presentation, and ambience were amazing but the food and drinks were underwhelming. Ordered a sirloin and 1/3 was inedible fat and grizzle which is not acceptable at this level of restaurant. Portions are too small as it is to lose a 1/3. It was overcooked as well. Their drinks have 'odd' additions (jalapeño, ginger, etc). We went out for girls night and could not find a drink we liked. Waiter was amazing and attentive!!!
July 15, 2015|Had a wonderful dinner here on Wednesday...|5|Had a wonderful dinner here on Wednesday night. Our server was attentive and friendly. She made sure everything was to our liking and was a pleasure to talk to. We ate off of the restaurant week menu and enjoyed everything. The mussels, salad and steak were all very good, but the dessert was the real highlight of the meal. The decor is unlike any other restaurant in Providence, loved the high ceilings. Can't wait to return!
June 6, 2015|On the side we sat was under staffed cau...|3|On the side we sat was under staffed causing the service to be extremely slow, not acceptable at all for a location which always has struggle to establish
May 10, 2015|Beautiful building.  Food was just OK.|4|I was surprised to see that there were hardly any patrons in the restaurant at 2:30 pm on Mother's Day. The room was beautiful. The bar looked nice, but it was completely empty. Our waiter was very cordial and knowledgeable, but he neglected to ask us if he could replenish our drinks or get us another cocktail or glass of wine during dinner. My mom said the oysters were delicious. I ordered the lobster and filet dinner. It was just ok. The lobster was a little dry/overdone. The filet didn't have any seasonings/sauce and its natural flavor was average at best. My husband enjoyed the pork chop. The drink menu was quite unusual, but the waiter said The Dorrance is known for its unique drinks. The experience was OK. Adjacent guests seemed to be regulars there and their conversations were extremely loud and annoying as they shouted from one table to another. Not sure if I'd return, given the multitude of exceptional restaurants in Providence.
May 9, 2015|Always a winner|5|We always enjoy our meals and clever drinks at the Dorrance!! They never disappoint!!! Add a beautiful setting to the picture and the meal is complete!!
Dined on April 25, 2015|Very nice for pre-theater|4|"Very nice for pre theater. Beautiful restaurant , formerly a bank from the 1920s. Art Deco. Check out the ""vault' in the back. . . We were able to leave our car with the valet until after the show at PPAC. Next visit we will check out the jazz band in the lounge."
April 18, 2015|I made reservations for my wife and I at...|5|I made reservations for my wife and I at the Dorrance for our anniversary since we had had our wedding at a previous iteration of the location. We were happy to see the ownership had kept the extremely classy and unique interior that had attracted us to the establishment years earlier. Any changes that we noticed, such as to the seat decor or the bar area were definitely upgrades that only enhanced the establishment's ambiance. The staff was very courteous, which was even more appreciated considering we had brought along our 6 month old daughter and needed to turn a table for two into a larger space. They couldn't have been more accommodating! My wife very much enjoyed her pork chop and my filet mignon was a fantastic cut that seemed to melt in my mouth. Delicious! The drink menu also was every bit as unique as the place itself. Do yourself a favor and visit The Dorrance; you won't regret it!
April 4, 2015|Unique location, and great service|3|The historic bank building was wonderful and beautiful. Excellent wine list. Our server was knowledgeable and fun. The food was presented well, but main courses did not live up to expectations. Duck was very good, salmon was just OK, and Swordfish special was somewhat dry and bland. We'll probably give it another try, because others have said Dorrance offers great food.
March 28, 2015|Dorrance Delivered|5|We went to celebrate my husbands birthday. Our server, Kaylie, was excellent. She was just the right blend of friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. She was genuine and helpful but not hovering. Please give her a thank you from us. We started by sharing the curried cauliflower...which hit all the right notes. My husband had the braised short ribs which were good. I had the sea bass which was cooked perfectly. We finished with the spiced chocolate bar....having watching our neighboring table devour theirs. My husband said the Dorrance ranks among those meals we have had that are so memorable that you can recall them with one word....or dish. What more could you ask for on a special occasion.
March 28, 2015|Food was very good, as were the drinks.....|5|Food was very good, as were the drinks.... It was a bit pricey though
March 28, 2015|Giles Coren Was Right.|4|My wife and I went to the Dorrance for our night out in Providence, as we had driven in from our stay at the Ocean House (which I cannot recommend enough) for a quiet dinner. Well, we arrived a little after 5 and it was quite dead for Saturday night, but then again, they had just opened. We were seated at a table away from the bar and greeted by our waitress. She was absolutely lovely and a highlight of our evening. We both ordered drinks from the bar and waited patiently. The drinks were well received by myself and my wife, probably one of the best Old fashioned's I've ever had. Now, is where the experience drops off. We had the Burrata Caprese as our starter. The Burrata was runny, I mean milky water covered half the plate, and it became instantly unappetizing. My wife had the Chicken and Dumplings, which was quite good, except for the size (small) and quantity (3) of her dumplings. I eagerly dove into my Pappardelle and Lobster. The pasta was cooked perfectly, but unfortunately, the Lobster was rubber and inedible. We were hesitant about ordering dessert, but figured we might as well, so we went with Oops! I Dropped the Pie! It was a creative presentation and actually, quite good. Overall, the place was beautiful, the service was excellent, and the drinks were wonderful. So, stay for a drink , but just go elsewhere for food
February 27, 2015|Very beautiful location, food was wonderful|4|Very interesting cocktails. Very tasty - a must try.
February 14, 2015|Awesome food. Better drinks.|5|Food was great. Drinks were even better. David was our waiter and took excellent care of us. Definitely will be going again soon.
February 13, 2015|Valentine' day|5|Wonderful food and excellent service... Beautiful restaurant!
February 6, 2015|"Very pretty but food is sort of ""meh"""|3|"I enjoyed The Dorrance but will probably not go back. Service was good and the cocktails were interesting and tasty. Downfalls: bread starter was dry and uninspired and was served without butter. Food was expensive and one in our party had to send back a meal that was cold. I got the filet which was very tasty and nicely prepared. $9 ice cream ""flight"" was incredibly disappointing - barely a bite of each of 3 flavors. ""Oops I dropped the pie"" was equally stingy and disappointing. Plusses: attentive and friendly service, pretty and romantic decor, valet parking."
January 31, 2015|Excellent!|5|Been there for a work party before but never just for dinner. It was terrific. Calamari was one of the best I've had, and the Wedge salad with homemade bluecheese had great presentation and flavor. Duck was of great quality, and the Lamb Tenderoin/Chop Duo was best of both lamb worlds. My only complaint is that some of the portions could have been a little bigger, such as the scallops and the calamari. They only gave three scallops, when really four or five would have been more appropriate.
January 24, 2015|Restaurant Week Deal!|5|"Went for a restaurant week dinner. Followed the menu, and boy was it great! Nice service, and the soup was ""out of this world!"" Great drinks, great courses, great service. Winner!"
December 30, 2014|wait for it...|2|the waits between courses were much too long... I recommend The Dorrance but wait...add it to the end of your 'restaurants to try' list...
December 20, 2014|This is a delightful find.|4|The setting in a former bank is wonderful, with a high, ornate ceiling, magnificent stained glass windows, yet simply furnished in more contemporary style. The food was delicious and perfectly prepared. Our server, a Johnson and Wales student, was delightful and thoroughly conversant with the preparation of each dish. The swing music in the background was set at just the right volume so as not to compete with table conversation in any way. The only short side of this experience was the noise level, likely due to the highly polished marble floors.
December 19, 2014|Dinner Before the Show|5|Very good overall experience. Service was excellent...timed our meal perfectly. Great cocktails and busy after work bar scene. In a party of eight all of us were delighted with our meals.
December 13, 2014|Great holiday date|5|Dinner last Saturday was my second visit to the Dorrance. I’m highlighting that because it isn’t often that I eat at a restaurant for the first time and immediately declare it a must-return destination. But that was the case with the Dorrance, so when I scheduled my recent trip to Providence I made sure it was on the itinerary. The restored bank building, with its high ceilings, ornate architecture and marble floors, is a gorgeous venue that combines historical elegance with a very inviting and current vibe. The tasteful holiday decorations and live jazz music were a bonus this trip. Every restaurant review, ultimately, is about the food, and I will discuss that in a second. But for me what was most notable on both visits to the Dorrance was the service. Our server on both occasions, David, is a pro and was very attentive. He was personable, knowledgeable and made excellent suggestions on dinner and wine. His skill reminded me again that this is not just a family-owned restaurant, it is family run. The owner is on premises; her sons work in the restaurant. And you feel that commitment from the minute you enter the revolving doors, through the meal and into your final goodbye. We started with an appetizer of amazing fresh raw oysters, with just the right wines as a paring, followed by the pork chop and braised short rib entrees, which we matched with different wines. Each dish was delicious and presented beautifully. Throughout we also learned about the food itself, how the wines were selected and the history of this fabulous venue. I arrived as a fan, and left a devotee. I would highly recommend the Dorrance. It's the perfect spot for a romantic dinner, a night out with friends or any special occasion. My only question now is what will David and the incredible staff do next time I’m in town to exceed last Saturday night.
December 5, 2014|Great dinner, Nice waiter...no water!|4|We loved our dinner here. Our only complaint is that the very pleasant waiter didn't offer us additional cocktails or refill our water. We both sat with empty glasses through our entire entrée. I wouldn't let that stop me from returning, however; I will just be a bit more demanding.
November 28, 2014|great place for dinner and drinks|5|The hand crafted cocktails are excellent, decent beer selection and the menu is nice. We shared the duck confit w/pumpkin risotto and the Po Burger. Both were excellent and would definitely try other menu items next time. The vibe is very cool and relaxed. There is bar, lounge and table seating.
November 28, 2014|Great experience|5|The food was excellent, the service was outstanding, the staff was pleasant and attentive making for a very enjoyable evening.
November 26, 2014|Beautiful space, it was an former bank entrance|4|It has high ceilings worked like antiques, the same with the windows, it has the old vault inside that is opened and transformed into a small lounge! It is a very special place
November 21, 2014|Can't wait to go back!|5|My husband and I moved to RI recently and finally had a chance to dine at the Dorrance. We loved it. The cocktails are inventive and the food delicious. There was live music playing when we left and I wish I could have stayed later. Looking forward to going back!
November 6, 2014|Great dinner|4|we had been traveling all day and checked Open Table for restaurants near where we were staying downtown Providence and the Dorrance appeared in the list. We reserved and about a half hour later were enjoying a wonderful meal, with attentive service and great wine. Will go back if we are in the area. Recommended it to friends that live closer.
October 17, 2014|Very average dining|2|Went to try the Dorrance, before a play. Ordered oysters as an appetizer. They were very small and bland. They tasted like they had been rinsed under cold water before being served. For dinner we went dual seafood. Wife got the Fig Tortolloni, which was very bland as well. I got the Lobster/pasta dish. Waiter glowed about it, told us it had the 'meat of two whole chicken lobsters, claws/knuckles'. Now, when he said that, I expected a lot of lobster meat, including the tail. Instead, there was barely any lobster at all... just 2 small claws and a couple of pieces of knuckle. Overall it was similarly bland and unmemorable. The service was attentive and it was a nice place, but the food was very disappointing. Just bland.
October 11, 2014|One Year Wedding Anniversary|5|My husband and I have been wanting to try The Dorrance for quite some time and felt that it was the perfect place to go to for our one year wedding anniversary. The decor was stunning and I particularly liked how each table was set farther apart from the other so as to create more privacy for you and your companions. We had David as our server and he was very attentive, knowledgeable and personable. He even brought over a complimentary glass of champagne for us to toast. The food was delicious and properly portioned so there were no leftovers. (We lived overseas for school so we were used to the smaller plates.) Overall, we had a very memorable and romantic experience.
October 11, 2014|Very good!|4|Beautiful building, in and out. Service was very good. Our waiter ( Jim) was perfect! He never rushed us, made good suggestions. The decor was beautiful, marbel throughout, like dining in a Newport mansion. We had the rack of lamb. It was very good although the drinks and dinners wouldn't be considered large portions. ( the portions are just big enough for me not to complain) My guess is nobody brings home a doggy bag. My only real complaint is... the valet parking. Pulled up to the valet area and waited 10 minutes for the valet to appear. They have 1 valet to park cars 2 blocks away on a Saturday night at dinner time? Had to wait another 10 minutes to get my car back.
October 8, 2014|Went to the Dorrance on the recommendati...|4|Went to the Dorrance on the recommendation of a friend. It did not disappoint. Beautiful ambiance, great jazzy background music which fit the atmosphere perfectly. Very romantic. Service was outstanding. Food was very tasty. Our only complaint were the entrée portions. Too small for the price. We don't mind paying $30+ for an entrée but assumed we would go home full, which we did not. That being said, everything else was top notch so we will definitely be going back.
October 8, 2014|Wonderful experience|4|One of the most elegant and romantic dinner venues in providence. Its atmosphere and decor transports you back in time.
October 3, 2014|Best in Providence|5|Everything about the Dorrance is just right - fabulously elegant surroundings, yet the restaurant is comfortable and welcoming - thoughtfully inventive dishes without ever being pretentiously experimental - staff is helpful and informative without verbosity or weird chumminess. The Dorrance is great. We already look forward to our next visit.
September 16, 2014|It was our first time going to the Dorra...|5|It was our first time going to the Dorrance but there will be many more to follow. I took someone in for his 30th birthday on Tuesday 9/16. I ordered the scallops and they were delicious. The plating was beautiful as well. We both have worked in the food industry and I just would like to point out that the service was perfect. We had Dave as a server. He was extremely attentive but not too much. He even brought over a complimentary birthday dessert with a candle to complete our evening there. It was much appreciated. We will definitely be back.
August 30, 2014|Nice....but|4|Overall, we enjoyed our dinner! The decor is beautiful which creates for a romantic setting. However there were people sitting upstairs and they were very loud. We could hear them downstairs. The waiter was very nice but he seemed a little impatient with our questions. The food was excellent but the portions were a little small. There were pros and cons.....enough pros to make a repeat visit. I would recommend this restaurant.
August 23, 2014|Exceeded expectations|5|Yelp had good reviews but not unanimously high, so I didn't know what to expect. I wanted to try out Dorrance especially because of the beautiful ambiance. All if the food and drinks were delicious- all three entres were winners, and we couldn't pick a favorite. My chicken was incredibly flavorful. Our waiter, Jim, was excellent. Friendly, accommodating, and also very real. He wasn't too formal but clearly is a pro. Kudos!
August 22, 2014|Extravagant|5|A great romantic ambience with a delicious menu and great one off drink list
August 16, 2014|Wedding Bell Blues|1|The primary problem was there was a wedding reception with an overly loud band taking place at the same time, and not separate from the regular dining. It ruined the atmosphere completely. Also, the food was only ordinary, not acceptable for a fine dining establishment. One of the dishes (duck) was inedible due to fat and veins. The restaurant offered a substitute meal, and removed all items consumed by that diner from the bill.
August 9, 2014|Stately and Tasty|5|Had a very relaxing meal at The Dorrance August 9th - perfect date night for weary parents like us. The wait staff was excellent, and the food was delicious. We enjoyed the Octopus appetizer, and both entrees were excellent - we were certainly members of the clean plate club that night. Perfect start to a Waterfire night.
August 9, 2014|Nice evening!|4|Couldn't have asked for better ambience or service in this detailed and restored building.Cocktails were amazing! Attention to detail in every way, except maybe the food;not just quite on par quality-wise or adventurous as we would have liked. Mussel app was good, but the baby octopus app was dry in a somewhat tasty broth. Our daughter's selection of sea scallops with a lovely pea risotto was the best entree of the three dishes. Husband's fig tortolani was interesting, but much too sweet for his tastes. Filet mignon entree was perfect at med rare, but the accompanying sauce really didn't complement the dish. Pots de Creme dessert-rich and luscious. Service impeccable! Overall, a lovely evening of returning to RI for vacation.
August 8, 2014|Great meal in a beautiful room.|4|"Started with one of their specialty cocktails. It was very nicely prepared. I had the pork chop. It was bit overcooked for my taste, but the preparation was otherwise quite good. The room is absolutely beautiful. Often you end up ""paying for the room"" in overpriced entrees and mediocre fare. Not here. The Dorrance has very good food and service at a fair prices for fine dining. I would definitely go back. If I lived in the neighborhood I would probably frequent the bar as well. They know their way around a cocktail."
August 7, 2014|Just Lovely|4|Went for dinner with a friend and had a great time. First of all the interior is gorgeous. The staff was friendly and knowledgable which is always a plus, and the good was delicious. We each did the $35 three course special which was well worth it. Overall a lovely dining experience. I'll be sure to return.
July 29, 2014|Impressive Space|2|We came to The Dorrance much more for the building than the food. The former bank space is impressive, but the food was just OK.
July 26, 2014|We keep coming back|4|We seated quickly by the hostess and promptly greeted by our server Jim. A round of their oh so delicious cocktails for the table and off to appetizers. We enjoyed the duck nuggets, ceviche and octopus for starters. All were very good. Dinner was a mixed bag. My friend ordered the duck that was tasty but a bit tough. The ladies ordered the Monkfish which was tough, overcooked and pretty lame. Shame on them for not sending it back. My chicken 3 ways was excellent. There are so many excellent restaurants in Providence to enjoy and The Dorrance is one of them. The place is drop dead gorgeous and Jim was our best server there yet. We keep going back but I think the cocktails are sometimes better than the food.
July 17, 2014|Restaurant Weeks winner|4|The Dorrance was the last of seven different new (to me) restaurants I tried, and unlik many of the others who tended to skimp with their RW menu, the Dorrance went all in. Uncompromising quality in terms of food, service, and ambience. They demonstrated that their regular menu is likely well worth the price point--which, to me, is part of the joy/point of RW. Will definitely return as a go-to establishment to treat myself or to take special guests.
Dined on July 17, 2014|Underwhelmed|4|While our server was great - respectfully attentive, helpful and knowledgeable - the food itself was somewhat disappointing. The entrees (wild mushroom gnocchi and flank steak) did not match the menu description. The portions were small. The flank steak, while cooked as ordered and tasty, had no vegetable with it. We visited during Restaurant Week. One would think that they would try to impress as many people use RW as an opportunity to try new restaurants. None of us are in a hurry to go back.
July 11, 2014|Lovely find|4|We visited during restaurant week which allowed us to try a variety of dishes. The strawberry gazpacho was a delightful appetizer and the chicken 3 ways was delicious.
July 8, 2014|AMAZING!|5|I loved everything about this place. The service was top notch as well as the food. I will be back soon!
July 8, 2014|Fancy place with good food & drinks|5|I had oysters, a strawberry gazpacho, and a flat iron steak. All were pretty good. The drink menu and atmosphere take this restaurant to the next level though.
June 28, 2014|Spare the attitude|4|Honestly, I'm too damn old to worry about impressing people anymore. Therefore, I thoroughly enjoyed my entire experience at The Dorrance. The restaurant's architecture is breathtaking and the location is convenient to other Providence attractions. The wine and beer selection is ample and the cocktail creative. The food selection was local and varied and don't leave without tasting the chocolate Pot de creme. However, the most impressive feature of all was the hospitality and customer service. No pretence just an overall lovely experience.
June 17, 2014|Never disappointing!|5|My spouse and I love this place! We always choose it for celebratory dinners, one of our anniversaries this time. The pretzel rolls were delicious, as was the crispy cauliflower appetizer. We were totally satisfied, indeed entranced, with the scallops (my spouse) and the tiny, delicate gnocchi (me). We didn't really need the Chocolate Pot au Creme, but who could resist! Wine and prosecco accompanied this fabulous meal. All of this was fantastically enhanced by the professionalism and warmth of our server, David. He is a gem!!
June 14, 2014|Excellent dinner|5|We started with the charcuterie and really liked it--different! We asked the waiter if the chef could make an entree out of the soft shell crab appetizer. We both love soft shell crabs. He created the dish on the fly and they were served with excellent gnocchi and a great mixture of vegetables. Thanks, Nathan! Please keep the volume of the music low when people are dining.
June 14, 2014|Wonderful once again!|5|We have been back several times and never dissapointed. Had a wonderful 35th wedding anniversary dinner. I was impressed to see that they are now labeling gluten free items on the menu and have added a bar menu too. I had local oysters, also new from our last visit. Followed by the Chicken Three Ways with coconut rice. Excellent! Drink menu is nice and with the new bar menu will also consider coming back for just a drink and snack on a Waterfire night.
June 7, 2014|food top notch but scene was off|4|"Went Sat night and the restaurant was very nicely decorated down to the fancy moldings and stain glass. The evening would have been perfect if not for the beach boys cover band blasting away inside the restaurant. They were so loud you couldn't hear the person speaking across the table from you. I understand it's Sat night but for one of Bon Appetit's ""50"" best restaurants you would expect a more romantic ambience. The food was unbelievable though and the service was great. I had the flank steak with marrow and my wife had the pork chop. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and flavorful! I would certainly recommend going there just be prepared for a loud evening or it may have just been a one off as it was our first time there"
June 7, 2014|excellent in fine dining|5|Excellent in fine dining, I will be returning soon
May 31, 2014|Great|5|Chicken is a great entree. Chocolate pot de creme was so yummy. Grilled octopus was not to my liking. Service was exceptional.
May 31, 2014|Perfection|5|We needed a night out. There was 8 of us and we were in our own closed off room. Philip was fantastic, he took great care of us. Food and drinks were exceptional. Perfect for a special occasion. Portions are gourmet sized, allowing for a full appetizer - dessert experience. There's nothing I would have changed.
May 28, 2014|drinks shine, food excellent|4|Drinks were amazing, their cocktails are some of the best around. Food was excellent, not overwhelming in flavor but many more subtle notes.
May 25, 2014|Elegant dining|5|This was a rare Sunday evening dining night at Dorrance since they are usually closed. The interior facilities are superb from the bar decor to the marble flooring. Our waiter David was experienced and familiar with the bar offerings, the wines and excellent at describing and recommending all menu items. Our cocktails, appetizers, meals and the shared dessert were all perfectly prepared and seasoned, elegantly served, substantial and came as described. We will be returning at our first opportunity.
May 25, 2014|Outstanding|5|My family and I went there for a graduation celebration dinner. We love good food and ordered appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts. The cauliflower appetizer was especially tasty as was the chicken three ways and the duck. Big shout out to the bartenders who make incredible unique drinks. The table service was also excellent and the setting is a beautiful 100 year old bank building. Am looking forward to returning soon!
May 24, 2014|Not what it was|1|When last I was at the Dorrance in August 2013 the food was sensational, inventive and service top notch. Everything that the restaurant is not know. The service was lack luster, impersonal and perfunctory. The food was a mess at best. I had the curried cauliflower, because the description in the menu sounded like it was inventive, instead it just reeked, and left a bilious after taste of mint. The main course was scallops on couscous. The scallops were well done, but the gruel like substance they rested on was something that should have remained in Oliver Twist. The fact that the waiter insisted we order desert at the beginning of the meal, should be a WARNING to one and all. Go for the BAR not for the lousy food.
May 21, 2014|Great find|5|Celebrated our wedding anniversary before a concert at the Dorrance midweek so it was very quiet. Service very good - we were taken care of by a self identified new waiter but he was very well supervised. Food and service met our expectations in a very romantic setting.
May 10, 2014|Beautiful, but small portions |4|"There is no more beautiful place in Providence than The Dorrance-the drinks and service are fantastic and it is a feast for the eyes. The food is fantastic-but the portions are way too small. When my entrée came, I said to the waiter ""maybe I should have ordered two.""...it was appetizer size. The dessert portions could be eaten in 3 bites. In short; fantastic, but portions too small, and should be increased by at least a third."
May 10, 2014|Pre-show dinner|4|Service was excellent, our waiter Celal was always there but without hovering or being obtrusive. The food was very interesting and well prepared. All in all, an experience worth repeating. The Dorrance is a 3 minute walk to the Providence Theater, very convenient.
May 10, 2014|Mothers Day at The Dorrance|3|The quality and quantity of food is not worth the expensive prices you pay for them. My sirloin was $32 for a very small thin piece of steak filled with grizzle and fat. One sister ordered the black pasta dish which turned out to be 'chocolate cocoa' flavored pasta in a lemon sauce-yuck. My other sister ordered the pork chop, which was a good size and thickness, just dangerously undercooked. My mother had the duck which she claimed was fine but I think she was just being polite because we were paying. Atmosphere was elegant in restaurant, but the bathrooms were horrible. Very dirty and very sticky floors with old fixtures, low toilet positioned so your knees hit the wall, and a musty locker room odor.
April 23, 2014|Back to top?|5|After the highly creative Ben Sukle's departure in early 2013, Massimilano Mariotta took over, with equal creativity and grand plans for The Dorrance. For whatever reason, he left late 2013, and The Dorrance hit a bit of a rough patch, in which the owners couldn't commit to an executive chef, and it showed in the food's inconsistency. Fortunately there is a new Executive chef, and the early results are extremely promising. Creativity at its best — trying to impress not with fancy descriptions or just fancy plating but with novel combinations of ingredients and flavors that make for new and beautifully complex experiences. There is still room to improve (e.g., desserts), but The Dorrence is back among Providence's top restaurants.
April 12, 2014|Lackluster|3|Dorrance great open room and ambiance, waiter was spot on, Food not so much. Fluke undercooked, pork chop overcooked. Overheated restaurant. Fantastic bar stall
April 11, 2014|Date night|4|We went for an extremely early dinner, so it was pretty quiet. The service was great. The cocktails were awesome. I had the pea appetizer it was very refreshing and the chicken three ways which was delicious. My partner had the curried cauliflower appetizer which she thought was alright and ordered a special made vegetarian dish. That was a risotto which needed more seasoning. I am a bit more of a foodie than my partner and I love The Dorrance. She enjoyed the evening and would go back.
April 5, 2014|ambience|5|Waiter and bartenders outstanding Food while excellent definitely pricey for portions but of high quality would definitely go back and make trip from Boston because we loved look and feel of the place
March 22, 2014|Amazing|5|Reading reviews definitely pays off - The Dorrance was an absolutely wonderful experience. The room was elegant. The menu inventive but still accessible. The staff was everything staff should be - knowledgeable and friendly without being intrusive. And, of course, the food was outstanding. It was well worth the drive from Boston and a lovely, lovely evening.
March 8, 2014|Not as good as last time...|4|A great place for dinner, although slightly disappointed as it was not as good as our first time. Long waits for bread when we arrived and also between courses. Menu, food, and location in the former Fed Building still combine to make this a great restaurant.
March 8, 2014|Elegant New England Dining|5|The Dorrance is an exciting restaurant with wonderfully prepared, sophisticated dishes made from local products. The setting is impressive and carefully designed, the staff is enthusiastic and attentive and the food is superb.
March 8, 2014|Another great Providence eatery|4|The building is amazing with stained glass windows, 20 foot plaster ceilings, just a fabulous atmosphere. Service was friendly yet not nosy, the waiter even went looking for a black napkin when my wife expressed concern that the white would leave lint. He returned to assure her that the owner stated that all napkins were lint free and not to worry (and he was correct ). The food was excellent, local scallops for my wife while I enjoyed a perfectly cooked duck breast. Portions were nice, with a tomato bisque for an appetizer and the duck entree I had just enough room for a - to die for- chocolate creme dessert and a wonderful espresso.
March 6, 2014|Amazing waiter and food|5|Wonderful meal and drinks and service. We had duck, the perch special and red wine pasta, all of which were excellent. Carpaccio was unimpressive but roasted tomato soup and chicken wings were great. Their Manhattans are delicious.
March 4, 2014|Delightful Dining|5|Excellent friendly service, delicious food, and an overall delightful dining experience
March 1, 2014|Nice Evening|5|As a party of two, we arrived about a half hour early with res. @ 7:30 and sat at the bar for a couple drinks. Valet parking available. Food was available at the bar but we decided to wait for our table and watched the bartenders shaking drink after drink and they all were good and really worked hard. A party in the next room was a little loud but not overly distracting. They have a limited menu that changes slightly but we had no problem finding something we would like. The Scallops were spot on as was the Orange Perch which was cooked to perfection. The portions were fair but don't expect a plate full. We finished our meal with cobbler and coffee and were not rushed at all. A very nice spot which we will definitely visit many more times.
February 28, 2014|Outstanding time|5|My wife and I took another couple to The Dorrance because they have always been critical to many places we have gone in the past. They were blown away by the food, service and ambiance. An example: The ordered appetizer was not what my friend thought it would be...immediately the waitress (Caitlin I believe) had it adjusted to suit her wishes. This restaurant goes above and beyond to please every guest and satisfy every taste.
February 25, 2014|Very Metropolitian|5|A city dwellers delight. Located in the heart of the capital city; formerly the Federal Reserve. Diners are exposed to fine food & drink in a gilded age setting. Exquisite!
February 21, 2014|Excellent except the martini...|5|Service and food were excellent and I recommend this establishment highly. However, don't order a martini. I ordered one very dry (and I stressed VERY dry), and I got one with too much vermouth in a champagne coupe style glass - what's up with that? Heck, I don't like them for champagne, either. To add insult to injury (we martini drinkers take our beverage seriously, you know), it was perhaps the smallest martini I have ever been offered at a restaurant or bar. I almost wanted to check who the bartender was to see if he or she was just messin' with me, or what. Again, other than that, the meal and service were excellent and my wife and I will return there. But I won't order a martini.
February 14, 2014|A must do|5|This restaurant is so gorgeous inside, I've never seen anything like it except in movies. The food is delicious, tables have plenty of room between them so you can feel comfortable that no ones overhearing your romantic conversation. We started dinner at 8 and despite all try tables being full it was quite quiet. By the time we left at 11 the bar area was full and a live jazz band had started, adding to the atmosphere. Highly recommended!
February 8, 2014|Lovely!|5|Don't let the menu scare you. The food was outstanding. From salad, to the duck and on to desert (cheese cake a new way) it was a taste treat. For your next special treat...a must try!
February 6, 2014|great service; not so great food|3|The duck was very undercooked, near raw. Tiny glasses of wine. Service was excellent, as was the quiet atmosphere, but it was nearly empty.
February 1, 2014|Dorrance a fine dining destination|5|We chose The Dorrance for dinner after a flight home. It is a wonderful restaurant with great, imaginative food, attentive service, and a good wine list. We had perfect oysters on the half-shell with an excellent pear vinaigrette sauce (they were wonderful unsauced), a rabbit ragout, and perfectly cooked tenderloin with roasted winter vegetables. We will certainly go back and will recommend it without hesitation.
January 30, 2014|An Upscale Gem|5|Located in the grand lobby of a former bank building, the Dorrance is a fine restaurant in a beautiful setting. The staff is courteous and professional. The food is terrific. This is a great place to celebrate special occasions or just to go for a fine dining experience.
January 25, 2014|Many drinks to pick from.|4|Many drinks to pick from. Price on the high side for Providence. Sixteen dollars for a small martini. Food was very good. Noise was very loud. Wedding on the upper level was making a lot of noise. Worth a trip if only to enjoy the beautiful building.
Dined on January 22, 2014|Good, but empty|4|The Dorrance is a lovely setting and the meal I enjoyed was delicious. Too bad there were no other diners on a Wednesday night. There were a handful of folks in the bar and it seems like that is their best attribute - good cocktails and a unique building.
January 17, 2014|The Dorrance has it|5|"My wife and I decided to dine at The Dorrance, remembering that the building was once our bank, before it closed in a major RI banking scandal in the early 1990's. Thought we'd exorcise the place. And it turned out great--the reception was warm and inviting, the room is still spectacular, although a bit cavernous, and the service and food were top-notch. Oysters were briny, fresh and clean, the squid ""frites"" were delicious and fun. Main courses--chicken three ways and the pork chop were managed perfectly, all with sides that truly complemented the mains. Freshness, simplicity, and abundance. Our waiter was charming, witty and very, very attentive, without ever being overbearing. We will look forward to coming again."
January 11, 2014|Beautiful old building, great|4|Beautiful old building, great service, fantastic drink menu and wonderful food
January 3, 2014|Excellent Service|5|From the time I walked in to the restaurant, I felt as if it was warm and inviting. The waitress we had was so personable that it was a welcome reprieve. She was such a delight that I enjoyed her company. She was very knowledgeable about the food, wine, and drinks that any restaurant would scoop her up and take her away. I enjoyed every minute of my residents ime at the Dorrance because of her.
December 28, 2013|Unique setting|4|We liked the atmosphere. The food was very good. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. Drinks were creative. We will be back.
December 28, 2013|Excellent dining experience.|5|Excellent dining experience. From the service to ambience to the food - it was outstanding.
December 21, 2013|Lovely Dining Experience|3|The cocktails were outstanding, duck and dish delicious, and the blackberry cobbler among the best desserts I've had in a while. The wait was often slow-- we had reservations and still had to wait 15 minutes for our table, and each course took a long time to come out (even though the service was very friendly and responsive). Other than the long waits though, a fantastic dinner and gorgeous ambience!
December 14, 2013|Would definately go again|5|Impressed by the food, friendly service, and atmosphere
December 6, 2013|Perfect date spot|5|I booked a reservation at The Dorrance for a little Christmas get together with some of the guys at work and the wives. The table was ready right away and they didn't mind holding off until our whole party was present. The drinks were perfect, eclectic and rich in local spirits. I highly recommend the smoking gun a twist on a manhattan with tobacco bitters served in a rocks glass and an ashtray( my kind of drink). The food was amazing. The waiter top notch, personable and humorous. The architecture was breathtaking and just added to the already perfect evening. I would highly recommend this resturant for any special occasion, date night or nice night out on the town.. Well done
December 4, 2013|Best you'll ever have|5|If amazing service, food, drink and atmosphere is what you enjoy then this is definitely the place! The Dorrance is a perfect place to go with a group of people, friends or a date. The bar was absolutely amazing along with the drinks, the up & cucumber was light and refreshing. My date and I basically ordered everything on the menu and started arguing about what one was the best. Needless to say, it was the best food I've ever had. Picking the food and drink choices were easy because our waiter knew every drink and food so well and was able to describe and recommend according to what I've said I liked. Unbelievable experience, everyone must go! Every night is a the night to be at the Dorrance!
November 30, 2013|The food was amazing and the|5|The food was amazing and the building is beautiful!!
November 9, 2013|Great Ambiance & Service|4|A beautiful building with great ambiance...but a little loud for dinner conversation. The service was exceptional....which is not common in Providence.
November 8, 2013|Fine Dining and Cocktail Experience|5|Great Providence downtown location, ambiance, romantic setting, outstanding cuisine choices and most selection of excellent cocktails. Best choice to dine and have after hours cocktails. Bartenders are awesome!!!
November 8, 2013|Delicious|4|The food was really flawless in taste and presentation. Every single dish was delicious and beautiful without being ostentatious. The space is stunning, though a little cavernous. Our server was helpful without being intrusive.
October 26, 2013|Outstanding on every count|5|The entire experience was perfect. Excellent service, exquisite food and an excecptional environment. Beautiful. Thank you!
October 18, 2013|A Providence Gem|5|Excellent food, attentive and friendly wait staff ... i only wish the 3 piece band wasn't so loud when they started playing at about 10 pm .... those glorious high ceilings made it hard to converse. Definitely would dine here again!
October 18, 2013|Happy conference group|4|The food was excellently prepared by the new chef Massimo. Several of us had sea scallops which were wonderfully prepared in a light sauce that didn't hide but enhanced the very fresh seafood. Another had the duck which she also said was excellent. Two men had the beef; they were a bit underwhelmed by that entree. The chocolate mousse was just the right sweet bitter combo accompanied by cantaloupe sorbet. The co-owner Regina happily accommodated us when I called early in the day of the date of our dinner to ask whether we could expand the group from 8 to 10. We actually arrived with one more (11) and the hostess happily added another seat. The Dorrance is well worth visiting.
October 4, 2013|Unbelieveably beautiful restaurant,|5|Unbelieveably beautiful restaurant, in an historic bank. The food is delicious and very gourmet. This is one of the best restaurants in Providence.
October 2, 2013|wonderful experience|5|In addition to the amazing food and wine, my server gave me a tour of the beautiful historic venue.
September 28, 2013|Seasonal Favorite|5|We visited the Dorrance on the Providence Foodie Tour and decided to return for dinner. The chef has a farm where he grows his own vegetables and herbs and the flavors that he puts together are amazing. The menu is obviously seasonal, so I won't comment on a particular dish. Suffice it to say that it is a true dining experience.
September 26, 2013|5 stars every time!!!|5|We have been here multiple times and are NEVER dissapointed. The food is amazing and creative. If you are looking for the ordinary stay away but if you want an interesting dining experience in a beautiful setting with incredible service this is the place for you. I loved that the chef came to our table and that there was no problem subsitutuing sides for my gluten free needs. For starters I had the roasted beet salad which was excellent and liked that they used orange and red beets because the flavors are different. I had the duck which was so tender and moist. My husband had braised beef for his antree and the lemon tart for dessert. Both excellent.
September 20, 2013|Massimiliano is one chef on his way|5|When a chef stops by your table three times during the leisurely dining experience, you know he cares about the food. It shows. My duck was tender and the fig cocktail was interesting and satisfying. My husband equally enjoyed his fish and we both loved our desserts. Too bad I didn't take a picture since the presentations were picture perfect, but I was enjoying the beautiful restaurant and the chats with the waiters and the chef. Praise enough? It is conveniently located in the historic downtown area. Make a reservation and go.
September 18, 2013|History and good food|5|Met a friend for drinks and dinner here. The food was good - portion sizes were smaller, but satisfying. Well presented food and beautiful ambiance - old Federal Reserve building nicely restored. The drink prices were high - and I felt like the value for the money was not there. I'd return, but not regularly
September 6, 2013|Really, really good|5|The food was delicious. The staff were friendly, personable, and professional. The ambient (perhaps the most striking part of an overall excellent restaurant) is a beautiful, lavishly decorated, high-ceilinged room in downtown Providence. A great date spot or place to bring someone you'd like to impress :)
September 5, 2013|Food and Atmosphere - excellent|5|The different butter combinations are outstanding. The oysters were delectable and the entrees were superb. We had the duck with spaetzle, the Brasato, the sirloin and the Pt Judith Day Boat Fish. All were equally excellent. The amuse bouche being outstanding. We had a small refresher between course of elderberry sorbet. Incredibly innovative and delicious. Our water was attentive. We love the atmosphere because of its elegance. The chef came to our table and explained the food concept as well as enhancing our dining experience with stories of events to come including the new restaurant being created in the upstairs lobby where raclete and swiss fondue will be served. Yum! Can't wait to return. Our guest enjoyed the experience.
August 24, 2013|service was excellent. Food|4|service was excellent. Food and presentation lovely. Portions a bit small but rich in flavors. Lovely atmosphere. Executive Chief came out to the table and introduced our appetizers. Nice touch
July 30, 2013|Outstanding!|5|We celebrated a double anniversary at the Dorrance and the 4 of us all agree it was a memorable evening thanks to the great service and amazing meal. Every aspect of the meal and service were first rate. Of all the favors the most memorable was the corn creme brûlée. It was the perfect end to a carefully prepared and delicious meal.
July 27, 2013|A very nice experience|5|First time dining at The Dorrance, it is a beautifully detailed space worth going into just to appreciate the architecture. The food was very good and the service was terrific. I plan on returning.
July 23, 2013|This is it!|5|WOW, was this place amazing. The old bank as a backdrop acts as a perfect scene for gastronomic pleasure. Almost everything we had from the tiny little pre-meal teaser to our desserts were spectacular. Combinatons of textures and tastes that tickled our tounges and made us swoon with delight. I would definitely place this restaurant on the top 10 in Providence or the US. If you are reading this, stop! Just make the reservation and go...you will not be disapointed. Oh, one exception...dont order the free range chicken. It wasnt bad but compared to the other dishes it was truly disapointing.
July 19, 2013|Magical Night.|5|This was an amazing restaurant that gave 2 foodies a night to remember. From the Owner, the staff and the Chef came memorable and delicious food. Everyone made us feel like we were part of their family. We can't wait to go back and bring our friends.
July 13, 2013|Great time at the Dorrance|4|We decided to check out the Dorrance for restuarant week and had a great time. The service was spectacular, however be prepared for a dining experience (our whole meal took about 2 hours). Our waiter was very helpful with suggestions. He even brough us Coozies with our beer! The portions were smaller than expected but there was still plenty to eat (for me anyhow, my boyfriend could used a little more food). Overall we had a great time and will be back but we'll probably save this for a special occasion next time!
July 12, 2013|New Chef: Even Better!|5|I was planning a birthday dinner and she LOVED the tasting menu we had on Valentine's Day here. When I saw that the chef had changed since then, and that the tasting menu was not listed anymore, I was nervous. I called the Dorrance the day prior and they assured me that they still prepared tasing menus. We went and it was a fantsatic experience! The chef came to our table throughout our meal to explain the concepts of certain dishes, solicit our feedback, hunger level and protein choices. Our server, David, selected the wine and cocktail pairings perfectly (I would recommend NOT drinking every drink served if you want to avoid being wobbly when you leave). Every dish was excellent from our amuse bouche to our dessert. Tremendous!
July 9, 2013|Beautiful place and very good food|4|We had a very nice meal at the Dorrance. The place is lovely, and the food is quite good. The scallops one of us ordered were the best, but the fish of the day was also good. Our waiter was wonderful, although there was an unusually long pause between appetizer and entrees. Probably not his fault. It was a birthday dinner, and they served nice treats at the end. I recommend it.
June 8, 2013|New chef, Awesome food|5|The Dorrance had the reputation already to be a good restaurant with great food already. we went there a couple of time to either enjoy one of their fantastic cocktail creation or to dine. the location is beautiful and the service is amazing. but this last time we went, the food was a step up. from Starter to dessert, it was very delicate and subtil. and there we found out they have a new chef, originally from Switzerland, whom work in places like Shanghai, Zurich, and New-York before coming to the Dorrance. so I think I quite found my new favorite restaurant in Providence!
June 7, 2013|Outstanding! Welcome Chef Mariotta!|5|New Chef at The Dorrance. Creative European style. I had the Scallop Mattapoisett and the house made pasta. Warm chocolate chip cookies and house made sorbet with our coffee. Divine, not to be missed!
May 18, 2013|A Surprising Gem|5|As our third choice restaurant for the evening, we expected a good meal but nothing over the top amazing. We were wrong. Every.single.bite was perfect. The drinks were well crafted and got our night off to a great start. The braised veal was melt in your mouth perfect, and each bite of beef was so tender that even the butter knife was more than what I needed. I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a nice evening out, whether to celebrate or to just enjoy a really amazing meal!!
May 17, 2013|Mix up at the Dorrance|3|When making the reservation I wrote vegetarian in the comment section, they never mentioned a thing about it. The menu only had one entree listed on it that did not contain meat, which was supposedly an asparagus risotto. When it arrived at the table though it had scallops on top of it and was made with chicken stock. It ends up that it was printed wrong on the menu, instead of asparagus it was supposed to say scallops. The food runner that brought the dish out though made out as if we were crazy for thinking that it didn't say scallops on the menu. They took it back and gave me a potato pancake with a fried egg on top, which was not only unseasoned but they charged me $20 for. Other than that, the service was incredibly slow.
May 1, 2013|Wow! A Proividence Gem|5|I searched for a restaurant to go to before a concert, and found The Dorrance mentioned in a New York Times article. Am I glad that I found it! Awesome cocktails and a delicious, creative menu. The restaurant is housed in a old bank, with large windows and beautiful detail. I live in Boston, and I would drive the 45 minutes or so it takes to get there just to have dinner at The Dorrance.
April 23, 2013|Spectacular|5|Spectacular building, beautiful dining room, and friendly staff. The blind tasting menu was exciting and did not disappoint. And the service was the outstanding. Jon, our server, was the perfect combination of unintrusive, knowledgable, efficient, and entertaining. An extraordinary dining experience all around.

Dined on March 30, 2013|We had the six course tasting|5|We had the six course tasting menu. Starting with 3 small snacks. I loved the crab salad with toasted seeds wrapped in daikon with orange zest and then Cerviche with fluke and parsnips, a soup with roasted celeriac and Parmesan broth, tile fish ringed with mustard greens and cauliflower and sirloin. The deserts were a special carrot cake and panacotta with oat chips and celery granita. Our server Caitlin was excellent. She explained all the courses and answered all our questions. She was our server the last time and is a real asset to this restaurant. This chef is extremely creative and does an excellent job.
March 29, 2013|Outstanding Drinks, Food, Service|4|"The Dorrance was perfect for our needs. I wanted an unusual spot with ""fancy"" decor and great food, that would be special for my wife's birthday. This place fit the bill perfectly. The drinks were incredibly good, and changed my mind about how interesting and delicious a cocktail could be. I haven't stopped telling people about the ""Kentucky Campfire"" bourbon cocktails I had, and I've already tried to duplicate it at home (without success). All 4 in our group LOVED our apps and dinners. The desert couldn't measure up to the rest of the meal in my opinion. I would have had another cocktail instead, had I known. As it was, our waiter surprised us all with a complimentary birthday drink, in honor of my sweetheart, and it was terrific."
March 29, 2013|Well prepared food but small|3|Well prepared food but small portions and only five entree choices. Wine list of perhaps 70 bottles but only European wines.
March 16, 2013|Not Impressed|2|I was very disappointed with The Dorrance. I had read good things, but was not impressed at all. The good portions were very small, which I would have been fine with, except they were not very good. The cocktails were good, but I wasn't that impressed with them either. On top of all that, everything was very expensive and the ambiance was poor. The reataurant was half empty and it seemed to be a much older crowd. The service however was very good. For the amount of money we spent, we could have definitely gotten a much better meal at another restaurant.

March 9, 2013|Great experience at the Dorrance.|4|Great experience at the Dorrance. I can't wait to go back and bring all of my friends.
March 9, 2013|Ordered some appetizers and|3|Ordered some appetizers and entrees to share as none of us were very hungry. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. We ordered some specialty cocktails which were light and refreshing. The appetizers and entrees were all good and the portion size was just right, given our limited appetites that night. The best part was hands down the pretzel bread! They were served warm and fluffy on the inside! Only negative was when we asled for more bread, the waiter didn't tell us it would cost money - only $3 a roll which we gladly paid, however would be nice to know ahead of time next time of the fees associated with it. Overall, good experience and would come back to try out more dishes from the menu.
March 8, 2013|The decor at the Dorrance|5|The decor at the Dorrance was awesome especially the stained glass windows. We absolutely enjoyed every course of the tasting with the wine pairings. Our waitress was knowledgable about the food and drink menu and was attentive to us throughout the meal. Of all the good restaurants in Providence we would certainly rank The Dorrance high on our list of favorites.
March 7, 2013|Dining at the Dorrance was|5|Dining at the Dorrance was an absolutely unforgettable experience. My party and I did the six course tasting menu with courses and snacks that were beautifully plated and as appealing to the eyes as it was to the palate. Everything from the appetizer courses, with dishes such as coffee roasted beets, to an amazing peruvian ceviche, perfectly cooked sirloin, and the most mouth watering and artistically crafted desserts, there was not a single dish which disappointed. The environment itself was elegant, and luxurious, and the service was unmatched. Our server, David, was knowledgable and friendly and was an irreplaceable part of our dining experience, as was the entire staff. We shall be dining here again!
March 5, 2013|Best of Providence|5|You must try The Dorrance. Perfect for foo-foo-foodies. Recently At a top ten Fremch restaurant in NYC. It has nothing on The Dorrance. Best duck I have had anywhere. Tile fish cooked to perfection. Fantastic cocktails!
March 5, 2013|This was wonderful. Great|5|This was wonderful. Great dinner, great service. The staff enjoys their jobs and it shows. What a great evening!!!
March 1, 2013|Downtown Destination for Foodies|5|The chef's tasting menu was creative and outstanding. Even though one at our table didn't eat red meat, the chef seemed to instantly concoct a meal centered around seafood. Some of the dishes were magical, including the grilled cohog. So delicious.
February 26, 2013|AAA+++|5|I have been living in Providence for 23 years, & must say that the Dorrance has been the greatest dining experience I've ever had in here in the Capital City, hands down.
February 15, 2013|Great food, great service.|5|Great food, great service. Loved the tasting menu - fun & the 4 course was just the right amount of food. Cocktails were fab too.
February 14, 2013|awesome cocktail list|4|Had a great Valentine's day dinner, Heidi was a superb server. Food was very original but the cocktails steal the show ... the ex bank makes a wonderful space, music was good as well.

January 12, 2013|Great food lost in the crowd|2|"Our table of 4 decided to order the 6-course Tasting Menu with wine pairings. The food was impeccable - creative, surprising, beautiful, and delicious. The wine pairings were wonderfully well selected. The cocktails (for which The Dorrance generates a great deal of buzz) were terrific. The Dorrance had booked TWO holiday parties on the night we visited. After our 1st course, things came to a standstill. The entire staff was friendly and attentive and our server apologized (many times as the evening continued, though we never complained) ""for the wait"" and seemed to pour our wine a bit more generously to make up for it. We went to get great food...and we did! Unfortunately, the overbooked, deafening venue made it difficult to enjoy."
January 5, 2013|I thought the food and service|4|I thought the food and service was very good. Plate presentations where decorative but the portion sizes had much to be desired. Left hungry and went to another restaurant for an after dinner cheese plate.
January 3, 2013|Tasting menu was just okay.|3|Tasting menu was just okay. I enjoyed it but it was a bit uneven. One dish was shockingly salty. Still, overall an enjoyable experience and I'm willing to give it another go sometime.
December 28, 2012|Don't wait for a special occasion -|5|If you are looking for a special place that will offer fantastic and innovative food, an intelligently paired wine list, attentive service professionals, interesting craft cocktails in an interesting venue, look no further than the Dorrance. We had the 4-course tasting menu, paired with wines. Highly recommend this to anyone. Next time, we will plan ahead with just a little more time and indulge in the 6 or even 8-course tasting menu. Every dish was spot on with flavor, presentation, and size. This night was a special occasion for us, but I think a meal at the Dorrance will make any night memorable.
December 22, 2012|Best restaurant in Providence|5|Tasting menu was fantastic. Service was attentive The only problem was the music was so loud we had to keep asking the server to repeat herself as she described the dishes. Also it was very cold I wore my winter coat during the whole meal.
December 22, 2012|Beautiful place. Very nice|4|Beautiful place. Very nice service. So so pretentious food. Also, while the building itself is gorgeous, the tables, chairs and other decor of the restaurant were surprisingly and disappointingly cheap. Still, great fun, great atmosphere.
December 22, 2012|Excellent first courses and|4|Excellent first courses and desserts. Also, very good drinks, which were creative revisions to classics (Manhattan and Bond Martini). Main courses also quite good, though not as 'creative' as first courses and desserts. Beautiful restaurant setting (former Federal Reserve building) with good use of public space. Reasaonable prices. Overall, a very high quality dining experience.
December 8, 2012|The food and service were|5|The food and service were outstanding, but unfortunately our romantic evening was ruined by a holiday party which was loud and carried throughout the entire restaurant. This included a PA system with all sorts of announcements from the group leader, followed by shouts and screams. It made for a very distressing evening, for which the waiter apologized repeatedly. They should have closed the restaurant to the general public.
December 8, 2012|Loved the Dorrance!!!|5|We LOVED Dorrance, even though there was a VERY noisy holiday party going on in the other side of the restaurant. The food was fabulous, the atmosphere exquisite and the tables so nicely spaced out. It was a family dinner and we were able to enjoy each other's company and conversation. The waiter was extremely pleasant and helpful. I will definitely come back when visiting my daughter in Providence!
December 8, 2012|Excellent meal, very creative|4|Excellent meal, very creative with appropriate portions. Nicely done. Cocktails are excellent, there is no end to the creativity.
November 24, 2012|Disappointing - at best|2|This restaurant is truly a study in contradictions. The most exceptional feature is the stunning decor from a glorious bygone era. The bar scene was extremely loud on Saturday evening. Seemed to be a 'pick-up' atmosphere. Not what one would expect from a fine dining establishment. The menu looked to be a showcase of chef talents, with a few too many componenets in each dish - fussy and complex - nothing was really extraordinary. We were surprised to discover upon paying the bill that the 'special' (a steak) was double the price of all entrees on the menu. With so many choices in the Providence dining arena offering suberb food and service, it is hard to think about going back to the Dorrance.
November 24, 2012|We made reservations for 7:30|5|We made reservations for 7:30 in order to see/hear the Sinatra Tribute band, though we didn't realize that the band would not start playing until 10. We explained this to the waitress (we didn't want to be holding up a table), but she told us that there was no problem. And, in fact, there wasn't, even though, by 9:30, the resataurant was pretty jammed. The menu, though small, if you discount the various tasting menus, was exceedingly imaginative, and the food was delicious. The cocktail menu was as imaginative, and contained many ingredients with which we were not familar (and we drink and dine out frequently). The waitress explained that many of the ingredients are created in-house. Service was excellent...

November 14, 2012|Wonderful food and cheerful|5|Wonderful food and cheerful staff. The decor is gorgeous - when we mentioned it to the waitress she offered to give us a tour after we finished dinner. The old vault door is not to be missed! We tried several of the specialty cocktails and were intrigued and delighted by each one. This bar is perfect for fans of mixology looking to try something new. My fiancé and I agree that this is the best meal we've had together!

October 27, 2012|Dining here is unlike anything|5|Dining here is unlike anything else in Rhode Island. It feels like you've been transported to the scene of one of those fancy cooking sows, but it is so much more. With a focus on local and seasonal ingredients, the Dorrance maintains that farm to table tradition that Rhode Island is known for. The prices on the menu are a steal, too! The architecture and decor is breath-taking. Located in the historic Federal Reserve building, you can walk into the old vault that still smells like money! The bar is fully stocked with the best and lesser known brands, staffed by the cty's bst mixologists and offering unique and special cocktails. Each time here has been as memorable as the last- looking forward to next time.
October 27, 2012|NY in Providence|5|Outstanding in every regard. Wonderful hostess. Waiter was extremely personable and knew the menu like it was his own. Farm fresh foods delivered to your plate with a great presentation. Perfectly cooked foods, with flavors exploding in your mouth. NY like top quality in a great setting in downtown Providence. Portions are on the small size. Suggest you order two magnificent appitzers before main course. Excellent drink and wine list.
October 27, 2012|Best restaurant in Providence!|5|We had a fantastic meal at the Dorrance on Saturday night. The service was excellent and the food was both beautiful and delicious. For appetizers we sampled the ceviche, local mushrooms, and papardelle with duck sausage. We then shared the fluke with jonah crab, stuffed quail, and dry aged (in house) duck breast. For dessert we couldn't decide and just ordered every item offered on the menu. Wow! Everything was made on site, even the warm pretzel bread and butter. Our server Dave was super knowledgeable about every item on every plate...helpful but not over-bearing. The restaurant is an awesome old federal reserve building and was beautifully decorated and surprisingly quiet for such a large open space. Highly recommended!
October 26, 2012|The first courses were sublime,|5|The first courses were sublime, as was the aged duck entrée. I loved the constant bombardment of different flavors and textures. The service was expert and rapid. It is a tad pricey, though.
October 13, 2012|Go-to restaurant in Providence|5|There are some excellent restaurants in Providence, and I've sampled quite a few, but so far this is tops. The drinks are as interesting and artful as you'd find anywhere in the world, and the food from bread to desert was spectacular. The service was perfect. The Dorrance is my Providence go-to restaurant now.
October 3, 2012|Everything was wonderful.|5|Everything was wonderful. The food was fantastic, the service extrememly helpful and pleasant and the cocktails were superior. we had a wonderful time, and can't wait to return.

September 29, 2012|Never again!!|1|We were very disappointed in this restaurant and will never return. It is very overpriced for the very small and tasteles portions of food one is served . We went to the restaurant with high expectations and were not happy about spending good hard earned money. We also went with the intention of hoping to choose it for a retirement party to be attended by 80-100 people. There is no way I would subject all of those guests to such inferior fare.
September 29, 2012|The Dorrance is a very good|5|The Dorrance is a very good restaurant. I would recommend it to everyone. The large room is like a fairy tale. We felt transported back into time. Overall, the meal was one of the best we have had. The ceviche was amazing -tasty and very fresh. The duck was delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked. The desserts were average. We were hoping for a little more chocolate cake with the chocolate ganache. The yogurt/grape dessert was not good. We felt welcomed by the staff from the minute we came through the doorway. The hostesses couldn't have been nicer and the bartender was just great. Our waiter was not as attentive as he should have been and was little rude. But, it didn't affect our enjoyment of the great meal.
September 28, 2012|Service from the whole team|4|"Service from the whole team and not just our server was outstanding and friendly. Food was great. Room was a bit ""cavernous"" and just did not feel that special."
September 22, 2012|Just perfect!|5|Wonderful, expertly prepared food and outstanding service! Overall an outstanding restaurant.
September 22, 2012|This was my first trip to|5|This was my first trip to The Dorrance - but certainly not my last. The food was superb. The menu ranged from slightly more traditional dishes to creative combinations or twists. It was clear that great care went into not only preparation but also presentation. The service was fantastic - pleasant, timely (without being obsequious), and knowledgeable when making recommendations. And the drinks - let us not forget the drinks. I had a Westminster Revival with dinner and an Armada cocktail with dessert. Both had layers of subtle complexity - a different joy to be discovered with each sip. Furthermore, the restaurant makes excellent use of space - making dinner feel private but not isolated. I cannot recommend The Dorrance highly enough.
September 21, 2012|Ate at the bar and watched|5|Ate at the bar and watched delicious cocktails being made constantly. Enjoyed several of the specialty drinks. Loved the Lagostine appetizer and duck. Superior service by Vito at the bar! Can't wait to go back!

September 15, 2012|The Dorrance|5|"One word, ""Flavors"". Two words, ""Artistic Flavors"". The cocktails were amazing and unique. We let our outstanding server, David, recommend all of our food and drinks, We just went along and enjoyed what he brought us."
September 14, 2012|Fantastic, complex food|5|Fantastic, complex food. Perhaps some diners may be put off by the 6-8 components cited for each dish (immaculately described by the lead waiter), but each of the components really contributes to an amazing taste experience. And that is true from appetizers all the way through desserts. The portion sizes are very manageable. The sophistication and creativity of the dishes is matched by the beautifully restored interior of the building and by the wine list, which has several pleasant surprises, some intriguing unknowns, with reasonable prices for this level of restaurant. Also commendable: Wines by the glass are $8-10, rare in top places. Only criticism: it got very loud with live music after 9:30pm on a Friday.
September 8, 2012|Great cocktails but the food|4|Great cocktails but the food was not particularly memorable. Our waiter was very free and struggled to address questions.
August 29, 2012|This was a wonderful experience!|5|This was a wonderful experience! The food, cocktails, and ambiance were excellent! We also enjoyed our waitress, who was able to knowledgeably recommend wine choices and cocktails. This is a must try restaurant!!! The food was creative, delicious, and fun!
August 25, 2012|Don't Bother|1|Our service was horrible and the food was mediocre. I had to send my entree back because it was cold (their solution was to reheat it, not prepare another); ended up canceling the order because my husband had finished his dish before I got mine back. They didn't comp of the meal, even though they asked us to come back and give it another try – we will not be back.
August 17, 2012|Lovely meal well made and|4|Lovely meal well made and served. Nice cocktail list.
August 9, 2012|GO!!!|5|Saw a write up on The Dorrance in the NYT 36 Hours in Providence and made plans for our one night in town. We were so pleased we did and our only regret is that we don't live here or we would go often. Great drinks and bartenders serious about their craft, excellent food including items like dry-aged duck we haven't seen anywhere else, beautiful presentations. Professional servers that know the menu, and willing to offer suggestions. Spectacular space in what used to be the Federal Reserve building downtown. Big values in bar menu. We live in Miami Beach and were on what turned out to be an eating tour around Southern New England, this was our last night and perhaps the best. Strongly hope locals support this place. It is a gem. GO!

August 3, 2012|What a blast! Very good-between|5|What a blast! Very good-between the food and the band that started just before we left-everything was great. We'll definitely be back.
August 2, 2012|Good but Spendy for What you get!|4|The restaurant was decorated beautifully. The food was very good, with very small portions, I felt that for the $$ charged it was a bit pricey. I enjoyed having the smaller portion - so I didn't leave feeling stuffed - but you need to be prepared to spend and have smaller portions. They did have pretzel bread that was to die for - we all wished there was a bakery that sold it as they make it there.
July 31, 2012|Delicious All Around|5|Located in the old Federal Reserve building, the Dorrance was a special treat. The ambiance in this building is wonderful: Amazing high ceilings, a long, centrally located bar and whimsical balcony that overlooks the seating area. The food was wonderful from the pretzel bread all the way through the rhubarb dessert. The menu was not extensive, but everything we tried was prepared perfectly, fresh for the season and portions were the perfect size. We started with a fun summertime cocktail, moved onto wine (there were some interesting choices I hadn't seen before) and finished with coffee and after dinner cocktails. This is definitely a restaurant to which I can't wait to return!
July 24, 2012|The restaurant is gorgeous|5|The restaurant is gorgeous and the food matches the architecture. We have never seen such lovely presentations. Every item, from bread to sweets, were crafted with skill and tasted divine. The soft shelled crab and the dry aged duck were outstanding.

The food is unusual but distinctive and delicious, and the service was excellent. Highly recommended.
July 19, 2012|Building memorable—food not so much|4|The Dorrance restaurant is housed in one of the most strikingly beautiful buildings in Providence. It is worthwhile to go for dinner if only to experience the exceptional craftsmanship of the historic interior. The space is akin to having dinner in Grand Central Station in NYC. However, even considering the immensity of the interior, there is a feeling of dining in an intimate space. The food was average—not great, not terrible. Salad was wilted as if prepared hours before. Both entrees were average, but prices seemed fair. Martini's need a real overhaul. Instead of classic Martini glasses, they were served is squatty small compote looking stemware—and I cannot imagine any relevant bar not stocking Bombay Sapphire Gin.
July 19, 2012|The bar tender was excellent|4|The bar tender was excellent as were the drinks. The service in the dining room started slow, but picked up. The food trumped everything. This is a creative chef who enhances the fresh food with deft. Bravo!
July 17, 2012|This was my first visit, and|5|"This was my first visit, and I definitely will return. The Dorrance is a fabulous restaurant -- food was inventive and excellent, and executed with skill. Service was attentive without being overwhelming, and, best of all, I was not asked if was ""working "" on my dinner. The setting also is terrific. Very attractive. All in all, a fabulous place."
June 29, 2012|A Gem in Providence|5|The food and the service at the Dorrance were amazing. In ordering our entrees, I mentioned to my friend to order what she wanted as it was her birthday. The waitress remembered this and delivered dessert complete with a candle at the end of the meal. Outstanding!!!
June 23, 2012|Though my husband and I dine|4|Though my husband and I dine out frequently, we are not accustomed to a high end restaurant like the Dorrance. This was a gift. The place is beautiful and the servers were professional and very pleasant. The food was very good and the cocktail I had was extraordinary. However, unless money is no object, I would not recommend this for other than a very special occasion. Drinks are very pricey and the dinner menu is very limited. I believe there were basically 5 entrees to choose from. Again, we are not sophisticated diners by any means - so this is not a negative review. It's just not our style!
June 22, 2012|Simple Elegance|5|We have been here many times and will continue to go back. It's simple elegance just makes you want to dress up and linger over the interesting foods and cocktails. As always the chef is more than happy to make a few changes to a dessert or entree for my gluten free needs,
June 21, 2012|There was a party upstairs|3|"There was a party upstairs which made it quite loud despite only a few people in the dining area, the music could have been turned down to make it easier on the diners. One of us liked the entree (scallop appetizer doubled), the other ordered sea bass which was a tiny piece and uninteresting though fresh. Service seemed slow especially considering only a handful of customers downstairs. The meals seem to have a heavy emphasis on aesthetics and ""artisanal"" quality, but to us it was overdone. The food was good but not not exceptional."
June 20, 2012|wonderful - out of the ordinary|5|wonderful - out of the ordinary food and a beautiful location
June 16, 2012|The setting is beautiful,|4|The setting is beautiful, and the wait staff was attentive once we were seated. Though the prices were reasonable, and the food was very good (one of us had pork, and one had duck), I thought the portions were quite small--the waiter admitted as much when we ordered, encouraging us to order an appetizer because the dinners were small. (We did not.) I don't need a huge meal, but we did end up ordering dessert, and we were both still feeling a bit hungry when we left the restaurant. The vegetables that came with the meal were unique and tasty (tiny lovely beets, rhubarb, unusual greens). My sidecar cocktail was excellent--well-prepared with a sugared rim.
June 2, 2012|This is my second time at|5|This is my second time at the Dorrance. Both time each dish was creative and exquisite. The chef composes unusually combinations that are unexpected and very very good. Original and creative and fine cuisine.
May 23, 2012|Cocktails were the Star|5|The food was fantastic, but the real stand-outs were the cocktails. They were very interesting and absolutely incredible.
May 18, 2012|We'd never been to The Dorrance|5|We'd never been to The Dorrance but had read a great review in the Boston Globe, and decided to book it for my son's college graduation dinner. We couldn't have chosen a more perfect spot. The atmosphere was festive without a hint of pretension; the service was attentive and thorough without feeling smothering; the menu was inventive, all sourced locally, and absolutely delicious. I'd recommend it highly for group gatherings - if you're looking for romantic, I'd hit it early before it gets busy. Great bar atmosphere.
May 16, 2012|This was some of the worst|1|This was some of the worst food I have ever eaten. The complicated dishes were creative in presentation, but misguided in flavor an eatability. The waitress could not explain any of the dishes and kept going back to find out how the dishes were prepared, what ingredients were used. The banana custard dessert could not have been worse. The people who were my guests felt the same. We decided on a -5 on a scale of 1 out of 10. As the host, I was actually embarrassed to have brought clients to the restaurant. None of us would recommend this restaurant.
May 5, 2012|I read about the Dorrance|5|I read about the Dorrance in Rhode Island Monthly magazine and we had to try it! It is in a beautiful old building which was originally a bank and the decor is elegant without being stuffy. The staff were very friendly and the service perfect. I started with the duck confit appetizer with potato gnocchi - delicious! For the main course I had the dry aged duck with beets (yes, a lot of duck!) and it was outstanding. Very nice wine selection and inventive desserts. All in all a very nice dining experience. We will be going back!

Some of the leaves were rather dry and even brown. The service was excellent. We also enjoyed the dessert (flour-less chocolate cake) very much. This is a good spot for a special occasion, and lunch was not at all crowded.

April 27, 2012|A bit gimmicky This restaurant|3|A bit gimmicky This restaurant is trying so hard to be unique that it comes off as odd. The room, an old bank lobby, is beautiful but because of its sheer scale, it feels cavernous and unwelcoming. It was half filled on a Friday night. The service was above average and they have valet parking. The menu is small and is plagued with strange flavor combinations. Let me make one point- I LOVE daring cuisine …when it works. This did not work. The flavors were not in balance on any of the 6 dishes that came to our table. (3 entrees and 3 appetizers). While each had interesting points, none came together as a finished product. There was always one flavor that overpowered the dish. Providence needs a restaurant like this. I truly hop
April 24, 2012|First timer at The Dorrance|5|From the time we walked through the door, until we walked out, this Lunch meeting was simply elegant. The food, service and ambiance are currently unequalled in the Downtown Providence neighborhood. The tab was most competitive, in my view, and I cannot recommend highly enough, nor can I wait to return.
April 21, 2012|A M A Z I N G!|5|everything about this place is amazing!!!! Jesse is the best bartender in New England! Staff was very professional and really seemed to enjoy their jobs there. It's a beautiful place to sit with a cocktail and listen to soom live jazz on a Saturday night.
April 21, 2012|Most of the food was very|3|Most of the food was very good, but a few of the plates, like the potato dumplings small plate and duck entree were ridiculously small. Much smaller that the other entrees. even with multiple courses we left unsatisfied.
April 21, 2012|Beautiful room. Historic spot|5|Beautiful room. Historic spot in downtown Providence. Don't miss the Chester French entryway. Portions are a little small but beautifully presented. Only the best ingredients. A memorable evening.
April 17, 2012|What a dining room!|5|Delicious food, beautifully prepared & artfully presented. Can't wait to return.
April 11, 2012|The food is fantastic as are|4|The food is fantastic as are the two wait staff. Sadly they are over stretched for the number of tables and strangely there seem to be a lot of managers / front of house - I counted 4 that did not seem to be adding much.
April 5, 2012|Phenomenal food and service.|5|Phenomenal food and service. Spectacular location although too open to be intimate.
March 24, 2012|Amazing cocktails and interesting|4|"Amazing cocktails and interesting food. The menu is divided into small plates and large plates but in our experience, they were about the same size. Our favorite was the Crispy RI Pork, but when our waiter asked ""Do you really want to know?"" when we asked what was in it, we decided no, we'd just enjoy it. The atmosphere is lovely and would be perfect for private events."
March 23, 2012|A fantastic dinner at the|5|A fantastic dinner at the bar. All small plates, almost everyone, and they were all outstanding. The fresh ingredients and the attention to detail were above and beyond. The food was amazing. It was a secondary pleasure to have a mixologist at the bar making very unique cocktails. Very good, and unique.
March 15, 2012|such a beautiful and elegant|5|such a beautiful and elegant spot-lunch service was friendly and knowledgable but not intrusive-food very creative and layered-looks like a fun place for cocktails
March 10, 2012|The ambiance is great: beautiful|4|"The ambiance is great: beautiful building, great decor, spacious. The service was very good: personable but not obsequious. The ""small plates"" were delicious, the ""larger plates"" - presumably an entree - were wonderful but missed a few ingredients to make it a satisfying meal: some wild rice, a few small boiled potatoes or something like that, with some asparagus, green beans or so to complement the meal and to fill some of the empty space on the plate. And green, we both missed green. The minimalistic approach may be great for ""foodies"", most people in RI want a meal. If this is intentional, it should be explained a bit more clearly on the menu or by the server. By the way, the menu on line is difficult to read."
February 23, 2012|Excellent as usual. Have|5|Excellent as usual. Have been back several times. The crab salad was fabulous and so was my duck. My husband had the steak and said it was so tender he didn't need a steak knife. Very accommodating in adapting one of the desserts for my gluten free needs and my husbands lemon cake was awesome. Mezteca, my favorite drink.
February 23, 2012|Phenomenal! Several of my|5|Phenomenal! Several of my friends had recommended The Dorrance to me, and now I will be recommending it to everyone else.
February 22, 2012|The Dorrance is gorgeous and|4|The Dorrance is gorgeous and worth visiting if only to see its spectacular interior. With a menu focused on local food, the choices change regularly and the menu is somewhat limited. When I dined in late February, the menu included no vegetarian entrees, but the chef created something specially for me. My companions, who dined from the menu, were very satisfied with their meals. Small plates were delicious.
February 18, 2012|Was a great dining experience.|5|Was a great dining experience. Listening to Super Chief Trio after dining extended the enjoyment of our dining experience
February 18, 2012|Very limited menu. Small|2|Very limited menu. Small portions with presentation not consistent to plate size Good drinks. Food not hot
February 18, 2012|Beautiful, historic room.|5|Beautiful, historic room. Excellent food at good prices, if somewhat small portions. Attentive but not invasive service. This is an impressive place to take visitors downtown, either for a full evening or for an excellent pre-show meal before an evening at Trinity Rep or PPAC.
February 17, 2012|We had a most enjoyable dinner|5|We had a most enjoyable dinner Friday evening. We shared an excellent salad and mushroom dish and then enjoyed delicious pork and duck entrees respectively. Dessert was also wonderful. The ambience was great and we were not hurried. Service was attentive. Look forward to going back some day!
February 14, 2012|I would absolutely recommend|5|I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion dinner or a nice night out. Can't wait to go back! I happened to walk by this restaurant and noticed how beautiful it was. So when Valentine's day came around, I just had to try it out. My high expectations were exceeded. The decor was stunning, the service impeccable, the food amazing, and the cocktails...wow!! I'm not a cocktail person, but both mine and my date's (the Mezteca and Westminster Revival) were amazing. The food is all local, so the menu varies, but the mushroom appetizer was delicious. The lobster tail special was good, but the portion was on the small side. The fish plate was even better - taste and size-wise. On the pricey side, but definitely worth it.
February 14, 2012|Wonderful Valentines Day dinner|3|Wonderful Valentines Day dinner spot- However, the ambiance needed a bit more warmth, but otherwise, it was a beautiful building with good, friendly service. I would really like to see the restaurant expand on their small plates options.
February 9, 2012|Fabulous!!|5|This is the third time I ate the Dorrance and I can honestly say it may be the best food in the State of RI. It is incredible and I intend to return many times.
January 27, 2012|Perfection|5|Despite the almost daunting scale of opulence as one enters the environs of the Dorrance, the welcoming warmth of the staff as one crosses the threshold, and the immediate sense of deja vu, envelops, entices, and eases the guest into a sense of comfort combined with wonder. The bar master greets you by name, even if it seems another lifetime ago that you were here. And, the cocktails are equal parts alchemy, nostalgia, and modernity that grabs one's imagination like a Proustian Madeline, under the auspices of master mixologist, Jesse Hedberg. At this point, one's expectations have been elevated, and the fare that follows will exceed the hopes of any gastronome. Chef Ben Sukle's culinary creations have to be experienced: pure genius.
January 27, 2012|Wonderful!!|5|We were totally blown away with the food and service at the Dorrance. The quality, presentation, and service were all excellent!! We will definitely be back!!
January 27, 2012|It was really a lovely setting|4|It was really a lovely setting and our waiter knew all the history & shared it with us.
January 27, 2012|The Dorrance is a great addition|4|The Dorrance is a great addition to the restaurant scene in downtown Providence. The interior is spectacular (ornate), the service is friendly and efficient, and the food was excellent.
January 25, 2012|Beautiful setting- good experience|3|Elegant setting, good wine selections, cocktails were well made. Our service was excellent. If you are vegetarian- be sure you have a conversation with your server about it items that appear to be vegetarian but oh by the way have meat juice or skin in them. The chef is clearly very skilled and very creative. I would like to see more vegetarian friendly menu items. The Dorrance has great potential to do a really nice job with events. The valet parking was appreciated.
January 25, 2012|Fabulous,Fabulous,Fabulous!|5|Fabulous,Fabulous,Fabulous! The menu is limited but both the drinks and the menu were so interesting that was not an issue.
January 20, 2012|A new favorite!|5|Great food, great service, and a beautiful room. Fresh, inventive and delicious cocktails. We tried several dishes and liked them all. The service was excellent. Our server made great suggestions/selections. It's a gorgeous space, but not stuffy. No need to wait for a special occasion to visit! Convenient valet parking.
January 20, 2012|The food was outstanding,|5|The food was outstanding, and the portions were just right.
January 19, 2012|The only reason i left the|4|"The only reason i left the service ""fair"" is because it was pretty slow. However they were getting slammed in restaurant week. They did however do everything possible to apologize and to make it ride, offering free drinks etc. It was much appreciated. I would definitely go back. Food was pretty good, some creativity and execution. Space is beautiful. They just need to get the kinks worked out"
January 14, 2012|Very small and limited menu.|4|Very small and limited menu. However, what we had was OUTSTANDING. My fiance had the young lettuces salad and we split the ceviche. Both were fresh and amazing. I had the roast chicken leg which was served with perfectly cooked potatoes and radishes and included with a rich and butterly sauce. Absolutely amazing. My fiance had the sirloin steak which was the most tender and lean steak I have tasted in a long time. The ambiance was also noteworthy and romantic. Very nice experience.
January 13, 2012|Great food, great service,|4|Great food, great service, fantastic architecture.
January 12, 2012|It's great to see what is|4|It's great to see what is happening in this venerable Providence space. Superb, innovative menu. Wonderful ambiance. A welcome addition to the Providence restaurant scene. We look forwrad to returning again soon.
January 5, 2012|Don't go there if you're hungry|2|"Very very limited menu (5 small plates and 5 large) and of those, 3 were duck or salmon. only one choice for salad, beef or chicken...portions EXTREMELY SMALL. And the bar did not even offer ANY choice for Pinot Grigio.....gave the impression of snobbery in their menu and their attitude. For instance: ""we don't subscribe to the traditional dinner options of entree with vegetable and starch...EVERYTHING is a la carte and pricey."
January 3, 2012|It was the Tuesday after new|5|It was the Tuesday after new year's so we expected the place to be quiet. Everything was delicious - the food was excellent and the drinks were great. The staff was very attentive. We will definitely be back again and again.
December 20, 2011|Love the special drink with|5|Love the special drink with the price fix lunch and also the cocktails
December 14, 2011|too few entree selections|3|too few entree selections and wine list was complicated. My pork was a little dry and bland. Food and drink a little pricey. Service was ok but not spectacular
December 7, 2011|There was an interesting selection|4|There was an interesting selection of small and large plates on the dinner menu. All four of us loved what we ordered. The small plates are, in fact, small--which was fine for me. I ordered two which was the right amount for me. The large plates were well priced--slightly under other local restaurants serving similar food. In a city with many fine restaurants emphasizing local ingredients, The Dorrance is not particularly unique. However, the ambiance is lovely and the food very good. The Dorrance has the potential to rank with other fine restuarants in Providence.
