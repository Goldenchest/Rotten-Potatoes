February 28, 2016|delicious|4|The pizza and the wings here are great. Also the noise level is low at this restaurant which is unexpected for this kind of restaurant and we all liked that.
February 20, 2016|Nice Spot for Pizza and Pre Game Meal|4|We were looking for a spot prior to a PC game and this place was highly rated. It did not disappoint. Other than our app taking a little longer than expected to arrive everything else was solid. Pizza is fresh and cooked just right, service was attentive, and the place has a nice combination of family friendly and upscale tavern feel. If I am in the area I will return.

I had the Lobster Ravioli which was pretty good. Their tomato sauce was delicious. Prices are reasonable, but perhaps slightly high. Overall though, a good experience.
February 14, 2016|Not bad for what you get|4|The food within this restaurant is definitely of a unique Italian style. Some menu items can get a bit pricey, especially for what you get. I got a very basic meal, two entrees and two waters, and left with a $45 bill not including tip. I didn't mind at the time, due to it being Valentine's Day- an occasional splurge for a college student like myself. I went primarily for their amazing stuffed mushrooms, something I have found nowhere else (or at least not nearly as good).
February 14, 2016|Food was great but our table location was terrible|3|"We love the food here but this time We made a reservation and told them that we had a baby and we would like a booth, unfortunately they took us to a booth in front of the kitchen, very noisy and disturbing for the baby, not to mention that they leave the back door of the kitchen open and was very cold for us and the baby in that spot, it was also valentines day and we couldn't even talk to each other. We know that we can't get the ""quiet"" in a restaurant, but less noise would be great and any other booth in the restaurant would be better for a couple with a baby."
February 13, 2016|Dinner Spot or Sports Bar|4|The dining experience was overall very good. I could actually see myself coming here more to have a beer at the bar and watch a sporting event on one of their many TV's.

December 24, 2015|Christmas Eve Dinner|2|"Overall disappointing. The amount portioned out for the number of people per table regarding their ""family style"" cold appetizers was minimal to say the least. Baked stuffed were tiny and did not even look table worthy. Have been there other years for Christmas Eve dinner but this year is the last time."
November 7, 2015|Pizza, different and amazing!|4|We had a group and met at the Fire; the specialty pizza was amazing! The restaurant was quite loud, so we did have to scream, but the waitress was nice and attentive. Overall, two thumbs up!
November 7, 2015|Could have been better|3|Let's start with our waiter who was great. Three of us were seated waiting for two more then gave us time without rushing to place our order. I had the shrimp scampi and it was bland. Thank goodness the garlic olive oil that is served with the bread was still on the table. I used to drizzle that over my pasta to give it more flavor. The rest of the pasta dishes were just okay too. Nothing to get excited over. The pizza looked fantastic on other tables. If we did go back we would order that instead of any other main entree. The one pound meatball for an appetizer was good but you want to have at least six people to share it.
August 14, 2015|Good neighborhood spot|4|When we don't want to go far, we choose The Fire. Both lunch and dinner are consistently good. Warm herbed rolls with roasted garlic olive oil are served when you are seated. There are good wines by the glass, the beer is cold, the service is friendly. You should go!
July 31, 2015|great|4|Good food drinks service. We all had something different. It wad all good .
June 13, 2015|Always good|4|Been here multiple times and never had a bad meal. I suggest making reservations for the weekend because they can get very busy.
June 13, 2015|Ok experience|3|Everything was just ok, except the service which was very slow
May 9, 2015|First Visit|3|Four of us dined at The Fire. Two in our party have been before and recommended it as they can accommodate people with gluten allergies. Food was good, but they were out of many items (anchovies for pizza, veal, stuffed peppers) the night we dined. The waitress was apologetic. Stuffed mushroom appetizer was great, as was the pizza. The person who got the gluten free penne with chicken and broccoli loved it. Wine list is good. All in all, it was good. Pizza seems to be the overall winner. I'd definitely go back for that.
April 26, 2015|Not what we had hoped for|3|We had read such good reviews but this restaurant was less than we hoped for. The service, while friendly, was awful in all other ways. It took too long for someone to greet us, the drinks took forever, the server forgot our salad dressing and then did not bring my husband's wine until he was done with the meal. On top of that, my daughters' meals both came out cold. I would not go back, especially when there are so many delicious Italian restaurants in Providence.
April 5, 2015|Great Experience!|5|We went for Easter brunch in the late morning. Everyone was making sure that we had the most pleasant experience. For a decent price, there was a great selection of foods from French Toast and eggs to Chicken Marsala, mussels and shrimp. The service was excellent and well appreciated. A great choice for the family!

March 27, 2015|Not to happy with my family dinner|3|Sat at the 1st table when you walk in to the left next to the door ..There should be a silencer on the door it SLAMS every time it's shut. So the whole time we heard the door banging.Then a woman sitting behind my husband and daughter was using such loud profanity and my 9 yr kept saying mommy she's a bad lady.Food was good but next time I will demand to sit in the back and ask to be moved immediately if next to a loud obnoxious woman again
March 20, 2015|Excellent!!|4|We visit The Fire about one a month and have so since it opened many years ago. The food and service is always very good. They make excellent pizza's as well as many other entrees. I especially like the brick oven lemon chicken. Hats off to Stephano, who always makes us feel at home!! Try it, you won't be disappointed.
February 28, 2015|Nice for casual dining, good pizza|4|This is a decent restaurant with pleasant staff and it was nice to get a brick oven pizza where you can see the brick oven on your way in. I think it would be a good place for sitting down and takeout. The tables are close, and with louder neighbors you will definitely notice the lack of privacy, but if you want to go out and be social, then it won't be a problem. I wouldn't put it on the scale of Lombardi's in Little Italy, but it was very good. I do give them credit for creative toppings and specialty pizzas. They do have gluten free rolls for burgers and pasta, though that may not be indicated clearly in the menu or online.
February 7, 2015|Family dinner|4|Good food , great service. If you want privacy ask to be seated in the back of the restrauant-away from the door. I do have to say I was disappointed in the Shrimp and Scallpp Special-3 small shrp and 2 avg size scallops...clearly not worth the money but everything else was good. Great pizza!
January 28, 2015|Bday Dinner|4|I went on a Wednesday night after a snow storm. The bar was packed but the place was kind of dead but i think it was due to the weather. All of the food we ordered was good and came out fast. The service was great as well.
December 13, 2014|Great place to meet friends.|4|We were greeted with a friendly smile at the door and seated immediately. A busboy brought water and the waitress took our drink order suggesting an excellent bottle of wine. I ordered the Braised Littlenecks and Beans as an appetizer and a Greek salad as my main course. My husband ordered only a dinner salad. The Littlenecks came and the order was huge. Although this cannot be a complaint, I wish I had known, because I would have started with a small salad and had the littlenecks as the main course. It was uncomfortable because my husband sat waiting for his dinner and felt he had to order a soup while he waited for me to finish. The food was very good, but the little necks could have been spicier. I have had this order at the Providence Oyster Bar before. My only complaint about the restaurant was the closeness of the tables. We were too close to the parties on both sides, we had friendly conversations with each party. I just don't like hearing other people's conversations when I am out for the evening. Overall, it was a nice experience and I would return when meeting a larger group, but not for a quiet couple evening. And by the way, The staff was excellent!
December 5, 2014|Good Local Find|4|good prices, good food, good service accommodating for a large party
November 28, 2014|Unexpect Find|4|Great food, a little pricey. On a strip of Chinese fast food and other unappetizing fare The Fire stands out for delicious plates worthy of a big city. The menu is vast and the portions are overwhelming. From appetizers to mains to desert the food is consistently good. The service is also excellent. This restaurant is well run and the chef and the manager deserve to be acknowledged.
November 8, 2014|expensive|2|Should have stuck with their pizza. I order a cobb salad....barely any bacon or cheese on it....the greens had long stems (hate that). My husbabd order Mediterranean shrimp pasta...small shrimp and barely any sauce on the pasta.
October 27, 2014|Disaster|1|The waitress had little to no knowledge of the drink list. The waitress had a poor attitude. The pizza we had was the same quality as a frozen pizza from the grocery store. We actually had to send it back due to poor quality and taste. I felt that the reviews on this restaurant were very misleading.
October 25, 2014|Good food, menu with a lot of options an...|4|Good food, menu with a lot of options and big portions so good value. Only disappointment was table was right next to waiting area so a bit noisy. Would definitely go again.
October 24, 2014|Perfect for a Friday night!|5|My husband and I visited for the first time last Friday night. Our waiter James, was outstanding! Friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The food was fabulous, so delicious and you certainly get your money's worth. We chatted with the General Manager (Jill?) who was also very warm and friendly and a real promoter of the restaurant, the staff and the owners. We are so looking forward to making the drive back, we are from MA, and trying something new. Our experience was perfection.
October 4, 2014|Great find|4|We were traveling through looking for a place for dinner and found The Fire through Open Table. Food was very good. The portions were huge (easily could have fed two people) with reasonable prices. The server was attentive but never hovered. He was very knowledgable of the menu and had good suggestions.
September 13, 2014|Consistent|4|"I've been to the Fire many times and have never been disappointed. The drinks and food have consistently been delicious ! It's my ""go to ""place when I don't want to think about where to dine!"
September 5, 2014|The Fire review...|4|The Fire... Great name great pizza. Dough n sauce are well made and full of flavor. The 1lb meatball app is worth it alone.....only issue we had they sat us in the back room which is small an uneventful... Bar scene looked good. We will be returning
August 23, 2014|Great night all around!|5|Our server was awesome! The food was amazing! The dessert and drinks were perfect! Can't wait to go back
August 20, 2014|Great dinner|5|Met a friend for dinner. Food and drinks were great!
July 26, 2014|The Fire|5|Excellent food and even better service. There were 8 in our group and every one enjoyed their meal.
July 7, 2014|Pleasantly Surprised - Great Menu|5|A surprisingly good restaurant in the middle of an area not known for its outstanding cuisine. Tim waited on us - a table of 8 with three young children. The service was great, Tim was patient, attentive, and accommodating. The menu had so many great plates it was hard to choose. Braised ribs were delicious, as was lobster ravioli, bruschetta, and many others. Portions are huge. The cookie pizza dessert was decadent.

May 31, 2014|Graduation RISD Luncheon|5|We found this place online read good reviews and tried it. Our waiter was wonderful very enthusiastic and attentive. Best clams and spag ever I mean ever thanks! Everything was great!
Dined on April 27, 2014|cozy dinnig for two|5|This one of my wife and I favorite spots we have never had a bad meal here. The oil and garlic and hot bread yum. We usually go early for their early bird specials or one of their fire grilled pizzas .
April 20, 2014|Disappointing meal|2|"The meal for Easter Sunday included a favorite, leg of lamb. The lamb was very disappointing. Not only was it overcooked and dry, there were only 2 - 1"" x 2 1/2"" slices. The meal was $18 and only came with potatoes and broccoli. The service was very good, but it was still a disappointing meal."
April 5, 2014|"Pour water on the ""Fire"""|2|Living in the Prov, RI area, we are are lucky to have fine restaurants, Italian, and otherwise, located within 20 minutes or so from where we live. Getting a good piece of veal with pasta, should be a pretty standard thing. The sauce actually was pretty good. I understand when the veal is not quite dry, the coating doesn't stick when you fry it. It decomposed and began to mix with the not too bad sauce. That's right, gritty, and pasty. In the other fifteen or so restaurants I have had veal in,in the area, I never quite experienced this texture in my mouth. No ! Grits don't count. Needed a sharper knife for the veal itself. All kidding aside. Wine ok, clams casino ok, wife's pasta/ meat sauce ok, and waitress good. But never again !!
April 5, 2014|Great food.|4|I had the grilled swordfish tips with rice. The food was cooked right and tasted great. A bit pricey but all in all it was really good.
March 29, 2014|Pizza & Wine|4|We have dined at The Fire for many years (it was formerly know as Wild Fire) and the food has always been very good. Our favorite is the brick oven pizza's, they are delicious, always cooked to perfection, paired with a salad and glass of wine makes a great night at the fire.
March 13, 2014|Close to home and good!|4|Have been to the Fire for quick family celebrations...our family including my 82 year old father have always enjoyed our dinner. Service is very attentive, food consistently good. It's not always convenient to head to the hill for dinner. This is a good restaurant that provides a variety of food choices,with a nice casual atmosphere .
March 8, 2014|Excellent!|1|This was a last minute find on Open Table and wow, we were really impressed! A great restaurant, great food and great atmosphere - servers were excellent and bar atmosphere is great! Just a great place! We will visit again for sure!
February 15, 2014|We thoroughly enjoyed our|5|We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at The Fire Restaurant. We have eaten there several times when bringing our college students out for a meal and it is always dependable and delicious!
February 14, 2014|Therestaurant was nice the|3|Therestaurant was nice the ambiance was nice my husbands spaghetti was not that great and my shrimp scampi was dry and not very flavorful
February 10, 2014|The early-bird specials menu|5|The early-bird specials menu was not offered to us. I would not have known about it unless I found your menus on -line. Also, you menu on line offered spumoni as a dessert menu item for the early-bird specials and was not an option in the store. Otherwise, everthing was excellent. I tried a new dish, polenta that I would not have tried if our waitress did not recommend it so highly. All was delicious!
February 1, 2014|Good food at reasonable prices!|4|We usually try and eat a Federal Hill, but this one popped up on OpenTable so we tried it. Very glad we did! Food was reasonable priced and very good. We ordered a bottle of wine that my daughter (who studied in Florence, Italy) said was her teachers favorite. It was delicious and I think about $31. I decided on the braised short ribs which were served on a bed of broccoli rabe and mashed potatoes. This dish was fantastic!!! My daughter had the roasted filet mignon which was served with truffle mac n cheese and grilled eggplant. She said it was very good and cooked perfectly. My husband had the Tagliatelle Bolognese and a side order of meatball. He was not impressed and thought his meal was just OK. Cannolis were only partially filled.
January 18, 2014|Food was ok, mediocre at best.|2|Food was ok, mediocre at best. No better than a TGIF.
January 10, 2014|Good experience|4|Overall our dinning experience was good. The service and food was very good. The only problem was the size of the table for two and how close we were to the couple next to. We even joked about us blowing out thur candle on thier table. We would recommend this restaurant to others.
December 31, 2013|First time there on New Year's Eve|1|We got there on time and waited 15 minutes to be seated (which was fine since it was pretty busy). Within 10 minutes of sitting down we ordered all of our food (appetizers and entrées). Our appetizers came out quickly which was nice. However we did not see our server after that. After a while he happened to stop by again and I asked him if he knew when our food was coming since it had been a really long time (it had been over an hour at this point). He politely said it shouldn't take much longer and the kitchen was very busy. The next time we saw him, he came back with our food along with the manager who apologized for the wait. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I would eat here again if I was brought there.
December 31, 2013|Definitely a neighborhood gem!!|5|Love, love, love this restaurant! My family has been here many times and the food has always been perfect with no complaints. All the staff are very pleasant and the atmosphere is very relaxing. It's not your typical brick oven pizzeria as they have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. My husband especially loves their braised short ribs and orders it every time. I recently had bacon wrapped filet and it was cooked perfectly and was extremely tasty. Their prices are very reasonable and you never leave there hungry! They definitely get 5 stars from me and my family! Keep up the great work!!
December 29, 2013|Overall it was a nice experience.|4|Overall it was a nice experience. The menu is a bit small with not many choices, for lunch anyways. I had help from my waitress to choose something good to eat. Good recommendation, but wish she told me it was from a dinner menu because it was a 19$ lunch item and I couldnt eat it all nor bring it home that day since I wasnt going home for hours.
December 24, 2013|Disappointed|1|I visited the Fire a couple times before deciding to have xmas eve dinner there. I was completely impressed with the food, service and ambiance. But for some reason, when we went on xmas Eve it was nothing but disappointing!! First the waiter took forever to acknowledge us, next when we finally did receive our food it was horrible!. I ordered stuffed shrimps with glazed carrots and mashed potato. I literally received four tiny shrimps that were piled high with stuffing, the carrots were not cooked through and were hard without a hint of any glaze on it. My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf, and received a 5oz steak that didn't taste like anything! Very disappointed! Not returning there ever.
November 17, 2013|Another great meal|5|We have been to Fire many times and again we were very pleased with our meal. We had the Sunday special with family chicken. It was delicious from salad to main course. The chicken was very well seasoned and the pasta and potatoes were so delicious as well.Of course we love the fire baked rolls and roasted garlic oil. We highly recommend this friendly place to anyone who loves Italian delights.
November 15, 2013|coat closet|3|made reservations on line. they wanted to know if it was our first time there said yes. was seated in a room the size of a coat closet with 4 tables each 2x2 with no view of anything. online had early bird specials but were never told until we asked. same thing happened to the only other couple sitting in this area . by the way plenty of booths in main room empty. they even know my name as we were the only people with 5 o'clock reservations food was good and service was also
October 26, 2013|The food was very good. We|5|The food was very good. We enjoyed having Dino as our waiter, he was very prompt and always delivered.
September 28, 2013|Great Menu and Staff|5|We came for the first time and were looking for a yummy menu to accomodate 10 people and two were toddlers. Perfect. We called to bump up our reservation and they did it with ease and even called to let us know there may be a slight wait for the new time (maybe 5 min and the manager called for the heads up on a busy Saturday). Our server was great and not only was he attentive but nothing was missed. Water and bread filled and suggestion to order one larger meal for toddlers to split because we didn't know what the portions were like. Small gestures the I find make the experience that much more enjoyable and have slowly been forgotten by restaurants these days. Thank you, we would recommend it!
September 20, 2013|first bad meal|3|The chicken picatta was bitter tasting and burned tasting even though it wasn't really burned. It was to thick for picatta and no lemony buttery delicate flavor. Other choices were quite good, especially the mussells and clams and lobster. I was disappointed Friday night. The waiter, Tim, was very nice and did a great job. I don't eat out that often and I expected the food to be very good. The choice of swiss chard as the only veggie was strange as it is so controversial and bitter. There should have been other veggies to choose from. I will come back again for another try.
September 19, 2013|The price is right!|3|This is a good, moderately priced restaurant with good food. Early birds get a real bargain. Major set back for me was traveling on Mineral Spring Ave in North Providence at about 5:30pm...go earlier or later. Traffic was bad!
August 31, 2013|The food was very good, and|4|The food was very good, and priced reasonably. Unique preparation of their calamari.
July 30, 2013|FANTASTIC|4|My family and I eat at the Fire about twice a month. It is a perfect place to dine on anything from grilled pizza's, salads, pasta's to perfectly cooked lemon chicken, veal chops and many other fine foods, not to mention their clam and sausage appetizer with mouth watering broth. The menu an Italian flair and everything is cooked to perfection. By the way, they have the best steamers during the summer that you will find anywhere and I mean anywhere. One gripe....(ok no big deal) but the cheap, tissue paper thickness napkins are TERRIBLE. Ok, I got that off my mind. Just go and have a great meal.
May 25, 2013|My husband and kids had dinner|4|My husband and kids had dinner there for the first time, and I have to say, it was a very nice experience. The food was great. Everything from apps to meals came out hot and just the way we ordered it. We will definitely go back.
May 25, 2013|We had a fun, pleasant dinner|4|We had a fun, pleasant dinner (a couple of parents and a few college kids). The atmosphere was casual and fun, the service was very welcoming and friendly, and the food was really good.
May 22, 2013|New favorite!|4|I've been twice now for lunch and dinner. Both meals were very good. I had the pork chop for dinner which was excellent. They have a good bar with many choices. The atmosphere is hip but feels old. The large booths are great for large parties and are comfortable. I will be going back.
May 11, 2013|Just ok|2|Used to like this place but seems to have lost it's charm with me. I was on a diet so ordered the Tuscan Steak salad. This used to have plenty og slices of nice rare steak but tonight it was just a small amount of little pieces of meat- not with much flavor and augmented by grilled mushrooms that you thought was beef until you bit into it. I recall needing a doggie bag in the past but I. Left hungry, went home and had a protein bar! Hubby had roasted chicken wings which were fine. Service was fine too, but sort of noisy due to large parties nearby. Maybe pizza and pasta entrees still good but they are skimping on the salads. Won't go back unless I am off my diet.

March 15, 2013|we like to get together once|5|we like to get together once a month and this is the place to do it. it's convenient for everyone and it's great to be able to make reservations. we enjoy coming for the appy hour and then having dinner while catching up. I recommend the Fire to anyone who likes to do the same. the servers are wonderful!
March 9, 2013|Our family had a very enjoyable|4|Our family had a very enjoyable time. We all loved our meals, and the appetizers were very good as well. The wait staff was very knowledgable & friendly as was management.

November 8, 2012|We were in a hurry, They Delivered!|5|We had tickets to the PPAC for a 7:30pm show which I told The Fire about through Open Table. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The Manager came over and told me she read my message on Open Table, knew we had tickets and that they would make sure we made the show on time. The waitress came right over and took our order. The Espresso Martinis came right away, and let me say, they are one of the best around!!! The meals came not that long after, and they were hot and delicious!!! Everything about this dining experience was great...I will go there again and again!!!
October 19, 2012|VERY ENJOYABLE|4|Very interesting menu. Four people had 4 different things and all enjoyed very much. My vegetable was roasted peppers. Very delecious and not often found on a restaurant menu. We will certainly go here again.

September 14, 2012|Food was good and a nice treat|4|Food was good and a nice treat not in the city. Our waiter could have been a bit more attentive - empty glasses for a bit...but other than that - all in all a good meal out! Will be back for sure - LOVE the chopped salad - this is a fave!!
August 18, 2012|our first visit|4|We visited The Fire for the first time and we were very pleased. The food and service were excellent. Our seating was a bit complicated. We were a group of 7 and they had to put two tables together in order to fit us. The tables were different heights so that made the seating uneven as well. Despite this we had a great time and we would definitely recommend and return!
May 13, 2012|I loved the resturant when|2|I loved the resturant when I first walked in. They sat us right next to the kitchen which I thought was odd seeing the resturant was not full. There were customers yelling to the cooks apparently they knew each other. The veal was over cooked and the lobster tail was salty. The steak was cooked well and very tasty. But overall not sure I would make a special trip in again. I was very disappointed.

For my main course, I had the short ribs. They were Okay. A little grisly. The table shared pitchers of sangria, which was excellent.

This was our second time to eat at The Fire in less than 10 days and we were not disappointed. the Chef's Dinner recommendation for the evening was excellent. The Lobster Bisque with Filet and bacon-wrapped shrimp was perfect. We will return.

February 11, 2012|Great 'all purpose' restaurant.|4|Great 'all purpose' restaurant. Brought our dad for his 65th birthday. Last year we went to Provided Oyster Bar, which is great, but I like the Fire more. We also brought our 11 month old & felt comfortable with her there. Just a warning - there is no changing table...

January 28, 2012|I celebrated my 50th birthday|4|I celebrated my 50th birthday there on a Saturday night with four friends. Four of us ordered 2 pizzas to share, our fifth friend ordered gnocchi. We were all very happy with the food. We also had a couple of bottles of wine and some really delicious desserts. The noise level was fine - we were all able to converse easily. Though the place was very busy when we arrived, no one rushed us through our meal and in fact, we spend 3 hours there. The waitstaff was friendly. We would have appreciated being greeted a little more quickly when we arrived and to have our used plates taken away more promptly, but these are petty complaints. I was glad I'd chosen The Fire and will definitely go there again.
