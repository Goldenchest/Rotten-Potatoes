ays ago|Fabulous Food|4|Food is excellent!! Siena is a favorite date night spot for a special occasion. I prefer the ambiance in the Smithfield location better. Valet is great, and so is being on the Hill, but in Smithfield there is a parking lot and easy navigation in and out.

ays ago|A night at Siena|4|We arrived at 6:30 for a 7pm reservation and they were able to accommodate us very nicely. The hostess and staff were excellent. The only drawback was the portion of the eggplant parmesan. I raved about it from a past experience and the portion seemed to have shrunk. That was my only disappointment. Other than that it was a good start for the game at the Dunk which PC won!
February 28, 2016|Romantic and Delicious|5|"I picked Siena for my birthday dinner and I was not disappointed. It's one of those places where you rubber neck all the food going by and whisper ""oooo! what's that?!?"" Husband got Frutti di Mare that was generous with the seafood. I got Tagliatelle alla bolognese - I'm still thinking about it four days later. Best plate of pasta. I want it again. Right now. Tiramisu - fabulous, good size. I got chocolate hazelnut gelato that tasted like an ice cream Ferrero Rocher. All that, calamari and a glass of wine and it was $70. We will be back."
February 27, 2016|solid Federal Hill choice|5|Always outstanding food. A solid Federal Hill choice for Italian food

February 18, 2016|Siena experience|5|Siena has been and will be my go to restaurant for the best italian food in RI. Every single time i eat or have eatten here the food and service are exceptional. No matter what i order its amazing. I am a true foodie and chef so im a picky eatter and this restaurant is top notch. Siena at the bar is always amazing and understands how to beva grest bartender while tending to every guests needs. I always bring out of town people here and they are always blown away! Appreciate al you do!
February 18, 2016|Great food but high noise level.|4|The food and service was amazing...but VERY noisy. Would not recommend as a romantic evening or when you want to have a conversation you would want to keep private as you have to raise your voice to be heard by a dining companion. Seriously some of the best food I have eaten.

February 18, 2016|Great dinner before theater|5|We enjoyed a great dinner before a show at PPAC. We started with the traditional calamari and loved it! Two people had the shrimp and risotto dish and every bite was eaten. I had the braised short ribs and didn't even need a knife - sooo tender. The meal's pace was appropriate for the time we had and we love the valet parking on busy Atwells Ave.
February 18, 2016|Amazing night out , top service|5|We had reservations for 5:30 and they sat us early. Amazing corner table at front window , and the service was outstandIng, we were not rushed and the place was jammed. Our waiter was extremely personable , knowledgeable and helped us make choice. From the eggplant filled with ricotta , mixed greens with pears , veal saltimbocca, sea bass and even bread pudding all were perfectly cooked , incredible flavor and made our dinner out perfect.
February 17, 2016|Even though wstill had a 25 minute wait.|5|Food was delicious and staff pleasant and very attentive! Well worth the wait!
February 13, 2016|So Good!!|5|My husband and I went to Siena because of a recommendation from my brother. This is his favorite restaurant in Federal Hill. We were not disappointed!! First of all, the staff was awesome. Each was welcoming and helpful from taking our coats, to our drink order at the bar as we waited for our table, to our outstanding waitress. Our dinner was delicious. I had the house specialty of calamari with cherry peppers and balsamic vinegar. This was the most tender calamari I've had. I also had the veal saltimbacca. Delicious! My husband had the oyster special as an appetizer and the lobster ravioli as his entre. Both were outstanding. So worth the visit!
February 13, 2016|Overall fantastic experience|5|Great food, great service even on a packed night. No wait at all on food and drinks.
February 13, 2016|Excellent experience|5|Staff was friendly polite and efficient. Server was as good as we've ever had. Tasting plate would have been good as a meal with a nice glass of wine. Branzino was superb. Veal chop was tender big and perfectly grilled. Maybe the best was the banana cheesecake with a grappa. Just perfect.

Food was amazing, wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. The owner was truly amazon. He work the whole dining area all night making sure everyone was ok and treated you like family. This is how it's done. Great Job Thanks
February 13, 2016|Never disappoints!|5|Our dinner at Sienna's, on the February 13th was awesome.. The service was fabulous, as always. In spite of a very busy evening, we were never rushed through our dinner. Everything was served perfectly. Cocktails were yummy, food was delish, wine was wonderful. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We will certainly be back!
February 12, 2016|early valentines dinner|5|Love the ease of the valet & then I also was impressed how the bartenders made you feel comfortable even when the bar was full. They got us a drink & kept us informed about seats at the bar that would be opening up. Most full bars you are fighting just to get a drink & the bartenders could care less if you got a seat. I do wish we just stayed at the bar and ate. I did not really care for out table for 2 in the middle of the room. I could hear everyone conversations. I have been a few other times w/ more ppl 7 had a big round table that I enjoyed much better. Maybe that's the key to go w/ more ppl. Overall we had a nice dinner & the food was very good & the chocolate martinis too.

February 11, 2016|Excellent|5|Our dinner was fantastic. Our waiter was wonderful and was always there at the right moment. Food was excellent and the night was perfect.
February 10, 2016|Very unhappy|1|Swordfish was way over cooked, paella was like rubber, grouchy unfriendly waitress, had to change tables due to loud obnoxious patrons. We did complain and were comped 2 glasses of wine. My girlfriend wanted me to try it as she liked it before. She has said she will never go back. Ambience? TGIF.
January 30, 2016|Love this place|5|This is our 3rd year meeting friends at Siena in Providence. It is the 1/2 way point - traveling 1.5 hrs to get there. How I wish I lived closer. The food is fantastic!! The prices are very reasonable. Great valet parking too. We prefer to sit in the front. The noise level can be high, but with good friends and great food, who cares!
January 29, 2016|Great Nite at Siena|5|We had a wonderful time at Siena The food was outstanding, our server went out of her way to ensure my wife's diary allergy was addressed in the kitchen before our food was served. The wine list included a Gem, $60 retail 2012 Cali Cab on the list for $89. Way to go Siena.
January 28, 2016|great service|5|i have been to the other Siena locations feel that the portions in providence doesn't compare. noise level is very loud. we were seated at a small table in the back which was very tight. waitress was excellent. she was vibrant and engaging.
January 22, 2016|Wonderful evening on the hill|5|We went for dinner and found out it was Providence Restaurant Week, three courses for a set price. The choices were varied and we all found what we wanted. The wine by the glass program has some great wine and as I was the only drinker of our table of three, by the glass was perfect. The food was delicious. Our server Gabby went above and beyond with an incredible personality to compliment her great service. We will be back often. Luckily there is a Sienna in East Greenwich as well, this visit was due to business in Providence.
January 22, 2016|Not completely impressed|3|I don't know if the standards are lower during restaurant week, but I wasn't impressed with the main course I ordered. The pork chop was so tough that even with a steak knife it was difficult to cut. The flavors here are very good overall, but I would say for this price, I won't be coming back.
January 22, 2016|Great food and great service but very lo...|4|Great food and great service but very loud. Definitely not a spot for a romantic night out.
January 22, 2016|This place is something special.|5|Highly recommended! We were greeted by friendly owner Anthony and given a table by the window. Nick was our very attentive server. We ordered the signature meatball to start. Delicious. We split the taglietelle bolognese and the chicken Parm and then the Doughboys for dessert. Everything was outstanding. Beyond impressed with the staff, even James who came to fill our waters was gracious and kind.
January 21, 2016|Delicious. Everything was fantastic.|5|Jamie was outstanding as our server. Food delicious!!
January 18, 2016|Wonderful service|5|We really enjoyed the evening at Sienna. It was nice to find a spot that would take a 10pm reservation.
January 17, 2016|Delicious!|5|My husband took me here for my birthday. I had the sea bass and it one of the best dishes I have ever tasted! We also had the banana cheesecake for dessert. Service was wonderful.

January 17, 2016|Another great meal|5|Went for restaurant week. The menu offered a good selection at a very reasonable price for 3 courses.
January 17, 2016|Our servers Audra, with occasional fill ...|4|Our servers Audra, with occasional fill in by Tatiana when helpful, were out of this world. Both were so incredibly professional yet in the most casual and friendly of ways. A difficult balance to achieve yet they did so with grace, elegance and efficiency without any of the snobby attitude that can ruin and otherwise lovely evening. I would return just for them. Oh, by the way, the food was really tasty too.
January 17, 2016|The tables in front of the bar are to cl...|4|The tables in front of the bar are to close together difficult for the waitress staff to serve the food, very inconvenient for the customers This is the second time we seat at this table and I can't understand why management don't realize how bad service is provided due to the way they want to squeeze more customers that eventually they going to lose To many choices
January 16, 2016|food is great|4|come for the food, everything else is nice too. i have been there so many times. i usually eat a little more elegantly when out on date night with the husband, but i couldnt resist the funghi pizza. thats all i ate and was in heaven.
January 16, 2016|Visiting Providence|4|"We were in town from NYC and had heard good things about Siena. The server was attentive & the atmosphere was lovely - we had dinner early at 5:30 so I am not sure how it would be later on. Three of the meals were delicious - margarita pizza, shrimp fra diavlo, and a seafood entree. However, I had the pasta bolognese as it was a ""signature dish"" but it was oily and unflavorful. Everyone at the table tried my dish (without my saying anything negative about it) and they all said the exact same thing after dinner. My husband felt terrible that my dinner was so terrible while everyone else's was terrific. Even my wine by the glass wasn't great. But since everyone else enjoyed the restaurant so much, maybe it was just an off meal out of the kitchen - though I only got it because it was supposedly one of their better dishes. It happens. If you are in the area, Siena has a nice vibe and is worth a visit (though maybe pass on the pasta bolognese.)"
January 15, 2016|A Federal Hill gem|5|"We know that there are MANY excellent restaurants on Federal Hill, but Siena is our ""go to "". The food, service and ambiance are all outstanding. The people are so friendly. It is a restaurant to return to frequently when we are in Providence."
Dined on January 15, 2016|SERVICE SUBPAR FOOD BLAND SEATING TOO TIGHT|1|SERVICE WAS NON-EXISTENT. SERVER NEVER CHECK ON US WHEN FOOD CAME OUT PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE LARGER PARTIES EVEN THOUGH WE WERE BUYING BOTTLES OF WINE. FOOD WAS BLAND AND LACKED PRESENTATION. MY DINNER WAS DRY AND OVER COOKED. SEATING WAS ONE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO THEY COULD HAVE MORE LARGER TABLES I HAD TO KEEP MOVING MY CHAIR SO PEOPLE COULD GET BY. OVERALL VERY DISAPPOINTING CONSIDERING THE $$$ WE SPENT.
January 10, 2016|My Favorite Restaurant|5|After visiting Siena Providence the other night, I decided that it is hands down my favorite restaurant. I live south of Boston, about an hour away and the drive is absolutely worth it. The service is impeccable; water refilled frequently and our waiter stopped by at decent intervals without stalking our table. Waiter was helpful with suggestions and knowledgeable of the menu. The food is always top notch! The men in our group started out with Caesar salads and I stole a bite of my hubby's it was crisp and cold. My friend and I shared the crab cake appetizer and were pleasantly surprised to find that it was all crab and no filler! I got the Chilean Sea Bass and it was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My dining partners shared a side of eggplant parmesan and let me try it; we all agreed it was the best we had. The eggplant was so thin. My husband ordered the Bolognese and he loved his meal as well. My friend (a former restaurant owner and total foodie) ordered his favorite dish, veal scaloppini and declared it one of the best he had ever had. I was too full for dessert but went ahead anyway and ordered a bourbon apple bread pudding with caramel ice cream - delicious! I can't wait to go back, and I was so glad to introduce my friends to such a wonderful restaurant!
January 10, 2016|A Tuscan Memory|5|Our son was in Spannochia Italy for a school trip a we wanted to enjoy some Tuscan type food that he was also trying for the first time but a great distance away. The same night we visited Siena's he was making his own pizza as we tried the same style over here. It was great being able to send him pictures of our dining experience to share with him. The service, food and atmosphere was fantastic . Our server was very knowledgeable with the menu and with the pronunciations which no one in our party even came close. She was very pleasant and attentive to our needs. We will definitely return again and bring our son with us so that he may the enjoy our experience that we had that evening.
January 2, 2016|Excellent food. We were a party of five,...|5|Excellent food. We were a party of five, and everyone loved their meal. Restaurant was bustling on a Saturday night, but we were seated exactly on time with our reservation. Service was professional, classy, and with a smile. Would go back tonight if I could!
January 1, 2016|Great Menu!|5|It was hard to make a choice on both entree and dessert due to such a great menu!

December 30, 2015|Best Italian food I've had in a while!|5|To start, the service was great, our waitress was very attentive and we received our food and drinks in a timely manner even though the restaurant was packed. I would suggest making a reservation because it was very busy, even the bar was filled! The food was all amazing, especially the gnocchi dish and the risotto side that we ordered. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
December 29, 2015|I hate to rate it so great|5|The problem with rating a great restaurant is that people will then want to go to the restaurant and it is harder to get into yourself. However, we have benefited from other's great reviews and need to do the same. Incredible food, great service, and we are already thinking about going again.
December 28, 2015|Nice|4|First time at providence location Food was good our waitress was really nice restaraunt was cramped and freezing! Service was slacking on refilling water glasses ... Apple bread pudding with Carmel gelato amazingggg!! Lemon creme brûlée not so great! Overall good expierence would go back, I prefer Smithfield location

December 26, 2015|Great new Italian find in Providence!|5|We had an incredible meal at Sienna - the Sea Bass was phenominal, as was the tiramusu-different with a cocoa crunch coating. The waitress was very knowledgeable and pleasant. A great culinary experience!
December 22, 2015|Everything was just Top!|4|What a wonderful evening we enjoyed at Siena! Beautiful Food, Lovely Wine, Excellent Waitstaff - Friendly and Extremely Helpful - not only with wine selections but knowledgeable with the best spots to visit, see and enjoy in the Providence area. Would absolutely recommend 100% dining in this establishment !
December 22, 2015|Perfect for any occasion!|5|Three days before Christmas, fairly busy night on Federal Hill in Providence but Siena offered great food and service. The starters, pasta, and entrees were all delicious. A great selection of wines was available and we had a window table. All we lacked was a light snow!
December 13, 2015|No red sauce|5|Good food small table nice to have food not swimmong on gravy
December 12, 2015|Fantastic food|5|My wife and I went with another couple and the service and food was just wonderful. This wonderful dinning experience is a real treat from beginning to end. We got a variety of appetizers and salads. The dinners were also scrumptous and we met the owner Chris who really cares about his business an it shows, it was great to meet him. Looking forward to trying the smithfield locatin on soon. If you go ask for Heather fantastic waitress!
December 12, 2015|Very disappointed|3|One appetizer came out stone cold, and the Chicken Franchase was too deep fried to describe. One of the least appealing presentations in quite a while. Staff was sympathetic , tried to do the right thing, but you can't fix somethings. Previously enjoyed, but won't be back soon.
December 6, 2015|Second time to Siena and was just as goo...|5|Second time to Siena and was just as good as the first time. Food,service, everything was great. Highly recommend!
December 4, 2015|excellent find|5|we had a great time. We had requested a table away from the door and as requested it was, right next to the electric fireplace, very nice. Great service and food after visiting Providence College with my daughter. If she goes there we will definitely be back.
November 27, 2015|Perfect From Start to Finish!|5|I love that Siena takes reservations! The food was top notch and they made the perfect martini. Our server, Gabrielle, was warm and knowledgeable. This restaurant is outstanding!
November 27, 2015|Bargain|5|"If it's not already the best restaurant on ""the hill"" when you factor in prices it's head and shoulders above the rest."

November 16, 2015|Providence gem|5|Food was fabulous and waitress/future librarian extremely helpful regarding food choices to those of us in town for literacy conference.
November 15, 2015|Great authentic Italian food|4|Having visited Italy earlier this year, I have much higher standards now when it comes to Italian food. I'm happy to say Siena did not disappoint. I went with a group of three, and each of us loved our meals. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had. The Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese was delicious. And the desserts -- tiramisu, chocolate cake, and bread pudding -- were phenomenal. I'll definitely go back.

November 6, 2015|Casually classy|4|"Located in the heart of Federal Hill, Sienna offers a varied selection of food along with a generous selection of wines all without the pretentiousness of many establishments on ""The Hill"". Affordable priced entrees served in a quiet, reserved atmosphere. Great for that ""special"" occasion."
November 6, 2015|JCC1|5|Every course was spectacular, and the price point is something to cherish and celebrate as these days, you usually don't get such a wonderful as well as greatly appreciated combination! A definite #1 for Italian cuisine in Providence!
November 5, 2015|Always wonderful!|5|I love Siena and have been to all three locations in Rhode Island. Providence is my favorite probably due to the fact that it was my first experience with this fabulous restaurant. I especially enjoy when I get to sit in the back room because it is much more intimate. I can't wait to go back again soon!
November 5, 2015|past experiences good, this last time not so good.|3|Bolanase was bland and dry and chicken cutlets were dry and overcooked. Salmon and shrimp specials over risotto was very good. Overall average.
November 5, 2015|Great Italian restaurant|5|"We enjoyed our meal - the food was great. Our meals included Short Ribs, chicken and Shrimp. We started with the ""traditional"" calamari but were a tad disappointed because the calamari was not sautéed with the hot peppers. If you wanted that flavor you had to add the peppers to the fried (plain) calamari. Not really our favorite. The restaurant was crowded but the service was good and we were not delayed in any way. The noise level made it a little difficult to have a conversation - but overall a good experience."

October 31, 2015|Great place|5|From the moment the Valet came out to the hostesses and then to the bartender and waitress everything was very nice. It was a busy night and the bar was packed. The bartender came out from behind the bar to greet us and offer wine selection information so as to not have to yell over the other guests, I've never seen someone do that. Our overall experience at Siena was excellent and we will return.
October 31, 2015|Great food-bad seating|3|Our second visit.. Knew the food would be great... We were placed in a booth right near the door and when it got busy patrons stood and stared at us.. As they came in they stood right beside our booth and looked on ... Not happy with that seating arrangement... Hostesss should have moved them
October 30, 2015|Delicious Italian Spot for Special Occasions|5|Our waitress was wonderful and attentive throughout the entire dinner. She discovered that we recently got engaged that afternoon in Providence, therefore the staff kindly went out of their way to do what they could to help celebrate our big day. Big thanks for making it special. Enjoyed the atmosphere, superb Italian cuisine, and wine / cocktail list!
October 24, 2015|Perfect|5|What a gem! From the time I made the reservation, including a special table request, through paying the bill, everyone was friendly. The food was delicious and portions were just right. Thank you for a memorable evening.

October 24, 2015|Perfect Ending of a Perect Day|4|Friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. Great apps shared at the table with a bottle of Prosecco...nice that there was a choice. Dinner was good....Bolognese was a bit heavy and not in the red sauce that I expected...but good. Would definitely return again to try other things on the menu.
October 23, 2015|Top Italian Restaurant in Food and Service|5|Out towner, first time visit to Siena. Went there based on reviews. I am Italian and rarely eat at Italian Restaurants in the US. My husband and I went with another couple and we each had 4 different dishes. Each dish was delicious and the service was excellent. Overall experience was rated top-notch. I see why they are No. 1 in the area. Keep up the great work!

Dined on October 23, 2015|Love Love Love Siena!|5|We've been to Siena many times and they never, ever disappoint. We normally go to their suburban location, which is roomier. This was the first time we were seated in the rear portion of the restaurant and it was great. Much more spacious and comfortable back there. Food and drink quality were superb. Arch Martini is a favorite. Seasonal Fig Martini was also very good, especially the Gorganzola stuffed olives. Squash and Apple-Spinach salads were both very good. Filet special was tender and perfectly cooked. No need for a knife with the braised Short Rib with Parmesean Risotto. Staff recognized the birthday we were celebrating on the dessert plate, which was nice. Pumpkin Sponge Cake with Caramel Sauce and Apple Bread Pudding with Salted Caramel Gelato were outstanding.
October 18, 2015|Great spot for a date night|5|Went here for our anniversary dinner, food was great, service was great, will definitely go back
October 18, 2015|Not up to the usual standards|3|This has traditionally been one of our favorite restaurants. The last visit was disappointing. The menu was reduced. The service was fair and the food just not up to the mark.

October 16, 2015|Delicious Italian Cuisine!|5|"We enjoyed our leisurely dinner at the Siena Providence very much. We started out with our ""starter course"" with a delicious Calamari all' Aceto Balsamico (fried calamari rings tossed with cherry peppers, diced tomatoes & a balsamic vinegar reduction) and a Insulate Casa. We had two entrees, the Frutti di Mare which was fresh and delicious! My wife had the Branzino (Chilean Sea Bass finished with ocean scallops) which was slightly undercooked. For dessert we shared a Budino di Melle (Apple bread pudding baked in a vanilla custard topped with caramel gelato and topped with caramel sauce) which was superb! The bill with a $25 tip came to $140.00."
October 10, 2015|fantastic|5|Loved this place. The staff was very accomidating and helpful. The food is great. The appetizer cheese plates are great way to share food. Would go again anytime.
October 9, 2015|Always Incredible|5|Food, drink and service.... All 3 always amazing!!!
October 8, 2015|Great experience|5|Everything was great. Delicious food, great wine, awesome dessert
October 4, 2015|Providence Vibe with Quality Dining|4|Fresh and delightful but too loud on Sunday night for four of us, some with aged ears for a reunion conversation, yet the Siena antipasti is of excellent quality, the service fantastic, and the 4 main courses and 2 desserts were perfectly cooked and presented and we were all quite happy with our first visit to Siena. Would definitely go again!
October 3, 2015|Say yes to braised short ribs!|4|The food was the best part of this restaurant... Very cramped and loud dining area. I had the braised short ribs which were phenomenal! My husband had delicious gnocchi. Deserts were also fabulous. Calamari was ok... We've had better in the Ocean State. Not overly expensive... Good spot if you don't mind the atmosphere.

I tried something new which was still good just not better than the lobster ravioli or pollo rosemarino. Either way service was stellar and it was a great and much needed date night!!!!
September 27, 2015|pasta|3|was highly rated - but was disappointed with the pasta dinner we had. overall ambience was good.
September 26, 2015|Outstanding dinner.|4|Out meal at Siena was outstanding! I had the Short Rib and my wife had Chilean See Bass. In both cases it was one of the finest meals we've ever had. My short rib with risotto and was out of this world. One of my all time favorite meals. For desert my wife had a hazelnut gelato and I had the tiramisu. The tiramisu was the BEST desert I've ever had. It was amazing! Perfect level of sweetness. Cannot say enough about this desert. My only complaint about this restaurant is the noise level. We sat in the bar area. When we go back I will definitely as to be seated in the main restaurant area and hopefully it will be quieter. That being said I would not hesitate to go back.

September 18, 2015|So Good|5|I can't say enough about our dinner at Siena. Everything was so good and the service was great.
September 17, 2015|popular venue on Fed Hill. Something for all.|4|Very popular venue on a very popular dining area of Fede ral Hill in Providence. Superb apps and off menu specials. Something for everybody!-90
September 17, 2015|Excellent food and atmosphere.|5|The food was fantastic! The locations was great! The staff was extremely accommodating! Overall an excellent experience!!
September 17, 2015|Dinner before theatre at PPAC|5|Great location if you are attending a performance at PPAC or Trinity Rep since both are less than a 5 minute ride. Wedge salad was outstanding. Grilled center cut swordfish was the best I've had this season.
September 16, 2015|Fantastic|5|Went to eat on a Wednesday evening arriving early expecting a quiet restaurant for my friend's birthday. Sienna Providence was packed! Friendly dinner crowd at the bar which made it difficult to get a beverage while waiting for our reservation time. We stood with our beverages off to the side and watched the chefs at work creating the fabulous dishes. The service at Sienna was very friendly and the food meticulous tasting. A fantastic restaurant to go to for a great meal for a special occasion.
September 16, 2015|Always fabulous|5|A great place for a romantic dinner or to entertain clients. This restaurant never disappoints.
September 15, 2015|Was looking forward to Siena...|2|I was so looking forward to a wonderful Italian dinner on Federal Hill. Siena has great reviews which is why we picked it. We went on a Tuesday night - 7:30 reservation. It was busy and the place was almost full. The hostess was pleasant and seated us in the front dining room near the bar. It was SO noisy it was difficult to have a conversation. We could barely hear the server. The giant meatball was tasty. The soup was good. The entrees were disappointing - veal was low on flavor and chicken was dry. The service was decent but not amazing. We decided that we would not continue here with dessert. We left to have dessert somewhere else. Perhaps it was an off night for them but we would not go back.
September 13, 2015|The Best of Federal Hill|5|We've been dining here for 10 years. Love the staff, love the food - we've had many events here as well. Best value, best meal, best time. Thanks to All of you
September 13, 2015|Outstanding!|5|The lemon creme Brule was one of the best I've ever had. The penne Ala vodka was perfect. Service was top notch. If you want a more city like feel, sit in the front bar area. We wanted it more quiet so we sat in the back. Felt like we were in Italy. Service was top notch. Wonderful experience.
September 13, 2015|Done here on an empty stomach|5|Friendly service. Consistently outstanding food at a fair price. I make a point of going there whenever I'm in Providence. It's my go-to place when I want to delight friends.
September 12, 2015|Great Night|5|It was my and my now fiancé first time here. We always heard great things about Siena, but live a little distance away. I know she wanted to go sometime and her birthday was the perfect time. The food was excellent and our waitress Gabby was the best! We will definitely be back!!
September 12, 2015|One fine restaurant|5|We ordered the meatball as an appetizer to split among the six of us- it was AMAZING... light, delicious and the marinara sauce was fresh and yummy. Chilean sea bass was buttery and moist.. pasta with frutti di mare was good. Reasonable in price.. excellent service. We will return the next time we come to Providence.
September 11, 2015|Excellent food|4|Great food. Everything from the salad to the dessert was outstanding. Great atmosphere of small Italian dining. Great waiting staff and friendly feel. We will be back.
September 8, 2015|Excellent combination of service ato sph...|4|Excellent combination of service ato sphere and good food. Specials are very different than menu selections and seasonal. Something for every taste on the menu. Equally good choice for corporate or intimate dining and waitstaff rises to the occasion. I would recommend.
September 6, 2015|1st Wedding Anniversary Success|5|My husband and I both went to school in Providence, but neither of us had ever tried Siena. After careful researching of reviews we came to the decision to try it out! We were thrilled by our experience. We were greeted with a happy anniversary by the host and hostess (made sure to put it on our reservation), and seated right away even though we were about 20 min early. Our server, Dave, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended the Red Sangria for me over the white- great choice. When asked, he even explained to us why Buffalo Mozzarella is called Buffalo- it comes from a Buffalo cow. Our food was delicious- when in doubt of choosing between all the great options pick on of the Siena favorites! I had their eggplant appetizer and the short rib dinner. My husband had the Buffalo moz appetizer and Veal scallopini dinner. If we weren't so stuffed we would have tried one of their gormet desserts. A fabulous 1st anniversary experience!
September 6, 2015|Nice Italian on Federal Hill|5|We had dinner here on Labor Day weekend. It's a busy popular spot, so I'm glad we reserved ahead. The ciopino was excellent! Large pieces of lobster (in the shell), shrimp, and more plus a slightly spicy sauce just made a great entree. My husband loved the pasta Fagioli appetizer. Our server was top notch as well. The restaurant itself is not very large, and it is quite noisy. I would certainly return here next time I'm visiting Providence.
September 5, 2015|Loved the restaurant!|5|The food was absolutely incredible. The servers were super friendly, accommodating of food allergies and super helpful with meal suggestions.
September 5, 2015|Delicious|5|We go every time we're in the area - the food and service are incredible!
September 4, 2015|Great date night!|5|Wonderful romantic dinner - great place to spend the evening without the kids. Friendly service, delicious food. Hope to be back soon!
August 31, 2015|Dad's Birthday Dinner|5|We went to Siena, our fourth year in a row, for my Dad's birthday dinner. Our waiter, Nick, was attentive, knowledgeable about the specials and had an easy going, friendly demeanor. The dinner specials were enticing and it was nice to have the option of a wine special. The portions were average and almost all of us finished our dinners. My Dad looks forward to going to Siena and we will ne back next year hopefully, for his 90th.
August 30, 2015|Yum|4|We enjoyed our dinner at Siena. There were many large groups on the Sunday evening when we visited. We were seated in a back room that was much quieter than the front near the bar. We appreciated the quieter area because of my husband's hearing loss and the ability to carry on a conversation over our meal. Our Caesar salads were fine and our pasta dishes very good, although I found the bolognase sause sweeter than I prefer. Our waitress, Michele, I believe, was very attentive. The Federal Hill area is pretty quiet on Sunday evening, with the exception of the plaza area by the fountain where a large band was entertaining people and outdoor diners.

August 28, 2015|Great food|5|The complete dining experience was terrific. The waitress was friendly and infomrative, the ambiance was great, the food was fabulous.
August 23, 2015|Truly amazing Italian food|5|Not to be missed this restaurant has a genius at the helm. Mozzarella di bufalo salad with prosciutto di parma was among the best I ever had. The cheese was so fresh and flavorful! Tagliatelle bolognese was delectable and not heavy at all. Lemon creme brulee was beyond wonderful with perfect sugar crust. Would return many times.
Dined on August 23, 2015|Escellent food mediocre service|4|Food was great as always, service was mediocre at best waitress did not listen our requests very noisy in the back room We are coming for years to Siena this is the first time we are not satisfied
August 23, 2015|Excellent!|5|We had a wonderful meal!! Extensive menu which gives everyone a good variety to choose from. We tried appetizers too and everything was so delicious. The food was amazing and the staff were very friendly. And the drinks were good too. Good for groups and also a romantic dinner
August 18, 2015|Amazing|5|This place is great...the atmosphere is great and the service is always wonderful. Our favorites are the calamari, the risotto, eggplant rollatini and the penne alla vodka. The servers and hostess are always so pleasant...definitely a great spot in the Providence area.
August 16, 2015|Always excellent|5|We have been to Siena several times and have always enjoyed our meal This time was no exception It was my wife's birthday and when we arrived I informed the hostess They prepared a special Tirramiso On the plate they wrote Happy Birthday Nicki it was beautifully done They made a very nice meal special They continue to impress. Thank you!
August 16, 2015|A taste of Italy|4|Went here on recommendations from the internet and we were very happy with our choice. Very friendly atmosphere and the server we had could not have been nicer. We had eggplant rollatini and a shrimp special for appetizers. Delicious. My husband had his standard bologanase sauce and I had the swordfish with capers (which I love). Definitely recommend this restaurant great menu.
August 15, 2015|Service service our waitress, Donnawas outstanding|4|Service, service, service, our waitress, Donna was outstanding, and turned a so, so meal to 4 Stars. Our appetizers, Funghi Portabello ai Ferri, and Involtini di Melanzane was 5 Star plus, however my veal Chop was bland, Costoletta di Vitello, and was only warm. (med. Rare) It was a special occasion, we are a repeat customer and will return.
August 14, 2015|Disappointed|1|Read the reviews in the Rhode Island magazine. Went there for our Anniversary. The table next to us was so loud we could barely hear each other. My dinner was so over cooked I could not eat it. I was offered another dinner but it was after my Husband had finished his dinner. He did enjoy his fish. Being an Italian restaurant I went that route. We will not be going back here again.
August 12, 2015|Noise level|3|When I made the reservation, I asked for a quiet table as we were celebrating our anniversary. Our table was in the bar and very noisy - we had difficulty having a conversation. We usually go to the EG location but wanted to enjoy the ambiance of the Hill. The food was fantastic as always but I was very disappointed with our table location.
August 10, 2015|Great Food, Great Service|5|Went with a group of work colleagues and we were all very pleased with our experience. We had the jumbo meatball and calamari for apps. Both were fresh and delicious. I had the penne with vodka sauce and Jumbo Shrimp. It was perfect! Our server Karen was one of the best servers I have ever had. She knew her stuff and made us feel welcome.
August 10, 2015|Recommended|5|A visiting client wanted to enjoy Italian dining in Providence during a trip. I had no prior experience so I consulted OpenTable, TripAdvisor and a good friend from the area. Sienna seemed a good choice based on all the recommendations and reasonable price point. We dined early (5:30p reservation) and it was very available when we arrived, but packed when we left. Our server was personable and informative. Food and wine were excellent. Restaurant was clean and friendly. And Valet was prompt on arrival and departure. Would definitely recommend.
August 9, 2015|Great Food|5|This is the third or fourth time that my wife and I have been to Siena. The first time the food was good but the wait was ridiculously long even with a reservation. All the subsequent visits there was no wait and the food has been consistently good. The only downside to the restaurant is the noise level in the front dining room. I always request seating in the back room where I am able to have a conversation without yelling. The food is always great and the prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a place to eat in Providence.
August 9, 2015|Siena is my favorite restaurant on Atwel...|5|Siena is my favorite restaurant on Atwells Avenue in Providence. From appetizers to dessert, the menu is outstanding and there are always seasonal specials to please the palate. The service is impeccable with the hostesses, busters and waiters working seamlessly together. We always request a table at the front of the restaurant, and, although there are no guarantees, we have never been disappointed.
August 8, 2015|Great little Gem in the heart of Federal Hill|5|Let me first start by saying the service was impeccable! The waitress was clear and knowledgeable about the wine, specials, etc. They were very attentive from the time we walked in until the time we left. The food was absolutely delicious!!
August 6, 2015|Management could use a lesson in customer srvice|1|"When I made the reservation I requested a quiet table that would accommodate the two of us sitting beside each other. Upon arrival we were seated two tables from the bar, and a table that you had to sit across from each other. I turned the table so both of us could sit beside each other on the bench. The manager said I could not do that. I explained they had taken my reservation with the specific request. The manager replied that I was not ""allowed"" to adjust the table - I would bother the other customers. The bar (and TV) were so loud we could not hear each other across the table. I finally called the manager back over and told her that the seating arrangement was unacceptable. She moved us to the back of the restaurant to the same style table arrangement. As we approached the table, she turned to me and stated, ""Now, you cannot move this table either nor sit beside each other."" I kid you not... I chalk up her lack of customer friendly attitude to immaturity. I approached the people that were dining beside us and asked would they be offended if I sat next to my date... I understand if this would make you uncomfortable- I wont push the issue."" The lady laughed and said, ""Of course not... there is plenty of room."" The young manager turned around and walked away... (we bought our neighbors a drink for their kindness). The fact that you have to debate with an inexperienced manager the basics of good customer service makes this restaurant a ""do not return"" dining experience."

August 2, 2015|Terrific meal!|5|We were visiting Providence and the restaurant had been recommended by the hotel staff. What a wonderful meal! We love Italian food and were not disappointed! From the calimari friti and amazing insalada caprese (which could have been a meal in itself) to the delicious entrees to the limone sorbert, we ate so well! Our waiter Jeff was great in recommending just the right entrees and keeping us entertained!
August 1, 2015|Excellent food and nice ambience. Valet ...|5|Excellent food and nice ambience. Valet parking makes it an excellent place to visit with your loved ones.
August 1, 2015|We'd come back for sure!|5|We dined on 8/1 at an early seating so we could enjoy a leisurely meal and make it to the Waterfire lighting. Our waitress Michelle was delightful! She provided great advice about proportions (we shared apps, salads and desserts) as well as guided us through the menu choices. For table shared sides we ordered two specials rossitto and peas with crimini mushrooms, both were delicious! Among our meals we had the Scalapino piled high with delectable seafoods, swordfish cooked to perfection, veal salta nova, and veal scallopine - all were fabulous in flavor and served timely and hot. Oh, we enjoyed the Itallian wine of the day, recommended by our server and now are looking to purchase it locally. Dessert was Devine a gelato, crime brûlée and tiramisu :). Finally our waitress, Michekke, was actrue professional - knowing how to be of service without interrupting the flow of our meal and conversation while plenty friendly and engaging when appropriate. Lastly, when making our reservation I couldn't get a party of 8 at the time I wanted; called the restaurant and got a call back as soon as they opened and our party was readily accommodated. In the end were six and each would drive the hour and twenty minutes to come back!
July 31, 2015|Must try|5|Food was excellent and our waitress was fantastic... Would go back in heart beat.. Cesar salad was tasty and fish was done to perfection.. bread pudding lovers ... theirs is a must have
July 28, 2015|Simply awful.  The seafood was pre-froze...|2|Simply awful. The seafood was pre-frozen, the veal was overcooked. It was so loud that everyone was screaming to be heard. This was a recommended restaurant. Not sure how they got good scores. Super disappointed. Will never go back.
July 27, 2015|Monday not on their A game.|2|Went to celebrate son's birthday. Seated in back, not a very exciting area. Service was subpar, and did not meet expectations. Dripping from vents caused us to huddle to avoid drips from above. In the end, server forgot to recognize our son's birthday, (We asked specifically to have a dessert.) Usually we have a great experience, this one was dissappointing.
July 26, 2015|Had a great meal with wonderful service,...|5|Had a great meal with wonderful service, attentive yet not overbearing. Amanda, the bartender, offered up drink options with a warm smile and broad knowledge. Our server, Heather was outstanding; humorous and engaging, personable yet not nosy and hovering. She directed us to the wine special of the night, which was the perfect pairing to our entree selections. While the noise level in the front/bar area was lively, we were seated in the middle room which was perfect for conversation and a thoroughly enjoyable Sunday evening! On our next trip to Providence, we will definitely make plans to eat here again!
July 26, 2015|Delicious flavors|4|Terrific combinations of flavors. I had the veal porcini. Tender & wonderful!
July 26, 2015|Sunday Date NIght|1|I visited Siena based on many recommendation from friends and family. We ended up leaving after our appetizer because the service was so slow, appetizer took 40 minutes and server never came back for our dinner order after an additional 30 minutes.
July 26, 2015|always great|5|When we think federal Hill we always end at Siena, great food, drinks etc
July 25, 2015|What an amazing dinner! The Vodka pizza ...|5|What an amazing dinner! The Vodka pizza was out of this world and my friend's short rib and Rosemary chicken were just as fantastic. The waitress was very attentive and went out of her way to make us happy considering they were packed. Absolutely need to make a reservation with Open Table even if it is the same day. We were whisked directly to our table at our reservation time. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
July 23, 2015|Italian District Winner!|5|Had only read reviews and decided to book on open table. Seated promptly and the experience went up from their. Friendly wait staff that worked as a team. Reasonable price wine list let us enjoy two bottles instead of one like many restaurants tend to do. The others are missing the point. Siena gets most things right. Another benefit was it was Restaurant Week in Providence and the RW selections captured are full attention. I will go back and send others.
July 23, 2015|Wonderful Italian food on Federal Hill|5|My .husband and I were in town at a conference and chose Siena based on other reviews we had read. From the greeting, the wine service through to the bread and the three courses we had, the food was delicious and the service attentive and thorough

July 20, 2015|great food, too much noise|5|Everything about dinner was excellant, except for the noise level. They really need to use some soundproofing. We were unable to hear each other across the table through the entire meal.

Our server was friendly, informative and attentive (without being intrusive). Drinks were delicious and the food was fabulous! Portions were just the right size. We had no room for dessert, but the after dinner coffees and cordials were great. We would definitely come back for another special occasion!
July 16, 2015|Looking forward to going back!|4|We love the vibe at all the Siena locations, but Restaurant week is not the prime time to enjoy a leisurely dinner. Although we had a reservation, we waited awhile to be seated., and were disappointed that the table wasn't in back as we had requested. The front is very lively (loud) and difficult for older patrons with hearing issues. Unfortunately, seated next to a table of very loud young ladies having a girls night out didn't help our dining experience. Our server, Nick, did his best to attend to us, but it took awhile for the busy bar to deliver our cocktails. As usual though, our food was delicious, well prepared, and plated beautifully. We always enjoy pasta here, and the choices are fantastic. The veal chop was a special this evening though, and I am so glad I ordered the dish. Wild mushrooms and balsamic demi-glase just added the most wonderful flavor. All in all, we look forward to returning again, when we can enjoy the spot without the RWeek havock!
July 14, 2015|Always a Treat|5|We love going to Siena's. The food is wonderful, the service excellent and it's always a great experience. Love that it has valet parking. The meatball appetizer is a must. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. I requested a table by the window when I made my reservation via OpenTable and my request was honored. Looking forward to returning in the near future.
July 12, 2015|Personal followup on reservation and great food|4|"As with most Italian restaurants in Providence's ""little Italy"" section, Siena's food was excellent. Atmostphere was elegant and fairly quiet. The restaraunt called be before my reserved day / time to assure me they would honor my special request for a table by a window."
July 10, 2015|I not as good as prior experiences.|4|This was our third visit to Siena. The first 2 times were outstanding. The last time I was there I got the Sea Bass which was wonderful so my husband and I both ordered it this past visit and was definitely not as good. It was cooked perfectly but had a fishy taste. One of the guests at our table got the sirloin and it definitely had grill marks but that was it. No spice and no char. The last diner at our table got the chicken parm and it looked average, he said it was good. The desserts were fabulous and I had an after dinner dri k that was delicious.
July 10, 2015|Awesome!!!|5|Everything about our dining experience was terrific. Staff was very friendly, food was great and reasonably priced. The timing of my requested special accommodations, to celebrate my wife's birthday, was flawless and perfect. As first time patrons, we were quite impressed and do highly recommend Siena's to everyone.

July 6, 2015|The Providence Prize|5|When I go to Providence, I always stop at Siena. The food is delicious, consistent and solid. They do their basics right -- The veal Marsala is heavenly. The side of risotto is a meal in itself. Their specials aren't hokey or pretentious. Try, try, try to save room for dessert.
July 5, 2015|Food is always  delicious|5|Enjoy the menu and have tried various delicious entries
Dined on June 30, 2015|Great Place, greater service|4|Sirloin fair, a bit dry but tasty. Sides were awesome

June 21, 2015|The spot to go|5|Siena is a one of a kind place. Me and my girlfriend go there atleast once a month. Very romantic. Classy yet fun place. The wait staff is nothing but top notch. The way they carry themselves, speak and serve is top quality. The food is amazing and honestly not to pricy for what your gonna get. Great for date nights or even if you wanted to go with a group of friends or family. By far the best restaurant I have personally ever been to. The atmosphere makes you feel good. Between the scenery and ambiance it's not flashy nor out there. It makes you feel comfortable.
June 21, 2015|Good but not when busy|4|I have been to this restaurant several times and the food is always very good but I have to say that aspects of the Father's Day dinner were a bit disappointing. Presentation was off a bit and the usual serving sizes seemed a bit smaller. I was very disappointed in the Bologense...incredibly salty and the meat mixture was not enjoyable at all. On the other hand the pasta alla vodka was enjoyed. The appetizers were a big hit- the fig one was delicious and the mushroom caps with goat cheese delightful. This is a nice restaurant but the acoustics are bad when it is a busy day and the food and service can not be up to the usual standards,
June 21, 2015|Great food, good service|5|Can't go wrong with Siena. Halibut special during Father's Day weekend was delicious! The giant meatball was the go to appetizer for the kids. Highly recommend as always.
June 20, 2015|#1 for a Reason|5|In case you didn't know, Siena has been voted the #1 restaurant in Rhode island in four of the last 5 years. And thathonor comes for a reason. the food is superb, the service is impecable, and when you leave you feel as though you have just experienced something very, very special. Providence's Federal Hill is the italian heartbeat of the state, lined with restaurants to satify every palate. The Italian food here is unmatched anywhere (and that says a lot coming from a former New Yorker). And siena is simply the best of the best. You must stop in.
June 19, 2015|Nice restaurant, good food and service, ...|3|Nice restaurant, good food and service, but unbearably loud. Due to this, we probably will not return.
June 15, 2015|Staff|5|Wait staff and bartender were fantastic. They were very pleasant and attenttive
June 14, 2015|Awesome food and service|5|The meatball is amazing and is a must have! Everything from the hostess, to the waitress, to the dining experience was excellent. I will definitely recommend to my friends and if I get back to Providence this is a definite stop.
June 12, 2015|Federal Hill|5|We don't dine at Siena regularly, but have been enjoying it since they opened this location. The food was excellent. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband had the Veal Saltimboca. I started with the fig salad special and my husband started with the cesear salad. The martini's were just as we enjoy them and the wine by the glass selection was excellent. Our waitress was very knowledgable and personable , as well. We finished our meal with a gelato selection . Always enjoy Siena and look forward to our return.
June 12, 2015|enjoyed the atmosphere,  great service ....|4|enjoyed the atmosphere, great service . wonderful waiter and good food. overall a good experience.
June 12, 2015|Great Italian meal|4|A few of us went to Siena for dinner and we all loved out food. Tagliatelle Bolognese was good (not as good as last month's order, but still delicious) Chicken Parm was nicely done and moist Chicken alla Milanesa, was good and crisp, but a bit dry on the inside Gnocchi al Forno, nice and creamy. Very good choice in Providence on Federal Hill
June 11, 2015|All-around fantastic meal|5|"From appetizers through main course, our party of 4 adults had a fantastic meal which was reasonably priced. We started by sharing calamari and an heirloom tomato salad. Both very good and not too heavy, but plenty to share. Bread at the table was fresh and delicious. We had a hard time choosing from the entrees, as they all looked good. We decided to go ""family style"": each of us chose a meal and we split them between the 4 of us. We had a shrimp and risotto dish, a seafood special (shrimp, scallops, lobster, salmon over pasta w/a light sauce), veal scallopini and a steak w/Gorgonzola sauce. We agreed that all meals were outstanding. Nothing went unfinished. Beginning with the ease of making reservations on OpenTable, the complementary valet, the pleasant and attentive service and finally the wonderful meal, we had a great overall experience. I can't speak about the wine, as none of us are wine drinkers. I also can't testify about dessert, as we were too full to consider it. The couple we dined with are dear friends from the Midwest. It was our first time to Siena and their first time to Providence. After dinner, we wandered over to the courtyard with the fountain and had a drink while listening to live music. The evening was a great success!"
June 11, 2015|Will Miss Siena When We Move to Hilton Head|5|My wife and I will be moving to Hilton Head this fall. Besides family and friends, one of the things we will miss most is dining at Siena before we go to PPAC for a show. Siena's food is outstanding. But for those of us that frequent Siena often, it is not just the same old menu. They always have numerous interesting and delicious specials, including appetizers, meat, and fish. I wish we could take Siena restaurant with us to Hilton Head!!
June 6, 2015|Terrific food/bad atmosphere|3|Such a shame that with such great place for service and food that this owner allows his place to become a sports bar. The noise was unbearable. My party couldn't hear ourselves talk or think. I was a regular with the previous owners who ran an elegant and classic place to eat. Now the dress code brings in people dressed like beach bums. On a Saturday night? How sad to destroy what would otherwise be a fabulous place to spend an evening.
May 31, 2015|Satisfied, not impressed|3|I expected the food to be more interesting. E.g., fried calamari with drizzled balsamic vinegar?
May 31, 2015|The waitress was super sweet|5|We come to Siena a couple times a year and it is always delicious. We had the sweetest waitress who seemed to genuinely be a nice person and seemed to love her job. She was very helpful with our 1 year old. I wish I knew her name, but she was a keeper!
May 30, 2015|Exquisite|5|First time diner. What a gem! Server, Tatiana was wonderful - professional, knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. Every piece of food I put into my mouth made me want to sing with delight! Truly it was one of the best meals I have had and I LOVE to eat! I live for my next visit. Perfect in every way!

May 22, 2015|Good food, fantastic service|4|The food was delicious and the service was excellent! We went on a Friday evening and good thing we had reservations - the restaurant was very busy. Party of four - everyone enjoyed their meal.
May 19, 2015|Sienna - Dining that always satisfies|5|I can always count on Sienna for fabulous dining experience with Tuscan preparation that is imaginative, tasteful, and consistently good every time I go. There is always a creative appetizer to try which is not something I would make at home. On this evening it was the grilled asparagus with goat cheese and prosciutto ---delicious! I love that there are a fine selection of pastas as well as a variety of fish, veal, chicken, and beef dishes. It makes it possible to bring new friends to the restaurant knowing everyone will find something to their taste. Service is attentive and staff go out of their way to make sure you are pleased with the experience.
May 17, 2015|Excellent food with amazing service and atmosphere|5|"I will without a doubt be back here if/when I find myself in RI again! The food- from presentation to taste to portion size- was excellent! And what you get for the price is mind blowing. From the moment you walk in, you think ""5 star expensive restaurant""...the setting, the atmosphere, the staff, EVERYTHING makes you feel top notch immediately. Then you sit down to look at the menu and it's wonderful. (5 STAR EVERYTHING AT A 3 STAR PRICE). Our waitress was amazing as well. She was VERY knowledgeable of the menu, as well as the wines. The hostesses were awesome. We had originally made a 6:30 reservation, but due to work we weren't going to make it. I called to push it back but the next closest availability was 8:00pm, so I took it. We got to the hotel, showered, and then to the restaurant about 7:15...thinking 'if there's no available dining room seating, maybe there's open seating at the bar or on the patio'. I told the hostess our situation, she said ""no problem"", and had us at a table within a few minutes!! Another WOW moment. If you've read this far down on my review, I've said all that to say one thing- ""I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone, and I'll definitely be back"". Everything was excellent"
May 16, 2015|Great desserts, sorbet, veal chop, antipasti|5|They went totally out of their way for my wife who needed gluten free and otherwise restricted foods. The attention to her needs was fabulous. The assortment of really fine cheeses, fish, salamis, was impressive. Great service.
May 11, 2015|Great Place for Special Occasion Dinner|4|The food was very good and priced reasonably. We arrived early and didn't have to wait to be seated. The staff was very nice.

May 10, 2015|Joe|5|The veal my friend was excellent probable best ever. The shrimp were also excellent as always. The chocolate on chocolate on chocolate cake with raspberry and chocolate sauce was to die for. Our waitress was excellent.
May 10, 2015|Great Mother's Day|4|It was a wonderful place to spend my Mother's Day lunch. The food selection was great and the ambience was perfect for a family setting. The aroma of good food was apparent the minute you walk in the restaurant. We had the ginormous meatball as a starter along with the fritti calamari. My kids devoured the meatball. I had the Chilean sea bass with scallop sauce; it was devine. Service was very good too - we wanted our girls to split a Caesar salad and the waitress proactively had the kitchen split it before hand. We had dessert too. The velvet cake was superb and my husband devoured the lemon creme brûlée; delicious. So glad we had dessert there versus getting a pint of Ben and Jerry's. Highly recommend for good food, good service, and very nice atmosphere.
May 9, 2015|My husband and I went to Sienna last wee...|4|My husband and I went to Sienna last weekend. My husband had the chicken dish with sausage and I had the Penne Alla Vodka with Shrimp. Prices were reasonable and the food was wonderful We will definitely be going back for a future visit
May 7, 2015|Siena is delicious!|5|We enjoyed a delicious dinner at Siena, Atwells Ave., Providence on Thursday night. The calimari was tender and nicely prepared, our fish entrees fresh and flavorful and the service excellent. Some diners sat outside, however the sidewalk area isn't very large. We would return.
May 5, 2015|Noisy and cold, otherwise excellent|4|If you do not mind high levels of noise and insufferably cold AC (and I had a sweater on), Siena is great in terms of food and service.
April 29, 2015|Great recommendation|5|Delicious food and flavors. Very knowledgeable staff with gluten allergies. Polite and engaging staff
April 27, 2015|Providence Gem|5|This restaurant is a Providence Gem! The service is top notch and the food is exceptional and always fresh.I look forward to returning again for both a romatic evening out or entertaining business clients.
April 19, 2015|Awesome experience|5|Dinner was delicious starting with the recommended wine, the appetizer special (a thin crust pizza) and four extremely satisfied people with they entrees. I requested a quiet table and they accommodated us in the back room. The waitress was delightful. A must for anyone looking for a great Italian meal!
April 18, 2015|Excellent, but loud|4|Food was great, atmosphere nice and server knowledgeable and attentive. Front of the restaurant was loud and aisles were a bit tight in some spots for foot traffic and I got brushed by more than a couple folks passing by, but I had read as such in interviews so I expected it. Not a major issue for me. Will definitely go back. Back of the restaurant seemed to be a little quieter.

April 16, 2015|Fantastic food and service|5|"Due to delays in our evening, we had to keep extending our reservation arrival time, yet when we finally arrived staff was very diligent to get us a table on such a busy evening. Food was exceptionally fine. Waitstaff did a tremendous job. We were made to feel ""like special guests."" All details were covered so professionally. Top quality restaurant!"
April 12, 2015|take out a Brown student or two|5|had a great meal with a granddaughter and two of her friends. friendly service, excellent pasta, reasonably quiet back corner table, flexible staff.
April 12, 2015|Delicious as always!!|5|"Love this restaurant! We were there last week for my mom's birthday and went back this week with a friend. Never had a meal I didn't enjoy! The ""specials"" are the best."

Dined on April 11, 2015|Excellent.|4|Food was excellent. Service great. Noise level was a bit high. We celebrated a birthday and a they presented dessert beautifully. Highly recommend this restaurant.

April 10, 2015|Good food, vibrant,energetic vibe|4|Ate on a Friday night, crowded, energetic vibe. Had a reservation, actually was seated early. Service attentive. Food was very good. Eggplant appetizer 3 pieces enough to share with 3 people. Salad with candied nites and dates was excellent. Main dishes were good.
April 9, 2015|Great dining experience.|5|Great food selection, preparation, presentation, quality and value. Entertained business associates from MidWest who thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We'll be back.

April 8, 2015|Great food large portions|5|This was a wonderful experience. The food was great with plenty of it. The staff work really hard to make sure that you had a pleasant time. I can't wait to go back.
April 8, 2015|Enjoyed Dinner|4|We arrived a party of 7, however, mistakenly the reservations were for 6. The staff was able to quickly modify the table to accommodate 7 seamlessly. Our server arrived quickly and we were off for a great evening of food and drink. Our group went to a comparable venue the night before and happily I noted Siena's more moderate pricing with the same portions and exceptional taste. I will return and will recommend Siena to others.
April 7, 2015|Energetic and enjoyable|4|Food was very good, reservation honored on time. Downside was the server - constantly in our face, wanting us to order, finish, and get out. That's how we felt. Eat and give us our table back ASAP.
April 7, 2015|Wonderful gem in Federal Hill|5|Excellent service and Italian cuisine. The short rib was delicious and tender. The giant meatball was a fun appetizer. If you like things spicy, don't forget to ask for the red pepper oil. Enjoy!
April 3, 2015|Great food but slow service.|4|The food was excellent. Presentation was fantastic. Very yummy! Decor and atmosphere were very nice. Wait staff were very attentive. Five stars on the food, atmosphere, and wait staff but it took 65 minutes for the food to arrive. If we were having lots of drinks before our meal, the wait would be fine but that wasn't the case. Except for the very slow service, this restaurant was excellent. Great place to socialize and have a few drinks and a great meal. Not so good if you walk in the door hungry.
April 2, 2015|first time|5|For our first time there it was great. Great food great people and we would definitely be back
March 30, 2015|Excellent Italian food on the Hill|5|Siena has become one of my favorite restaurants in Providence. The service is impecable. Very knowledgeable servers, very polite and very happy to be working there. The wine list is very good, including full bottles, half bottles and glasses. I loved their Beef Short ribs last time I was there. They were tender, flavorful, delicious. Served over a creamy risotto. I have also tried their Frutti di Mare. Absolutely perfect. All seafood items were cooked to perfection and the pasta was cooked al dente. Check it out ! You won't be disappointed.
March 24, 2015|Terrific dinner|4|Loved the food and the service was wonderful. My friend and I met for lunch and loved it.
March 22, 2015|Hit it out of the park|5|The appetizer, Aroncini was great. Three of us each had a different salad, all were awesome. The veal chop was perfection, the shrimp alla vodka was the best we have had and the cioppini was brilliant. Michelle was a delight, she was very attentive without being pushy, her recommendations were spot on and her sense of humor made the experience so much more pleasant. She is truly a wonderful, professional server that knows how to make people feel special. We have eaten at many establishments on Federal Hill. Sienna is the best.
March 21, 2015|We shall return.|4|Siena is a lively venue with a good selection of Northern Italian dishes. My wife had the Brasato, which was extremely tender and the flavor was very good. I had the Saltimboca. The veal was tender and the portion was ample. However, the taste that came thru was dominated by the sweetness of the San Marsano tomato sauce and did not allow the saltiness of the procuitto and the fresh taste of the basil to come thru. We finished with desserts and cappacino that were excellent. Overall a very good dining expierence.
March 21, 2015|Our waitress was wonderful|5|Excellent food wonderful spot, great presentatiion
March 17, 2015|unbelievable dinner|5|Just an unbelievable dinner- had the large meatball-just terrific- also had beet salad- fresh and tasty- bolognese best in the world and veal that was tender and didnt need a knife- just a fantastic meal- best waitress ever- TIA-- thank you so much
March 15, 2015|Excellent Find|5|Found Sienna on line and it was everything I expected and more. The service was excellent....and the Winter Sangria was soooo good. Lots of interesting menu items and drinks. The appetizers are so different and plentiful that they could be ordered as a main course with one of the great salad offerings. Lots of great main courses (on menu and additional items each day) to choose from. The dessert selection was great and the coffee and dessert drinks were so interesting it was hard to know which ones to select. A place I am looking forward to going to again in the future.
March 12, 2015|Last minute late dining|5|I was in town for work and met a friend for dinner. We heard from 3 different people randomly this was a good place to go. It wasn't good...it was Great! From beginning to end it was a great experience. The Branzino was fantastic and we paired it with a Banfi Chianti. It was perfect.
March 10, 2015|Excellent service, our waiter was friend...|4|Excellent service, our waiter was friendly, well informed and was comfortable making suggestions. Well rounded menu and ample portions at prices that are reasonable for Federal Hill. We sat in the front of the restaurant which was very vibrant, a little noisy but lively. The back of the restaurant seemed a little quieter but for a Tuesday night, the entire restaurant was very busy. We were not rushed at all and the food was delicious! I'd go back! I did mention in my reservation on open table that it was my wife's birthday, but no mention was made of that at all....a little disappointed in that.
March 10, 2015|michelle our waitress was fabulous!|5|Great food which was complimented by great service. Cozy atmosphere.
March 10, 2015|Excellent Experience|5|Came here for a birthday dinner BEFORE the 3/10 Neil Diamond concert. service was impeccable and food was right on. I would go back just for a meal. We each had something entirely different and everything was wonderful; a shrimp dish, a chicken dish and a pasta dish. If in Providence definitely try!
March 9, 2015|Wonderful dining experience!|5|we were in town on business and looking for a new place to try, as we usually do. We found Siena on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, service, and most notably, the food! 3 of us ordered different dishes and each one exceeded our expectations! Next time I'm in Providence, I'm returning to Siena. There are many more things I want to try!
March 7, 2015|sienna|4|very friendly staff, good food, waitress with a great sense of humor, attentive, entertaining, and with patience ordering the food, thank you theresa, coming in to the restaurant we where greeted by samantha in the friendliest way.
March 7, 2015|Amazing Experience|5|Siena is a wonderful dining atmosphere, reservations are taken right on time and you're definitely not rushed to order or hurry and leave. Went here for my boyfriends birthday dinner. The menu is delectable, had the fried calamari which was perfect, clean oil and not overly fried. Best I've ever had~ He had the Tagliatelle Marsala Pasta special and I had the Brasato; followed by a slice of Chocolate torte AMAZING! I highly recommend this restuarant to anyone.
March 6, 2015|Awesome|5|Couldn't have chosen a better place. The food was awesome and outr server Michelle was great!
March 3, 2015|Great food and service|5|The menu is diverse, with a variety of distinctive dishes. No matter what mood I'm in, I could find something appealing to eat here. The food is delicious and our server was friendly and attentive. This was our second meal here but not our last. The noise level was somewhat loud but I'm losing my hearing and maybe it was just me.
February 28, 2015|Best Italian Restaurant in RI|5|Fabulous. There is no other word that comes to mind.
February 27, 2015|Perfect!|5|My girlfriend is gluten sensitive and our waitstaff was knowledgable and accommodating . Her food was outstanding in flavor and the wine selection of the day a delight!
February 27, 2015|Would like to try another time...|3|We were requested a quiet table and were told we would be seated at one in the back which would be quiet. Our table was next to a large birthday party which was loud. The food was good so I'd like to try it again.
February 17, 2015|Had a great dinner at Siena with my daug...|4|Had a great dinner at Siena with my daughter. She had short ribs and loved them. I had a veal chop and it was one of the best I've had anywhere. Our server was attentive without being overbearing.
February 17, 2015|Excellent pre-theater choice|5|"We went to Siena for dinner before going to the theater at Trinity Rep. I mentioned our evening plans in my Open Table reservation request. The service staff was amazingly kind and attentive, we had a perfectly timed dinner, leaving plenty of time to get to the theater but never feeling rushed. They even hoped that we ""enjoy the show!"" as we were leaving. But Siena does not just have great service, it has excellent food. I had the most perfect, tender, flavorful filet mignon and my husband had an excellent salmon special entree. Although the restaurant was full it was not noisy (the bar scene out front is lively, the restaurant is cozier) so we could enjoy our conversation. We will definitely return!"
February 15, 2015|Excellent|5|Excellent Italian Food... Seafood, steaks, pasta, anything ! Stop by for a great meal.
February 14, 2015|Valentine Blizzard|5|The restaurant was very accommodating of our reservation changes on this very busy night. Our server, Mellissa, couldn't have been better and the food was simply fantastic!
February 11, 2015|Wonderful food and service.  Noise level...|4|Wonderful food and service. Noise levels may interfere with conversation if you are seated at the front of the restaurant in the bar area.
February 7, 2015|Service was professional and friendly. M...|5|Service was professional and friendly. My inly complaint: everything looked so good on the tables around me but I could only eat one dinner! Haha. Great place for food in a city known for great food!
January 29, 2015|Siena did it again|5|Fantastic meal. The meatball app is a meal by itself. If you want a quiet meal ask for a table in the back. Goes well with Ferrari Carano Siena. Not related.

January 28, 2015|Great Italian|5|Excellent food, service and ambiance. The braised short rib pizza was amazing and could be an entire meal
January 25, 2015|Great Food|5|Excellent food, great atmosphere, excellent service, overall great dining experience.
Dined on January 24, 2015|Everything here is....|5|One of the best places on federal hill to eat. The food is beyond delicious ! We had Susan as our server. She was wonderful ! I highly recommend this restaurant !!
January 24, 2015|disappointing|2|crowded, long wait time even with reservation; standing around in the doorway: nowhere to wait; restaurant week menu only fair to poor (calamari excepted) normal fare (a la carte) usually better, but the other problems seem to be endemic, valet parking quite efficient the only bright spot was the waitress: pleasant, gracious,informative and prompt less so the reception people: always on the prowl to see who is ready to leave!
January 24, 2015|I was granted a meal not on the menu. Veal Fran.|5|Veal franchesee was amazing. Martinis are deliciously fun.
January 23, 2015| great dinner|5|Service was great! Food delicious and atmosphere cozy.
January 23, 2015|Outstanding!|5|Great Restaurant Week deal with three pretty substantial courses for $29.95. Started with creative cocktails: fig martini; and arch martini (pineapple infused vodka w/ basil & St. Germain). Both were different and refreshing. Appetizers of pear salad and balsamic calamari were both delicious. Calamari was cooked perfectly and the balsamic glaze was a welcome change of pace from traditional RI Calamari. I would have appreciated tentacles and not just rings. Main courses of Pappardelle Bolognese and grilled Salmon on Lobster Risotto were both tremendous. Bolognese was hearty but not heavy. Salmon and Risotto were both executed nicely. Double chocolate tart was absolutely decadent and pumpkin bread pudding/cake was an unexpected star of the show. Our server had a good knowledge of most of the menu and staff was quick to fill water glasses and replace napkins. I've had great dining experiences at both Siena on Federal Hill and at the Smithfield location. They never disappoint.
January 21, 2015|Great as always|5|One of the best antipastos in town and the bolognese is amazing. Great wine list too!
January 17, 2015|Second Visit to Siena|3|"This was my second time to Siena and I was not as impressed as I had been the first time I went. We arrived at 5:30 thinking that would give us plenty of time for an 8pm show. Our server was friendly and the ""manager"" helpful with directions to PPAC. We had an appetizer, salad and dinner. Don't know if the server forgot to order our dinner after we had our appetizer and salad or if the kitchen dropped the ball but dinner did not get to our table until close to 7:30. Even a table that came after we had our appetizer and salad got served their dinners before us. No one explained or apologized for the delay with our meals getting to the table. The veal scallopine was a small portion and luke warm while the other dinner was piping hot, a seafood pasta dish. I think the veal was sitting in the kitchen window getting cold while the seafood pasta dish was being cooked. We really wanted dessert and an after dinner drink but there was no time as we had to rush to the theatre. Prior to going there, we had tried to change the reservation to 6pm thinking 5:30 would be too early and thank goodness we couldn't be accommodated. In addition, our table was set tightly in a corner too close to another table and there was a very cold draft above the table. Overall the meals were decent but the time it took for us to get our meal was way too long."
January 16, 2015|Pleasantly surprised!|5|My first time dinning at Siena in Providence RI was a pleasant surprise. The service was excellent and the food amazing. I was most surprised by the Salmon over risotto with lobster. It was amazing. The veal was tender and delicious but the Salmon over risotto stole the show. I highly recommend this restaurant and their delicious Salmon over risotto dish. It was a great dinning experience. We will eat at Siena in Providence RI again.
January 16, 2015|Restaurant week|5|We had reservations for xs inert and it happened to be restaurant week! What a delicious meal! Service was fantastic and the atmosphere was cozy for a nice winter night out! The manager and server went out of their way to make our 8 year old Feel welcome! Finding markers and paper and even giving her a cute pink sienna hat! Thank you sienna!
January 10, 2015|Molto buono!!|4|I was taken to Siena for my birthday. I chose it because I liked the variety of vegetarian options which are not found in typical Italian restaurants and limit vegetarians to all basic pasta dishes or just salads. I had many items from which to choose but ordered three sides and a Bibb salad (nightly special) and all of it was delicioso! My martini was made perfectly to order and was poured right in front of me from a personal-sized shaker, so I know it was not sitting on the bar out in the open where the gin could breathe out before being served to me. Very nice. Michele was our waitperson and she was timely, polite, and appropriately attentive. I was also impressed to see a restaurant where tables are swept between courses. You just do not see that any more (unless one goes to a really, really expensive place and sometimes even they don't do that). They have a coat check. The parking valets were prompt and polite. The only very minor downsides were: Our particular table location. I did not like sitting in a chair opposite the end of a booth where a) I could see directly in to the kitchen and b) where it was at the opening to the rest of the street-side dining room so wait staff were constantly moving right past me. The air temperature of the restaurant kept fluctuating rather noticeably as people would put coats (if they had with them) on, then off, then on again, etc. Still, neither of these downsides are significant enough to detract from the wonderful evening!! I have already mentioned the great experience to several people and I will be back. Mille grazie! Molto buono!!
January 3, 2015|Birthday dinner|5|We went away for week-end and chose Providence for our Sat-Sun stay and going to an Italian restaurant on Federal Hill was our 1st. choice. Had reservation and were seated immediately upon arriving . Within minutes we had dish of olives and bread on table and drink order placed. Nick, our server was polite, efficient and knowledgeable, very pleasant. Pasta Fagiole excellent, Risotto creamy, decadent comfort food, breaded chicken w/lemon just right, husband's pasta Bolognese one of the best ever had, perfect.
December 31, 2014|Happy New Year|5|Consistently the best on the hill. Appetizers are always a treat, the menu has plenty to choose from and there are always some great specials to surprise.
December 31, 2014|Always a great experience!|5|Very friendly and welcoming staff from owner/manager, hostess, coat check to waitress. Despite it being New Year’s Eve and very busy they were able to accommodate our table request. Food, as always, was fresh and delicious from apps to dinner to dessert. I recommend Siena to everyone. It’s our favorite restaurant. Someday I’ll venture out to one of their other locations but the Federal Hill location is always so great I always return.
December 31, 2014|Always get the best meals and the best service.|5|We have been going to Siena for a decade and have never had anything but a 5 star experience. They know how to do it right and are most consistent. It's a can't miss.
December 21, 2014|Siena....worth a visit!|5|Our son was arriving home via the Amtrack train to Providence on Sunday night....train was late and I had to reschedule my reservation time twice! The woman I dealt with on the phone was lovely and very accommodating. We finally arrived and were seated at a table in the bar area near a window. It was a nice spot but a little chilly as I had to keep putting my scarf on during dinner. Also, it was a little difficult to hear due to a very loud table of gentleman next to us. Next time I would request a table in the back...a quieter part of the restaurant. Our waitress was attentive and very pleasant.....she did a great job. Our food was excellent. The short ribs over risotto was delicious and my son cleaned up his entire plate of butternut squash ravioli. My husband loved the veal saltimbocca while my other son had the tagliatelle ragout. He said it was good but a little greasy. Dessert was an excellent chocolate mousse cake and an apple bread pudding...very yummy. We had a very nice evening at Siena and would return again. We also loved the valet parking on a cold winter night. Everyone we encountered at Siena was professional and friendly.
December 14, 2014|Siena Siena|5|Our annual trip to see the Christmas Carol is always followed by dinner on the Hill. Siena has never disappointed.
December 13, 2014|Delicious food every visit|4|We had a wonderful dinner on our second visit to Sienna. However, this time we were seated in the front of the restaurant and it was too noisy. Next time I will request a seat in the back.
December 12, 2014|Food was delicious and service was excellent|5|We asked for to sit in the back, away from bar, because it's quieter and hostess graciously fulfilled our request!
December 9, 2014|Excellent food, thoroughly enjoyed this ...|5|Excellent food, thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.
December 7, 2014|First time to Siena...|5|Found it on a whim...and it WOW'd us! Hoping to go back again.
December 6, 2014|Expected more|2|We chose Siena as a last christmas dinner with friends. It was a bad choice. Our waiter was super ambivalent towards our needs. He walked past our table without noticing our drinks were empty, and our plates were finished. It took fifteen minutes to get his attention. The food was okay, we expected more of the Milanese plate, but the chef special on Sunday night was well prepared.
November 30, 2014|Amazing|5|The food, service and price was amazing. Cannot wait to go back. I highly recommend this restaurant.

It felt thrown together to accommodate an additional party. The hostess was fantastic, however, and without missing a beat found us a gorgeous window seat instead! I did see at least one other party reject this table, though, and I wonder if it might be better to get rid of it?
November 29, 2014|Fabulous Food!|5|This place is phenomenal. My boyfriend had the bolognese and it was amazing. I had the Chilean sea bass which just melted in my mouth. No complaints- we really enjoyed it!
November 26, 2014|A favorite for foodies|5|I enjoyed dinner here for the first time with a friend who is a concierge at a high-profile hotel in Boston. For work, she checks out the best restaurants in the city, and I always make eating somewhere new part of my travels wherever I go. We agreed that we would hold the food here up against many of our favorites—anywhere. The server was attentive without being intrusive, and the atmosphere was upscale but very warm. We will definitely visit again.
November 25, 2014|Finally|4|We have recently been revisiting restaurants on federal Hill and have been very disappointed in several that used to be favorites. Siena was the exception. Both veal and pasta dishes were very good. The back room was good for quiet conversation compared to the really LOUD bar scene.
November 25, 2014|First Timer|4|"First time to Providence. Went to ""Little Italy"" on recommendation of a niece, and to this particular restaurant on recommendation of the hotel. We were very pleased with both. Had appetizers and dinner but no dessert. The three of us were pleased"
November 23, 2014|Good dinner|4|Enjoyed our first visit. Good good. Wine selection good eith reasonable or better prices. Karen our waitress was a real pro.
November 22, 2014|Not a bad place to dine but better choices near by|3|This restaurant has a nice atmosphere with classic decor. Very good wait staff and manager was on top of food allergy concerns. Menu had decent amount of choices and wine list was good. One of our party of four had a Saturday night special, pistachio encrusted tuna that was very bland and was a little over cooked leaving it a bit dry. More rare would have helped but the lack of flavor was evident. The rest of our party found the food good but lacking in creativity. Fruitti Di Mare was good but not great. I would have liked to taste a little more fresh seasoning in our dishes. Conversely the antipasto looked great but we found the salami and prosciutto extremely salty. Best items of the night: the beet salad (excellent flavors and freshness), the Pumpkin Chessecake and Chocolate Torte Cake accompanied by outstanding cappucinos. I eat in restaurants on Federal Hill about 10 to 12 times a year. I'd rate Siena overall as a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. Although it wasn't a bad experience I would probably recommend 4 other restaurants in the area that I've found the food to be superior.
November 21, 2014|Great service, awesome food and quick valet|4|Excellent food and our server was very knowledgeable, the Espresso martini is a must.
November 14, 2014|Fantastic Every Time|5|My wife and I think this is the best spot on the Hill. The food never disappoints, service adaptable (chatty when you want, invisible when you don't) and always friendly, and the food is incredible. I did note this last time much of the menu has remained unchanged in quite some time which was a bit disappointing, but the meatball appetizer was there, so we were happy. That all being said, get the steak with the garlic. :)
November 14, 2014|Nice!!|4|During our trip to Providence we came across a list of restaurants and we chose this one. It was on a street with a few other restaurants but it wasn't that hard to find. We were delighted with the service and food. If there was one thing to change it would be that the tables in the front room are a bit cluttered. Overall awesome restaurant! We'll be back!!
November 9, 2014|Joe|5|Food and service were outstanding. We both had fish dinners which were superb.
November 9, 2014|Loved this place!|5|Was recommended to us to try while visiting Providence. Food and ambiance was great. Definitely will be a go to place if we come back.
November 7, 2014|from out of town|4|Ai great find and if we ever returned from pa would go again
November 7, 2014|Authentic Italian|5|A great find on Federal Hill! This was the first time I have been to Siena, but I will be back. We had excellent service, and an amazing meal. I dare say my pasta entree was one of the best dishes I have ever had; I kept eating even after I was full, just because it was so good. I would definitely recommend dining here.
November 2, 2014|Successful early dinner|5|I had to catch a flight, so we had a 3:00 dinner reservation. So many things on the menu sounded good, so we ordered too much food, but everything tasted really great. The meatball appetizer and salads were probably my favorite part of the meal, but my whole family was raving about their entrees too. Our waitress was very attentive and did everything perfectly. Even with our early reservation, the restaurant filled up quickly, but service and ambiance didn't suffer.
November 1, 2014|Will return|4|The food at Siena was fabulous. It was our first visit, and we ordered a delicious cheese pizza, Caprese salad, veal and desserts. The bar drinks and wine were amazing. We will definitely return again. Some friends of ours recommended Siera, so we drove down from the New Bedford area and it was well worth the drive. Making registrations online was easy and the staff called us back promptly to confirm. The valet parking was a breeze.
November 1, 2014|absolutely amazing|4|One of the best restaurants I have been to in New England
October 27, 2014|A bit loud, but great food|4|My husband's swordfish and our salads were excellent, but the booth seating was uncomfortable and at times I felt like I was yelling to be carry on a conversation across the table.

October 26, 2014|Great restaurant!|5|First visit to Siena,we had a great experience,the server was awesome and the food was delicious.We live in a different state but would drive to the restaurant to have dinner again!
October 25, 2014|A bit cramped, but a wonderful meal|4|Had anniversary dinner this past Saturday at Siena. It was very loud, and a bit cramped, but...the food was excellent!! Highly recommend the big meatball for an appetizer, and of course dough boys with ice cream and homemade Nutella for dessert!! I had the best swordfish I've ever had, and my girlfriend's gluten allergy was accomadated. Bottle of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc for $30!!! Great time, great meal, great anniversary! Thanks Siena Providence!
October 25, 2014|Delicious|5|My friend and I went to Siena to celebrate a birthday. The place was packed, thank God I made a reservation. Excellent service! My friend got the veal chop and raved about it. Said it was one of the best meals he had. I had the braised short ribs. Melted in your mouth. It was noisy as other reviews had noted, but we were able to have a conversation without yelling. Would always recommend.
October 24, 2014|good food|5|The food was very good. The restaurant was quite busy when we arrived and they sat us at our table on time per our reservation. I would definitely go back to Siena the next time I'm in Providence.
October 24, 2014|We'll  Be Back!|5|Siena was excellent! We were pleased from beginning to end. We went to celebrate my daughter's nineteenth birthday; we'll go back to celebrate finding it.
October 23, 2014|Excellent|5|This restaurant is an absolute must to try. It was my first time eating there and it was great. The food is excellent, the staff is great and very attentive.
October 23, 2014|Favorite Federal Hill Restaurant|5|My favorite restaurant when I visit Providence. I enjoyed the Sea Bass in the past and the specials are usually great.
October 22, 2014|Everything simply amazing|5|This is a definite favorite Service was amazing as well as the staff. Definitely recommend
October 22, 2014|Siena Providence|5|Delicious. Outstanding food. Great service. A little pricey, but worth it and a great place for special occasions.

Everyone ordered different items off the menu and all of us really enjoyed our meals. We live close to the North End in Boston and felt this restaurant was on the same par if not better than some found in the North End.
October 20, 2014|Oct 14|5|Food was delicious, pizza was awesome and service was stellar
October 19, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|After a couple of table changes, at our request, my wife and I settled into a very nice table and enjoyed an excellent anniversary dinner.
October 19, 2014|Worth the trip to Providence|4|Would definitely come back again. Food was very good, especially the calamari aceto balsamico appetizer I had.
October 18, 2014|A Winner|4|"First visit to Providence Siena, though we have eaten at the East Greenwich restaurant many times. We were greeted promptly by the hostess, who went out of her way to ensure we would receive the ""best"" table available, and she was right. The short ribs were outstanding as was the rest of the food enjoyed by our group of four. Desserts are great, generous cups of lemon crème brulee were especially noteworthy."
October 18, 2014|Outstanding experience|5|We will be back! Amazing waitress whom was knowledgeable and expressly attentive made for a terrific time.
October 17, 2014|Siena never disappoints---the Involtini ...|5|Siena never disappoints---the Involtini and Fichi are especially good and for me the Tagliatelle. It was our favorite restaurant when we lived on the West Side. Now going back there seems like such a treat that it's hard to imagine mixing it up by returning to any of our other favorite haunts.
October 16, 2014|Siena is Best on Federal Hill|4|My wife and I have season tickets at PPAC, and always eat on Federal Hill before going to the theater. We have tried many of the restaurants on Federal Hill. But we have now stop looking for new restaurants, and have made Siena our restaurant of choice. Food is always great. They have different and interesting specials each time we eat there. Service is good. Prices are reasonable. Appetizers and desserts (especially the tiramisu) are wonderful. We just love Siena!
October 16, 2014|Great food as always!|5|Four of us dined here before a show at PPAC and enjoyed our meals. The calamari appetizer was a little tasteless. The hot peppers came on the side and the fried squid rings were white. That's not how calamari is usually served but we ate it anyway. Two of us had salads and both were very good! The dinners consisted of two veal dishes, one swordfish and one short ribs. We ate every crumb! Very tasty! The service was good. They were aware that we were trying to make a show but they didn't rush us - just kept the meal moving along.
October 11, 2014|Good Job|5|Had folks in from out of town for a classic PVD night (waterfire, federal hill, etc) Sienna did not disappoint great food, excellent waitress
October 11, 2014|First time there great food and service ...|5|First time there great food and service our waitress Michelle was excellent as were the hostesses res. was for 7pm and we were seated on time will go there again
October 11, 2014|First timer|5|The restaurant was very busy Saturday evening but accommodated my request for a table in the back room, which is quieter and allows for easier conversation. The food was great as advertised (best of RI list for several years). I will definitely return.
October 10, 2014|great place to dine|4|The food was great,service excellent ,the,only reason I did not give five stars overall seating was tight my friend chair was constantly being bumped. Overall. Great dining experience
October 9, 2014|still a favorite|4|front of restaurant's noise level makes it difficult to have a conversation, so ask for the back- which is much more comfortable. Food was very good, Seafood was cooked perfectly,as was risotto and and the bread pudding is best ever. Will return soon.
October 8, 2014|Consistently excellent|5|Our party of 6 shared a few yummy apps and had delicious entrees of veal, shrimp, salmon, steak, chicken. ALL excellent.
October 5, 2014|Only So-So|3|"On this particular Sunday night, the experience and food were certainly good, but it didn't knock me out of my socks as I was expecting from 'the best in Providence"". And as for getting a cab back downtown? Forget about it! Not a cab town, and no help from Sienna."
October 3, 2014|We have gone to Siena a few times, and e...|5|We have gone to Siena a few times, and each time it gets better and better. Me and my girlfriend went for our our anniversary the first time the attention to detail was amazing. They always remember and without request the write Happy Anniversary on the desert plate. Something so simple goes along way. Alex was our waiter twice and is always on point and squared away. The owners and managers along with the rest of the crew are very attentive. Best restaurant in Federal Hill.
October 3, 2014|Did not live up to hype|3|good but not great Italian restaurant. Antipasto plate was average. Entrees good to very good. Desserts amazing. Service excellent. I would recommend this restaurant with the caveat that one should not expect this to be a meal you will remember for very long.
October 1, 2014|Try for a table in back. Where we were i...|4|Try for a table in back. Where we were in front it was very noisy. Service was very good. The food was excellent and that made the evening.
September 29, 2014|Dessert|5|Keep a lot of room for the homemade Tiramisu, best I ever had.. Including Italu
September 27, 2014|The food was very good and our waiter, J...|4|The food was very good and our waiter, Jeff was excellent.
September 27, 2014|Best in Providence|4|Siena is simply best restaurant in Providence. Consistently good food and service at OK proces.
September 27, 2014|Siena|4|Very nice Italian restaurant in Federal Hill area of Providence. Service was very attentive (almost overly), but gave my date a chance to sample the sangria before she ordered a full glass..which she did. We asked for booth instead of a table, and got it. Heirloom tomato salad was very good and was on the 4 specials they had that night. Desert of fried dough with cinnamon sugar and cinnamon gelato was rich and also quite good. Place was full but did not feel noisy nor crowded. My entree of Veal Scallopine with Porcini Mushooms was nicely presented by was bland. The braised short rib that my date ordered was both tender and tasty.
September 26, 2014|The Best|5|The food at Siena is simply magnificent. The only problem is figuring Out what to order because it's all outstanding. I recommend the Branzino or any of the specials. The chef achieves perfection with Every dish!
September 26, 2014|Excellent|5|Food is prepared with creativity and freshness. Service is A plus and the dining room is comfortable and clean. We always go here when we visit the Federal Hill area.
September 25, 2014|Valet is a must|4|First, make sure you take advantage of the valet as parking on Federal Hill is wicked. Secondly, enjoy a drink at the bar as the bar scene is very active. Thirdly, after dinner partake in a espresso. I enjoyed the best latte I have ever had. Plus... All the food is good.
September 23, 2014|very loud|3|The restaurant was very loud, not because it was overcrowded, but because the acoustics in the place are not very good. We were seated at the window, which helped with the noise level. We were there on a Tuesday night with a clientele of a mixed crowd. The food was good with the exception of the calamari, which was very hard, not chewy, but hard.
September 22, 2014|Wonderful|5|We dropped into Providence, working our way back to Boston, after being in Cape Cod and Newport. Scanned the options on Open Table and made rez at Siena. There is a reason, actually lots of them, Siena is so beloved and highly rated. Exceptional food, from the eggplant involtini starter to the dessert special chocolate bread pudding with coffee gelato and caramel sauce. I had the house made ricotta gnocchi Costello, my husband had the bluefish special, both very well executed. If we didn't live in CO, we'd be there weekly! Warm, knowledgeable staff too.
September 20, 2014|Superb|5|Everything was excellent with attention to detail. Reservations made easily on line, they made a follow up phone call to confirm, table was ready early, service, appetizers, food, wine and dessert were all fabulous. Only difficult decision was the menu...everything sounded so good it was hard to decide.
Dined on September 20, 2014|Mixed Bag|3|We rarely eat out on Saturday nights at perhaps otherwise excellent restaurants because of the noise. This was a first visit, and we were disappointed in uneven food and the slow kitchen. Although we were seated right on time and our first course came promptly, we waited almost 45 afterwards for our main. Our waitress was friendly but did not keep us up to date on our next course. The tuna was of excellent quality and well cooked, but the side was undistinguished. My husband's cioppino did not take into consideration cooking times required for the various ingredients, so some things were quite overcooked; the sauce, however, was excellent. All portions were generous.
September 18, 2014|Over Rated|2|This restaurant is very over rated. Food is fair at best. Both the menu and the wait staff misrepresent the actual meal served. Food quality poor. Short rib dish is over cooked two day old pot roast, over extremely over cooked and bland risotto. Calamari is not fresh, it is frozen product. Staff needs to be more attentive, waited very long periods for wine refills and clearing of dishes.
September 15, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|Absolutely perfect. Nothing compares to the food and service.
September 15, 2014|Always great food|5|Each time I go to Sienna I have a wonderful experience. This is true at both of the locations I have been to. I would highly recommend it as a stand out on Federal Hill
September 14, 2014|We were so pleased to find this restaura...|5|We were so pleased to find this restaurant! My husband had the meatball appetizer, and just enjoyed every lick! The portion was huge! I had the fresh fig and prosciutto salad- superb! For entrees, my husband had a luscious veal chop and I had saltimbocca! My husband is very hard to impress, but he thought it was outstanding. I also enjoyed every bite! They were both served with delicious farro and tender crisp green beans. perfect! It is a perfect place for us to dine before heading to trinity Rep! Valet parking and great martinis too!
September 13, 2014|noisy overbooked|1|Our table was next to the bar which was noisy next to patrons standing and a high traffic area. I requested a table in the restaurant not the bar. Isn't that the purpose of a res? Told I had to wait 1 hour. We left with not even a apology. A big disappointment.
September 13, 2014|Way Too Loud!|3|Although the service and menu selection were excellent, the noise level grew to the point where one could hear anything one's dining companion said. It certainly detracted from the enjoyment of what was probably a delicious meal. This occurred in the front room early Saturday evening. Cannot imagine how much louder it must have gotten as the evening wore on. Servers should receive hazardous duty pay! Too bad they cannot be issued ear protection gear!
September 12, 2014|Amazing food, amazing service!|5|My fiance and I came here for a nice dinner in the city and was not disappointed. We were a little early for our reservation so we had a drink by the bar to wait. The kitchen has an open view area and we were in awe at how in sync they were and how quickly everything was produced! Every dish they were bringing out looked incredible. We were seated on time and we had the little necks on the crustini for an appetizer. It melted in my mouth! For the entree, my fiancee had the Frutii de Marre and he loved it! Ihad the Lobster Mac & Cheese and could have died in peace right there. Our waiter was super nice & the drinks were really well mixed. If I had to pick one thing we didn't love completely, it was pretty loud when we first got there. LOVE!
September 12, 2014|SO SO|3|Calamari and crabcake appetizers were not good -bland. Meal was good. Dessert portions too huge. Very loud atmosphere and the air conditioning was way too cold
September 12, 2014|Fabulous|5|We're from Massachusetts and love the north end of Boston and the wonderful Italian restaurants there. My first time to Federal Hill and first to Siena Restaurant. The food there was fabulous, just as good as what we're used to in the north end of Boston. There were four of us, and we had cocktails, appetizers, wine, main course, coffee and dessert. We all loved everything. Definitely go back again.
September 9, 2014|Food:  outstanding each visit.  Service:...|4|Food: outstanding each visit. Service: outstanding each visit. Noise: very noisy in front room. A/C: much too cool. Tables: too close.
September 7, 2014|Sure bet|5|From the Martinis through appetizers, main course and the fabulous dessert, we loved our experience. The service was professional and friendly. Prices are reasonable. Siena is a good value and is not to be missed.
September 7, 2014|Delicious Federal Hill gem|4|"There are plenty of Italian restaurants to choose from on Federal Hill, but we loved Siena for its cozy warm ambience and more ""nouvelle"" approach to Italian food. The Puglia salad (arugula, roasted beets, walnuts, burrata cheese) was outstanding, and the swordfish with caper sauce was absolutely delicious. We didn't have any pasta or pizza...but we'll be back. Service was good—attentive but not oppressive."
September 6, 2014|Excellent Italian Food|5|We are multiple repeat customers and can vouch for the consistant quality of the food, service. During the many visits to Federal Hill, no matter what time of the year, this establishment is jammed packed and for good reason. The food is OUTSTANDING! Worth more than the prices on the menu if you are accustomed to great Italian Cuisine.
September 6, 2014|Excellent|5|Service, food and ambience! I had lobster stuffed sole, my husband had the seafood pasta special and we finished with a chocolate bread pudding that was the best! Will go back next visit to providence!
September 5, 2014|Excellent & renowned|5|Food was excellent, service too. Wins awards for the right reasons.
August 31, 2014|Amazing Food!|5|When we first walked in I thought it was a little noisy, but we were seated at a table in the back and it was perfect. This was definitely the best dinner of our vacation. Our appetizers, calamari and the baked eggplant parmesan were amazing, the entrees of veal chop and shrimp with risotto were excellent and for dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding that was to die for! Highly Recommend!!
August 31, 2014|A Federal Hill must|5|We have been to Federal Hill many times and had not had the pleasure of eating here before but we will definitely make it a priority to make sure we make reservations ahead of time. There was a lot to choose from on the menu and the specials were to outstanding.
August 31, 2014|We went on a Sunday afternoon for a fami...|4|We went on a Sunday afternoon for a family birthday. My only complaint was it got too cold from the A/C and we couldn't stay for dessert.
August 30, 2014|Delicious meal.|4|Our dinner was delicious with everything very fresh and flavorful: Puglia and Fragole salads, swordfish, seared tuna, and a wonderful tiramisu. The portions were generous Our server was friendly and helpful. Quite a hopping scene. If you want a quiet place to dine this is not it.
August 29, 2014|Federal Hill Virgin|5|Our first time at Federal Hill, Siena along with many other restaurants came highly recommended. Truth be told I picked Sienna because of the tufted red velvet high back booth LOL. The service was the most spectacular we've ever had. Karen was our server and she is amazing. Very knowledgeable about the menu, the wine and the neighborhood and gave us great recommendations for places to check out. The hospitality at Federal Hill blows Boston's North End away (sorry Bawston peeps)
August 25, 2014|Great evening|5|Great food-great service in this Federal Hill gem, albeit a little noisy! It was fully booked when we were there and most of the other restaurants on the street were empty. The food was fabulous-best Caesar salad ever- pasta done to perfection. Reasonably priced and a fun place if you don't mind a little noise from all the happy diners. Dining outside available but right on street so we chose inside.
August 24, 2014|Somewhat disappointed|2|I suggest requesting the dining room in your reservation if this is a special occasion as we were seated in a very loud bar area with a television. We could barely hear our server. Our server was great and the food was good, but not exceptional. The pasta fagioli was more like a bowl of beans than a soup, but had decent flavor. The crab cakes were very good. But my Chilean sea bass tasted less than fresh and our side of asparagus was cold and overcooked. I recommend Pan e Vino over Siena any day of the week.
August 23, 2014|Service great, food just average|3|We started with an artichoke appetizer that had dense stuffing yet somehow was under seasoned and did not come together for us. The rest of our meal was just average, maybe we didn't order their signature items but we did not leave feeling like we wanted to return to try something else.
August 22, 2014|Can't beat it|4|Always a pleasure dining here! The consistency and quality of the food is unbeatable.
August 21, 2014|service was very slow|3|Like thd place when we are in Providence, but this time...waited too long for all
August 21, 2014|Great Dinner!|5|My husband and I decided to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in Providence, RI. After reading over several reviews of Siena Providence, we decided to make a reservation here. We were not disappointed at all. The food was excellent as well as the service. We live in the NY area and have many excellent restaurants. This was a definite recommendation to anyone who wants good food and service.
August 20, 2014|Nice dinner|5|This was our first experience at Siena. The occasion was our 37th wedding anniversary. We made reservations, arrived on time and were seated immediately. Our server was very attentive, had great food and wine knowledge and made recommendations. The food was delicious and fairly priced. The only drawback were the people seated nearby who were rather loud. The evening was very pleasant.
August 20, 2014|Enjoyable evening|5|Met friends and enjoyed crab cake appetizer, veal santimboca, shrimp with risotto. I'd highly recommend all. Bar scene was hopping but we sat in back room. Dark but quiet for conversation. Service was excellent. Overall great experience!
August 19, 2014|Not happy|2|Our waitress was not very friendly and a bit abrupt. We watched other patrons receive silverware with each course. We didn't even have enough silverware. We had guests arrive at our table for a few minutes and at that moment the waitress wanted to take our order - really?
August 15, 2014|Amazing, Once Again|5|This is our second time at Siena Restaurant. The first time was amazing and the second time was just as good. Great bar area and cocktails. The bartenders were very friendly. Our waiter was great. The menu is perfect because it is not 5 pages long. The food is very fresh. I don't usually get meatballs at a restaurant but they have a meatball appetizer with fresh ricotta that is unbelievable. Overall, Siena is outstanding. Can't wait to go back to Providence so I can eat at Siena again.
August 15, 2014|Sienna has it all|4|The rustic Italian food ,the ambiance and the service were all excellent. We will go back soon.
August 12, 2014|Special night|5|Brought my fiancé here after popping the question. They accommodated us beautifully for such a special occasion. Thank you!
August 12, 2014|Wasn't disappointed.|4|Started with the gigantic meatball. It was very tasty. It weighs 16 ounces; we took half of it home. Next was a golden-beet arugula salad. Nicely executed. Our entrees were the Tagliatelle with Bolognese and the Rigatoni. Both were excellent. The Bolognese was a bit heavy on the oil, but had a great flavor. We noticed that Siene was one of the few restaurants to be busy on a Tuesday night. We could tell from the food why that is.
August 9, 2014|I happened upon this restaurant and what...|5|I happened upon this restaurant and what a great find! The food was delicious - I had a wonderful beet salad followed by veal - the presentation was great and taste divine. Our waitress Karen was knowledgeable and excellent! I recommend for everyone to try this find!
August 9, 2014|Dinner before the Fire Show|5|We had an excellent dinner at Sienna--the food was great and our waitress was excellent. The whole atmosphere on Federal Hill is fun and festive. Plus its an easy walk to the Fire Show.
August 8, 2014|Awesome staff, food|5|It was our first time eating in Providence and it was delicious!! Our waitress was very personable and took the time to provide us with exceptional service. It was a very relaxing and romantic atmosphere. The food was delicious and very tasty. We will definitely go back!
August 8, 2014|Disappointing|3|Not because the food or service was bad in any way; only because I had such high hopes. I had heard that Siena was supposed to be, hands down, the best Italian restaurant in Providence. However, what my family and I received was...just good. Not outstanding, just very good. The meatball appetizer was outstanding, as was the Bolognese. However, the short rib entree was just okay and the Saltimbocca was tasteless. I expected one of the best Italian meals of my life, and I feel like what I received I could have gotten at any other restaurant in Federal Hill. If I can't get a reservation at Siena, I would have no problem eating anywhere else, if the food is basically the same, if not better, elsewhere.
August 3, 2014|Terrific!|5|Food was authentic Italian, and delicious! Short ribs over a creamy risotto were tender, flavorful, exceptional, tagliatelle was best I've had. We are planning another trip to providence so we can eat there again.
August 2, 2014|Terrific reataurant|5|This is my favorite restaurant on Federal Hill. Food, service and ambiance are second to none. Sienna is a gem, don't think twice visit it today.
Dined on August 2, 2014|Good Choices - Good Flavor at Siena|4|Siena is a great spot on Federal Hill for Italian food and seafood, but with plenty of choices to satisfy those with a taste for something other than Italian. I really enjoyed the crab and shrimp pappardelle, while my wife enjoyed the Bolognese. Our friends enjoyed the pork chop and the seafood medley, and everyone enjoyed their meal, which were all flavorful and fresh. There is something for everyone at Siena.
August 2, 2014|Great food and service|5|I've chosen Siena for my last 4 special occasions and have not been disappointed. Great food and service. I wish I had the time and money to fine there more often. Hats off to the chefs for preparing such great food.
August 1, 2014|Late night Friday|5|We sat outside and this made dinner more entertaining. Nick was a great server - he joined our conversations as needed, serviced us in a timely manner and wasn't fake.
July 31, 2014|fantastic|5|The food was awesome..the ambiance was so charming. The wait staff was superb. What a great spot to enjoy ones company and not have to worry about the quality of the food. With Valet parking it is the spot for an evening of fun.
July 30, 2014|Highly recommend Siena|5|Visit to Providence for first time. Brown University and then dinner. Brother recommended this restaurant and I am so glad he did. The food, service and atmosphere were perfect. Sea Bass special some of the best food I have had in a long time. Wife ordered a pasta dish that was Rigatoni with sweet sausage and porcini mushrooms. Excellent dish. Wife and I love the energy of the bar area but if noise is a problem simply choose to eat in the back half of the restaurant. Outside looked like a good summer choice. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
July 30, 2014|Overrated|3|I was so excited to finally go here! We sat at a table for 2. So noisy hard to talk. Too tight and no room. Could hear the entire conversation at next table. Sangria was very good. Ordered the giant meatball. Delicious. When food came waiter had to take bread away no room on table. The lobster/seafood dish was ok. The crab cakes were boring. Just wanted to leave. No dessert.
July 27, 2014|We dine here a lot most of the time with...|5|We dine here a lot most of the time with a private group, but when I come with other friends and relatives, I just usually just call and make reservations. This time I used the Open Table to reserved. Using the Open Table was so easy, and can be done anytime with confirmation on email. The food selections are awesome and the foods are marvelous. The staff are always attentive. This is one of our favorite restaurant on Federal Hill.
July 27, 2014|Always good food|5|We have had a variety of food selections here and all the choices have been great...
July 26, 2014|Amazing|5|Everything was top notch. Service and food were incredible. Well worth the hour drive. Will be back soon!!!
July 25, 2014|Awesome|5|Great as it always is! That's why it's voted #1 every year
July 24, 2014|No complaints!|5|Lovely dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday. Excellent service - waiter was always present when needed, and only when needed. Waiter made excellent food and wine pairing recommendations. We both selected from the night's specials - over the top! She had a pasta dish with a Bolongese sause that was to die for. I had a filet mignon. Maybe one of the best I have ever had, literally cut with a fork, melt in the mouth. Nice visit at the table with the owner - appropriately short, but much appreciated. They should show that they care, and he did.
July 23, 2014|Amazing|5|As always Siena never disappoints. Great food, great service and a great staff!!
July 22, 2014|nice variety - very authentic|4|Definitely worth a reservation, as it was delicious. Very energized environment.
July 21, 2014|Ehhh|3|I have to say , not really impressed. My veal saltimbocca had no procuittto and no cheese, i didnt say anything so thats my fault ( i figured it was the way the make it there?) and my wifes gnocchi was missing something ( not an item just lackluster) the martini with pineapple and basil was pretty awesome though
July 19, 2014|Gem on Federal Hill|5|We ordered dinner from the restaurant week menu. The food was delish and very reasonably priced. We noticed that their price for a full bottle of wine was the same as a half bottle of the same wine we ordered at a restaurant we ate at the night before. Service was very attentive but not obtrusive. We had a corner table in a crowded room yet we could hear each other talk just fine. After dinner we strolled just down the street and enjoyed outdoor music and dancing so the location was perfect. We highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion.
July 19, 2014|Gary|2|Appetizer and salad were fine. My entree was not edible. It was seafood boiled in a red sauce the fish was completely dry and tasted of fish. The waitstaff apologized but no compensation was made
July 19, 2014|Luv Luv Luv Siena!!|5|My husband fell upon Siena one night in Providence. This restaurant is the BEST!! Staff are top notch and the food is beyond words!
July 18, 2014|Dining at Siena|5|My family has come here for my Dad's birthday three years not. We love that we all can be seated comfortably. The antipasto is a great size for sharing. The house wine was really great. As always the food was delicious and we were all to full for dessert. I would recommend the restaurant to friends.
July 17, 2014|One of the Best on Federal Hill|4|Visited with a party of six foodies and was not disappointed. Food was fantastic. Service was prompt and friendly. Front bar area can be extremely loud and difficult to hold a conversation. We will visit again but ask to be seated in the rear dining area, hopefully that's a little quieter.
July 17, 2014|LAwvr|5|Great real Italian food. Reminds me of my youth. Every dish was fantastic.
July 16, 2014|Delectable Tuscan meal|5|The food was outstanding from the incredibly delicious calamari aceto balsamico to the eggplant parmigiana and it's savory marinara sauce to the strawberry shortcake. We went for the first time and was fortunate to go for restaurant week which had it's signature dishes available for a 3-course meal for $29.95 - what a yummy bargain! My husband is Italian and pretty much an Italian food snob, so I always hold my breath when we go Italian. Siena far exceeded our expectations and when we are in Providence the next time, we will be making another reservation at Siena.
July 14, 2014|You MUST eat here!|5|A few days to discover Providence and trying different restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner and this was the best place we experienced. The service, the food, the wine; everything was excellent! A good thing this was our last dinner in town or we would have had to go back twice! Congratulations to the entire Siena team on having such an excellent table!!
July 13, 2014|excellent as always|5|Siena never disappoints. From drinks to apps to dinner and dessert. Amazing!
July 12, 2014|Nothing Special|3|"I was with a party of four including a son and his wife from England. We were accepted on time and the hostess was gracious but we were seated right by the entrance door. People were literally standing by our table while waiting for theirs. Conversation was difficult as the rather loud bar was also only a few feet away. I'm sure a different seat would have been better, but the place was pretty full. The food was good, but nothing special. My son had a nice piece of swordfish which he said was good. I had a rigatoni ""special"" which didn't have much taste. I was expecting sausage pieces in it, but it was merely crumbs. The chicken pieces were fine. Wine was good (nice selection) and Jeff (our server) was attentive enough."
July 11, 2014|Great food, great service|4|My fiancé and I came for dinner during restaurant week. The restaurant was very busy and seemed a bit hectic but the hostess appeared calm and friendly at the door. We were seated within minutes and greeted by our server shortly after. Our server was very pleasant and friendly. The food was delicious. We would definitely come back again.
July 11, 2014|Ignore TripAdvisor Poor Reviews|5|Someone is always going to bellyache for some reason about something, I get that, but I'd move on to the next review as it relates to Siena. Dined there on a Friday night during restaurant week. Ever been to a restaurant in Manhattan during restaurant week? Smaller than usual portions. Not Siena; healthy size portions. Great food and great service. Won't even bother to check out a different place next time we are on Federal Hill. Go here, you won't be disappointed!
July 11, 2014|Really great menu for restaurant week. M...|4|Really great menu for restaurant week. My only issue is that it was extra noisy during dinner so it was hard to hear each other and e waitress.

The waitress was friendly and accommodating. The food was very good Italian fare with a nice variety of choices. the clam appetizer was delightful.. I would certainly go again.

July 5, 2014|Missed Shot, But Would Return|3|We had a 9pm on Saturday night, and the front space was rocking. We were seated in the very back room, which was a mixed result. It was nearly a ghost town, so the conversation was good. But we felt forgotten by the staff, which was nice but unaware of the lack of attention to us and our long food wait. The food was quite good, but frankly Andino's the night before was better. I would come back and try the fun room with the bar.
July 5, 2014|The noise level really distracted from e...|3|The noise level really distracted from enjoying our meal
July 1, 2014|nice place to eat|4|food is excellent service staff is very informative, and pleasant
June 30, 2014|Traditional Setting, Fresh Food|4|"I'm occasionally wary of patronizing Italian restaurants in ""Little Italy"" neighborhoods -- the selections and preparations are too often those I had in a child in the 1960s. This wasn't a problem at Siena, where we had our best meal during a 3-day stay in Rhode Island. The place features good ingredients, good recipes, and good preparations. My meal of fried calamari, followed by a chicken entree, was delicious, filling, and a good value. Service was pleasant, the decor not memorable."
June 29, 2014|We were given a gift certificate to Sien...|5|We were given a gift certificate to Siena earlier in the year and loved it. We came back to celebrate a birthday and found it to be just as good as remembered. It is cozy, the décor is simple but very nice, the service is excellent and the food is wonderful. Valet parking makes it so much easier in this busy part of Providence. There is dining outside in the good weather but we still prefer to dine inside and enjoy the ambiance. It is quite a distance for us to travel but well worth the trip.
June 28, 2014|Went on a busy Saturday night. We arrive...|4|Went on a busy Saturday night. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservations, but were seated promptly at a nice window table. Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and how things were prepared. I had the salmon special, my husband had the swordfish, and since we both have a passion for eggplant parm, we split the side dish portion. Everything was phenomenal! We try eggplant parm everywhere, and this was one of the best! The salmon and swordfish were cooked perfectly. Food and service get perfect ratings. Tables are a little too close together for my comfort, and the noise level made conversation difficult, so ambience could be better. All in all, we will be back and would absolutely recommend Siena.
June 28, 2014|Very Nice Meal|4|2nd time here - first was business - 2nd was my wife and kids. Great meal. Pasta Fagioli was fantastic. Desserts rock too.
June 26, 2014|Pick another restaurant|2|The food was extremely disappointing: bland and boring. The portions were large (too large--I couldn't finish and wouldn't have finished even if I'd enjoyed the food). I would have preferred quality over quantity. I will not be returning. I gave the service a three-star because our food took 30-35 minutes to arrive at our table and because the server told us that all of the dishes on the menu were delicious. The decor was pleasant--upscale even.
June 25, 2014|Never Disappoints!|4|We had a wonderful evening. The Siena team was friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Siena remains a good value for a top Federal Hill restaurant.
June 23, 2014|fell short|2|"We asked for things and did not get them. Asked for the fish to be cooked a certain way, and after Davey went to the kitchen and back to assure us the Salmon could be cooked "" blackened"" it came with sauce on it, and not blackened at all. Seemed odd that the waiter claimed he had never heard of fish being cooked blackened as it is very common. Hr also brought me wine that I didn't order and I did not receive the extra crustini I requested on the side of my dish. Just dissapointed. Would love to be refunded so that we could give it another shot."
June 21, 2014|great food|4|great food, good service ....but very noisy coming from the bar next door...
Dined on June 21, 2014|A romantic Italian restaurant!|4|I requested a table with a little privacy, although it was in the back of the restaurant, it wasn't very private, but ok. The waitress, Karen, took great care of us. They served bread and a dish of olives, both were good, but would have been ideal if the bread was warm. We both got the special salad of fresh tomatoes, lettuce, homemade croutons, little onion. It was excellent, but could have used a little more greens. We both enjoyed a veal deal....the veal was so tender, just delicious! However, there was no pasta to accompany the dish (just a few green beans)...pasta was a la carte. They could have put a small portion. Great ambience and nicely decorated. I would highly recommend this restaurant...great for a special occasion!
June 21, 2014|Siena - Very Good Italian|4|Very Good experience. Staff was professional and friendly. Interesting specials menu. Stuffed figs were great. Reasonable prices for an upscale Italian restaurant. I had the seafood with linguine and asked for it spicy. It was very good. Decent wine list; just enough choices. Would go back.
June 20, 2014|Great Night Out|5|The night was our first experience with Siena. It will not be the last. The service was excellent. The food was fantastic, especially the pasta and sauce. The eggplant was cooked the correctly not deep fried and not over cooked.
June 15, 2014|Great food at reasonable prices|4|We were stunned that an appetizer including four large scallop on a bed of lettuce was only $12 - and it was amazing! So was our entire meal. We would recommend this restaurant for excellent Italian food!
June 14, 2014|Decent menu - noisy atmosphere|3|The food at Siena was overall good, but not notable. The noise in the restaurant made it difficult to speak with my dinner companions in a normal conversational tone. Service was excellent.
June 14, 2014|As usual, consistently great food. Filet...|5|As usual, consistently great food. Filet special beats anything you can get at a high end steak house for less money. Sea bass is always fantastic.
June 14, 2014|Quaint and great food|4|Great food and nice menu. Excellent atmosphere with lots of choices. Elegant, and in the heart of town. A very nice place to walk around the town and the desserts were to die for. We went with friends and had a nice time. It was a good walk from fire water, but worth the walk.
June 13, 2014|overall good, but...|3|visited this place due to the good reviews - the caesar salad was fine (as expected) - the puglia salad was the best dish we had. extremely good and highly recommended - the vodka sauce was tasty, although disappointed that that penne was not homemade. it was reasonably priced, so i let that go. - the pan seared chilean sea bass was very well done, although smelled and tasted overly fishy. There were scallops in the dish, although it looked like they cut 2 scallops in half and made it into 4. Really? For a $26 entree (plus an additional $5 for asparagus because the server said we couldn't replace the side and my wife doesn't like green beans) i expected a bit more This was my first time at this restaurant - unsure if we'd go back
June 13, 2014|Outstanding meal!!!|5|We went with my 86 year old mom and 96 year old aunt. Expected a good meal but this was truly outstanding! The portions were very large, more than we could eat. The fig and prosciutto app was delicious, and the meatball was tasty and huge! Really a fantastic dinner!!!
June 13, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|Siena is a solid restaurant that is always consistent in great food and service. I had Pesce Spada alla Griglia - swordfish that was grilled fresh and flavorful. My friends had Aragosta Ciopino, which was loaded with shellfish and Penne alla Vodka. Everyone was very happy with our selection although we appreciated and a bit envious of the other choices at our table. The waitstaff kept our water glasses and bread basket full and were very attentive and accessible. We've been to Siena a few times and will return - so nice to know everything will always be perfect there.
June 12, 2014|A winner|4|Excellent place to dine. Very friendly staff. Delicious food
June 7, 2014|Excellent or Bland|4|"My wife got an excellent Rosemary spicy chicken dish that we asked to be made without butter as she is dieting. No problem they said and it was fabulous, as was the salad. I however got a pasta special that was disappointing and bland. When our waitress asked how was everything? I told her and she offered to get me something else. I ordered another pasta dish, one I had previously. It arrived ""quickly"" and my new Vodka sauce chicken pasta dish was excellent. This kind of customer service by waitstaff is outstanding. Ultimately the 2 dishes we had off of the standard menu (not a special) was great. The one thing I miss is that there is no chicken or veal Marsala dish at Siena.This is usually standard fare at most restaurants in Federal Hill."
May 31, 2014|great Italian|4|Exceptional Italian restaurant! The clams in garlic white sauce with a hefty crostini was ethereal. My wife's short rib was flavorful-Lord knows why they gave her a steak knife-a fork was all she needed. My veal saltimbocca was tender-two large medallions. Both dishes were served with a nice mashed and haricots vert. Desserts looked exceptional but we were too full. Only complaint was the dining area near the bar was VERY noisy-had to yell to converse with my wife. There are some back tables that I would recommend.
May 31, 2014|Fantastic!|5|Delicious food, attentive staff! Not to be missed!
May 30, 2014|Terrible experience|1|Appetizer was god awful-Calamari. Esp for being on Fed Hill. The entrees were very good. Noise level from bar permeates into main dining area an the waitress was rude to my wife thru the whole dinner. She couldnt recall any specials and refused to look at her notes. Snotty, rude, slow, incorrect on main entrees, and even refused to make change when i asked for the valet-a first for me at any restaurant. Not worth the hype. Stick with the keys Fed Hill joints who have great service and manage their restaurants well. Too bad since Ive taken a few clients for lunch and it was an ok experience. One poor server can ruin a nice night out with the wife sans kids. Oh well
May 29, 2014|It is a great restaurant. Food and servi...|5|It is a great restaurant. Food and service are both outstanding. Very friendly group of people. Will go back when ever I am in Providence.
May 24, 2014|Not as good as reviews|3|Picked the restaurant based on glowing reviews. Service excellent. Food did not really stand out. Chicken cutlet -- very ordinary. Artichoke appetizer unusual but small portion. Gnocci pasta drenched in cream sauce -- heavy, not light. Waiter was outstanding with wine selection and overall. No manager stopped by to say hello or see how things were going.
May 23, 2014|The worst service I've experienced|1|Full disclosure, I tried to make a reservation at Siena by phone two weeks. I left a detailed voice mail, and nobody returned my call. Two nights ago my wife and I had dinner there. We made an 8:30 reservation and arrive a few minutes early. We were not sat until 8:55. When we finally sat down, we ordered our drinks and appetizers right away because we were starving. The drinks came ten minutes later, but after a half hour we still didn't receive the appetizer. I asked the waitress what happened, and she said she forgot to put our order in. At that point I noticed Siena has a systemic failure in service, from the management down to the hosts. I will never go back to this mediocre restaurant again nor would I ever recommend it.
May 20, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|3|We were first time diners celebrating our 30th anniversary. We were seated early and in the bar dining area. Our server was attentive and we were served our drinks promptly. We shared the Arinicini appetizer which was a special that evening. It was heavy on the breading and lacked flavor in my opinion. We ordered Frutti di Marre and Brasato for our entrees. Both of these dishes were delicious. Cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. In hindsight we wish we were seated in the rear dining area as the bar crowd watching the MMA match didn't provide the ambience we were after, but we enjoyed the food and plan to return.
May 19, 2014|Fantastic Chicken Entree|1|We had Spanish-style Octopus for starters. This was a perfect start to our meal. Octopus was well prepared and the seasoning was excellent. My wife had the Scallops and they had great flavor and were perfectly cooked. At the suggestion of our waiter, I chose the Chicken Three Ways entree. I have had many chicken entrees in my life, but this is the absolute best. Fantastic meal!!
May 18, 2014|Food|5|Dinner is always fabulous ! I was only disappointed a bit in my short rib, the sauce was great, but it had a bit of a flavor in the meat of pot roast??? It was somewhat disappointing, all else was wonderful.
May 16, 2014|We celebrated our son's National Guard C...|2|We celebrated our son's National Guard Commissioning. The meal was excellent with just the right pacing between courses. The waitress was aware of us but not obtrusive so we could enjoy our meal without interruptions. Each entrée and the dessert was beautifully presented and delicious. The atmosphere made the evening special.
May 15, 2014|Always a great dining experience. Fantas...|5|Always a great dining experience. Fantastic food and staff. Would recommend Siena to anyone looking for a delicious meal.
May 15, 2014|Sienna remains a Tuscan Gem|4|"The menu at Sienna continues to provide wonderful Tuscan options with a wine list to match. I brought someone new to dine who had not been there before and it was great to see her joy in tasting the delicious pasta dishes, grilled vegetables, and drink superb Tuscan red blend. The variety on the menu as well as the evening specials left us both saying ""We cannot wait to come back""."
May 13, 2014|Excellent food!|4|"Anthony and Chris are still ""bringing it to the table""! It's been awhile since I've been back to Siena's---still the same concern for excellence! I knew that even though it was a Tuesday night--better make reservations!! Glad that we did---It still takes time for the food to be prepared so be prepared to wait -while enjoying a nice selection of wines and perhaps an app ( my favorite will always be the eggplant--prepared any way)! Our waitress--her first night on the floor--charming, knowledgable and if she thought she made the slightest mistake--all apologetic--wouldn't expect less. Will be back again when I return to the state!"
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day|5|We had dinner with the family for Mother's Day after seeing a play in Providence. Everyone was so nice, from the hostess, bartender and waitress. It was very relaxing and the food was excellent!
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day|2|I have been to Sienna's restaurant Providence and Smithfield a few times and always enjoyed it. I went last year to the Providence location for Mother's Day and loved it, I did not feel the same way this year and most likely will pick a different restaurant for next year. The food was not of the same quality as I have always known it to be, it actually was not that busy which surprised me and the waitress was not that friendly actually seem to have a little snip to her tone , the entire party I was with agreed never again, at least not at the Providence location I might give Smithfiled one more try. Someone else told me they were not pleased with Sienna but I was a huge fan and highly disagreed I do not feel I can do that anymore.
May 11, 2014|Excellent dining experience|5|I visited Siena for my 2nd time on Mother's Day and we all enjoyed out meals very much. The atmosphere was also great! Our server was always right there whenever we needed anything. The food was brought out perfectly spaced out...app, meal, dessert. I have no complaints at all. Delicious!!!
May 10, 2014|Great food but|4|It was really loud in there. Great for groups but not for a romantic dinner with your sweetheart.
May 8, 2014|tasty and affordable|4|We were very impressed with the food quality but the service was so so. Gnocchi was delicious and meatballs were fantastic. It took 10 mins to get a drink or the check after asking.
May 7, 2014|BELLA SIENA!|5|Great dining experience. Our reserved table was offered in the front of the restaurant adjoining the bar area. The bar was very busy and very noisy. We requested a different table location which was gladly accommodated. In the dining-only portion of the restaurant the floors are carpeted and the noise level is no problem whatsoever. The restaurant was quite busy but the filled tables created no noisy condition. Food and service were EXCELLENT. This is a dining establishment we are anxious to patronize often in order to try more of the menu items that are so inviting. Great menus make for difficult decisions! Thanks, Siena.
May 6, 2014|Very Good went 2 nights in a row|4|Ate one night at the bar and took a co-worker back the next night. Had the Chicken Rosemario the first night it was very good cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious. House bread is also very good; they give each table a basket with 3 different types of bread. Second night had veil it was outstanding, tender, flavorful, with a marsala sauce. I would recommend reservations the place was packed but nights and it was a Monday and Tuesday night.
May 4, 2014|good food...unhurried pace|4|Had a table in the back corner where we could relax, enjoy our meal and converse without having to raise our voices. Service was great. We shared appetizers, calamari with hot peppers had a nice zing. Our caesar salad had a little bit to much dressing, but the entrees were perfect. All in all. a very enjoyable meal.
May 1, 2014|2 a tee|5|"The restaurant is a great place to go to eat. I travel a lot and find dinner when I am traveling to be ""part of the job"", not too exciting. But I have been to Siena a number of times and will go back when ever I am in RI because, the food the staff the ambiance is just great. Staff is knowledge about food and wine. The food is prepared, ""how you like it"" and has very good variety. I feel like I can relax, have a great meal and head back to my hotel for a good sleep. I look forward to my travels to Providence and make sure I use ""open table"" to reserve a table at Siena."
May 1, 2014|Beware of the Specials|3|dined before the theater and had no problem with our reservation. Wait staff was average and that was the rub. We had a difficult time getting our order in as our waiter was busy talking to other staff members. The specials were described and we ordered one from the seletion only to have something completely different than what was described delivered. Waitress comment was she forgot what was in it and was sorry. We had run out of time so we were stuck with the dish.
April 26, 2014|great food and service|5|My wife and I went for our anniversary. The food was excellent and the waitress was very attentive. It was on the louder side but not to the point where you couldn't talk... was definitely worth it had a great dinner and a good time
April 26, 2014|Anniversary dinner|4|My wife & I went to Siena for an anniversary dinner. When reservation was made, asked for a table that was in a quiet, romantic part of the restaurant. Our table was anything but quiet! We were seated in the front part of the restaurant, near the partition next to the bar area. Food was excellent! Service somewhat slow (good 20 minutes from sitting to order taken). After making server aware of time constraints, things moved quicker. Food was excellent. Presentation & temperature good. Portion size adequate. Server returned to check on how meal was while we were 1/2-3/4 through meal.
April 26, 2014|Sienna Gem|5|We found Sienna to be outstanding. The food was awesome and Nicole our waitress was wonderful. Thank you.
April 22, 2014|This was our second visit. Food was just...|5|This was our second visit. Food was just as good, I had chilean sea bass (outstanding), my wife had swordfish (she said it was good but not as good as my dish) We had a scallop appetizer, also good. Service was excellent. After dinner, we asked for a little time to finish our wine before we had dessert, and got it despite it being busy. The only downside is the acoustics. When it is busy there, it is a very noisy restaurant.
April 21, 2014|Siena was very accomadating as I needed ...|4|Siena was very accomadating as I needed to change the time of our reservation at the last minute. Our's was a business dinner only drawback is the level of noise was such that it was difficult to discuss anything in detail. Food and service were outstanding.
Dined on April 21, 2014|Good food but bad service|3|Siena is a restaurant located on famous Federal Hill. I love the food here but the service is awful. The waiting staff are friendly but doesn't appear to be well trained to provide top-notch service. The wait time to order and be served is too long (average 30 mins.) I brought my family here for dinner and we didn't have our meal until 45 mins later. We were starved! Again, the food is very good but I hope that the manager seriously gets feedback from customers. I have recently dined at the East Greenwich branch and it is so much better that the one in Providence in all aspects. We are definitely not thinking of eating here anytime soon.
April 20, 2014|Great Eastet meal! |5|The staff made is feel very comfortable and attended to. The Chilean Sea Bass was incredible! Looking forward to our next visit.
April 20, 2014|Very Pleased|4|Considering we dined on a Holiday we were very pleased with this restaurant. Open menu, prompt, great food, good service. What more can one ask for. There were no mistakes, very unusual for a Holiday dinner in a restaurant.
April 19, 2014|Entrees were very good as they have been...|4|Entrees were very good as they have been in our past visits . Service started to run very slow towards the end.
April 19, 2014|delicious|5|Everything. Was delicious and our waitress was fantastic! Cant wait to go back
April 19, 2014|Impressed|5|Siena Providence is by far this restaurant's best location for food. The quality and taste outshine their other two locations. The braised short rib was fork tender and delightfully tasteful with just the right amount of risotto. The veal limone was done good, but not exceptional. The breading was slightly in the soggy side on this occasion. Otherwise, a nice table with a bottle of wine and good food...couldn't ask for much more!
April 19, 2014|Excellent Food|5|We selected Siena Restaurant in Providence for our Anniversary and were very pleased that we did. The stuffed artichoke appetizer was amazing. There were two small size artichokes - very tender and the sauce was delicious - a perfect start to the meal. We also ordered the shrimp and risotto. Their risotto is so creamy, it's the best I have tasted anywhere, including Italy. The restaurant is very popular because of the quality of the food so it is a bit noisy inside, but that just adds to the lively and vibrant scene. We enjoyed our evening and will definitely return.
April 19, 2014|"In one word. The ""best"" consistently. Al..."|5|"In one word. The ""best"" consistently. Always the best meal and dining experience."
April 19, 2014|Great|5|My partner and I really enjoyed having our Anniversary dinner at this restaurant. They even gave us Anniversary plates on the dessert we ordered with candles. It was so nice to be treated like any other couple! Really made us feel special on our special day and the food was extraordinary! Short rib with the risotto was out of this world! Thank you guys!
April 18, 2014|Dined prior to show at PPAC. Food is con...|4|Dined prior to show at PPAC. Food is consistently good. Sea Bass was great.
April 18, 2014|Delish|5|Just went to Siena for first time Friday night. Got there at opening and within 30 minutes it was packed. Food and service from Felicia was outstanding. Can't wait to return!!
April 16, 2014|Third time at Siena...|4|"though first time in a while. Every time food has been terrific. Wed night. Very busy. Pretty loud in the front (result of bar crowd). Made for energetic atmosphere, but not ideal for conversation. Service very good; waitress very knowledgable & patient. Would certainly recommend & go back. Made rez via OpenTable. Received message asking I call back to confirm. Found that somewhat annoying. I've had restaurants call to confirm, but never had them ask me to call back. Called back, got prompts, selected 'reservations', got v/mail. Left message confirming ""yes, I am coming'. Still nervous, because wanted to be sure they didn't misunderstand and think I was calling to cancel. Bottom line, feel I shouldn't have to make reservations twice."
April 15, 2014|always fabulous|5|The best risotto in all of providence. Certainly looking forward to going back again for more delicious dinner options
April 12, 2014|went with my family;, my husband|5|went with my family;, my husband and two daughters, the food and service was excellent, one of the best restaurants we have dined at
April 12, 2014|Wonderful...|5|...simply wonderful! In the Heart of Providences Federal Hill, competition is tough and Siena is right at the top. You won't be disappointed!
April 12, 2014|hair|3|after finding a hair in my drink the food was just ok i was turned off
April 11, 2014|Great food, not for easy conversing|4|We didn't realize that there is a back dining room, which was much quieter. Apparently, you have to ask for that. Sitting in the front of the restaurant, near the small bar, it was quite noisy and close-quarters. The food was very good though.
April 10, 2014|Dinner on April 10th|4|Excellent food and service. Too noisy - especially near the front door..
April 9, 2014|Poor acoustics|5|Excellent food and superlative service that is very reasonably priced. However, the noise level was comparable to a construction site! Our party of three had to scream at each other to hear each other's conversation. This is truly unfortunate since I really like this establishment but until the acoustics are addressed, I will not return. Incidentally, we all have perfect hearing.
April 9, 2014|GREAT FOOD!|5|A customer of mine actually works in the kitchen. He had recommended it. It was a special occassion and a great experience. It was my daughter's birthday. We all had a very good time and the food and service was very good.
April 7, 2014|I love this place!|3|I have been to Sienna many times but this time just wasn't as good as all the others. Our waitress seemed in a bad mood and our drinks took very long (if we were asked if we wanted another at all). Also she kept trying to wrap my food even though I said I would finish it. I felt very rushed which definitely isn't normal for this type of restuarant. Also my food was a little greasy but maybe it was just the way the sauce was. I will definitely go back hopefully it was just a bad day.
April 6, 2014|Siena Providence|4|Great place - had an excellent meal with out of town friends . . .
April 5, 2014|Never a disappointment|5|Siena is our go to restaurant when visiting Providence and we always have an excellent food experience.
April 5, 2014|Several rooms|5|We arrived and were seated by door in front bar! There for a birthday dinner with my brother from Philly and the bar was hopping with much younger crowd. We immediately asked if they possibly had something quieter and they moved us to another spot in a back room. Very nice we were able to talk and visit. Food was wonderful, service perfect. It is pricy but worth every penny. Enjoy
April 3, 2014|Always great|5|From the giant meatball and eggplant involtini to the veal scalopini with pocini the food was excellent.
April 2, 2014|Great food in Federal Hill|5|You cannot go wrong with having dinner at sienna service is fantastic food is awesome prices very acceptable
April 2, 2014|Wow!!|5|Absolutely fantastic food. I try Veal Saltimbocca at every Italian restaurant that has it on the menu. This was the best I have had. In addition the bolognese sauce was truly remarkable. Owner was great and truly appreciated our compliments. This is a must in Providence.
March 31, 2014|Tops on The Hill|5|"This is our favorite restaurant on Federal Hill. We always leave wishing we lived closer to RI, so we could dine at Siena more often. From appetizers to entrees to desserts we have never been disappointed. Siena is always on our ""must do"" list when we visit RI."
March 28, 2014|Good menu; could be healthier|4|This was a pleasant experience. There are so many interesting dishes on the menu that it was hard to choose. We enjoyed our food. The server was attentive and friendly at all times. The restaurant understood that we had limited time, and worked with us. As often happens with Italian restaurants, there was generally too much oil and/or butter on everything. The spicing was a bit heavy-handed as well. Because the tables are so close together, we got a nearby diner's obnoxious political opinions loud & clear through the entire meal. Not sure we'd have enjoyed that any better if we'd agreed with his views.
March 28, 2014|Content at Siena|5|Three of us had wonderful meals. We started off with calamari fritti. Not over fried. Just right! I had the Caprese Salad which was excellent. My companions has the baby spinach salad which they raved about. For the main course, I had the Bolognese, which was easily the best I have ever had. My companions had the Chilean sea bass and the swordfish, which they talked about all the way home. We didn't have much room for dessert but we did share the chocolate torta, which was delicious. We will definitely be coming back to Siena soon.
March 24, 2014|Good Food, Good Service. A Repreat,|4|The menu made it tough to decide and no one was disappointed with their choices! The service was really good with the full team attentive to our table. Worth a repeat when back in Providence.
March 23, 2014|Excellent in every way.|5|Special occasion - a small family get together. Siena was fabulous! Every course was delicious, the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. The terrific food and perfectly paced and friendly service made for a beautiful evening. A great value for fine dining. Highly recommend!!
March 21, 2014|I love sienna ..however this|2|I love sienna ..however this visit was not great. Our waitress lacked personality and was one of the worse we have ever had. Service was extremely slow also. We sat at 730 and we're not served our dinner until 9:30 .. All the while watching another full table seated after us being served before us.. Food very good but disappointed
March 20, 2014|Would have been perfect but..|4|Requested the back and best server. Got. Made us wait n wait for front table. Finally put Us in back Got. Maybe she was a good server but she had This condescending attitude which was very obvious
March 15, 2014|Sienna|5|We went there on a Saturday night, it was crowded but you didnt feel camped. We had a very nice table for two, the waitress was knowledgable of the menu and made fantastic recommendations. The proscotio and fig pizza was amazing..
March 15, 2014|Fun Foxy and 50|5|Had a great dinner with friends to celebrate a friend's 50th bday. Staff, food, wine and atmosphere were fabulous.From apps to desserts, everything was right on! Mangia!
March 14, 2014|Seeing the night at Siena's|5|We are big fans of Siena! Tonight, we didn't rave over the bolognese and pasta, but my Sea Bass was delicious, as was our outrageous Caprese salad and fried calamari to kick off the night. The restaurant is cozy, romantic, crowded and an overall great place to eat!
March 8, 2014|The dinner was wonderful.|5|The dinner was wonderful. the food was delicious and the service was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant.
March 6, 2014|Girls Night Out|5|We loved Siena! Our first time there. Giant meatball fabulous! Made last minute reservations and they were very willing to fit us in. Called cab and even gave us a wait time which was spot on. Can't wait to go back with our husbands.
March 5, 2014|This was our first time and|4|This was our first time and I must say not the last. The food and the service was outstanding.
Dined on March 2, 2014|My new favorite restaurant!|5|We were given a gift card for this restaurant and had never been here. It's a ride for us (50 minutes) but worth every minute of the drive! The whole dining experience was wonderful. The food was excellent and we had the lightest, most tender calamari we have ever had. The only downside to the visit was a very large group came in and was seated close to us and the room being very small became quiet noisy. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special place to dine.
March 1, 2014|Disappointing|3|Not as good as promised. Very crowded, very noisy, and the food was only fair. When you factor in inattentive service and miniscule portions, it is hard to recommend this restaurant when there are so many better ones in the Providence area
March 1, 2014|Italian|5|The food and service were outstanding. Our server was terrific as was the hostess. We will definitely be going back here again.
February 27, 2014|Great food!|5|Food, service and atmosphere was perfect for our night out to dinner.
February 24, 2014|Just a great place to relax|4|Just a great place to relax and have a good meal. Very friendly staff, nice place inside and good food
February 23, 2014|A definite new favorite!|4|We tried Sienna while visiting our son in RI. It was a good thing we made a reservation because it was quite full. They were one of few restaurants open on Sunday. We enjoyed an excellent bottle of wine and the short ribs were excellent over risotto which was perfectly prepared. Definitely a new favorite on Federal Hill! Valet parking if you like that, too!
February 22, 2014|Just superb food|5|Our first time at Siena, and absolutely not disappointed. The ambiance is casual fine dining done with warmth. There is complimentary valet parking which is a must on Atwells Ave. Our server, Nick, was great and the food was superb! We started with the calamari and the grilled stuffed Portobello mushroom, both were just great. For dinner: we had the Chicken Milanese, the Braised Short Ribs, and two orders of Veal Milanese. The Milanese wasn't on the menu but they were happy to make it. Delicious! The side of risotto was perfection. I have to mention the reasonable prices! The wine list was excellent. The desserts deserve a special mention: the fried doughboys were so good we fought over them. A brilliant evening all around.
February 22, 2014|Sienna is tops|5|Great food, good service, lively ambience, and valet parking. A great way to spend a Saturday night.
February 21, 2014|Our food was mixed ....two|4|Our food was mixed ....two of the four enjoyed their selection and two did not. Our server was acceptable but very robotic and not overly friendly. We always enjoy Siena....may be just an off night
February 20, 2014|An excellent food experience...|4|My wife and I started with their clams and sausage appetizer special, and she ordered the Rigatoni alla Norcina, a wonderful rigatoni pasta dish with sausage, porcini mushroom saute, and white truffle oil while I had the Brazino, a Chilean sea bass with ocean sea scollops in a white creamy scallion sause that was perfectly prepared and remarkably tasty. The wine selections were good and we enjoyed the fact we could cork the bottle to take home with us.
February 19, 2014|great service|4|We were sat almost immediately.The service was fantastic, Kelly did an excellent job taking care of us. The food was good but the service stood out more so.
February 19, 2014|Always a good meal!|4|Had a great time - good food, great service, and a fun atmosphere to meet with friends. Will definitely be back!
February 17, 2014|Good food...Terrible seat!|2|We sat in the hallway seat and the traffic was nonstop . People walking by going to seats, kitchen staff coming in and out of swinging doors, and every time the door opened we felt the draft. It was our anniversary and we were looking forward to a quiet romantic setting. I would not go back for a special occasion again.
February 17, 2014|Have been dining at Fedral|4|Have been dining at Fedral Hill on and off for the past 30 years.Do not know why we haven't experienced Sienna but would rate it as best on Hill. The Chilean sea bass was the best we ever had.
February 16, 2014|Delicious|4|Everything was delicious, and the portions were large, if you're into that. (We took some things home.) My one complaint is that the tables are very close together. The couple next to us kept commenting on our food, which wasn't the worst thing that could happen, but it cut down on the privacy factor.
February 16, 2014|Inconsistency.|4|Perhaps I don't look like the average Siena regular, because when we arrived we were never informed of any dinner specials (which I typically order!!) nor did we receive a wine list. However, the couple that sat next to us 20 minutes through our meal was given the whole kit and kaboodle. Not sure if I could describe it as discrimination, but we clearly got a lower level of service from the same waiter than the people next to us, who were apparently regulars. As an Executive Chef and a 15yr industry veteran, I must suggest that they lose the pompous, discriminatory service practices. Not a good look, Siena.
February 16, 2014|Great Experience|5|I don't know what was better...the food or the service!
February 16, 2014|Great food|4|We dined on a Sunday night during a holiday weekend. The restaurant was busy, and unfortunately, the only table available was next to the kitchen. A little noisier than we would have liked. However, the remainder of the experience was superb. The staff was attentive, and our bass and swordfish entrees were prepared perfectly. We shared pizza and salad appetizers amongst four of us -- more than enough for a small appetite. The chocolate bread pudding topped off a wonderful dinner.
February 14, 2014|Great all around|5|Valentine's day dinner was a smash. Arrived a little early for our reservation and sat at the bar for a drink. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. Very busy because of the date but still was nice. Sat before our time which was great. Got a quiet table in a small back room which was lovely. Greeted right away and a drink and app order taken. Calamari came out in minutes. Bread was great. Server was way above par. Food came, although took some time, understandably busy night, it was as ordered and delicious to the last drop. Had a pleasant time all around. Would definitely return and recommend.
February 14, 2014|Excellent food and ambiance!|5|This is the first time that my wife and I have dined here. We have been wanting to go for a while but having a 4 year old doesn't usually allow for fine dining. Anyway, this will be a once a month destination for us now. The service was excellent! I'll say it again, the service was excellent! Nick is an outstanding waiter, thank you for your professionalism. We didn't feel rushed at all, that is very important to me. I like to enjoy every course, and for me, that means savoring every bite. The food aside, I'm also there to enjoy the company of my wonderful wife. The less rushed we feel, the better the experience.
February 9, 2014|Very expensive- portions are|3|Very expensive- portions are good- seafood was not good- lobster was very rubbery and fishy. Was like it had been cooked earlier in the day and then reheated. Bread was hard as a rock and cold.
February 9, 2014|Food was fantastic. Chef went|5|Food was fantastic. Chef went off the menu to accommodate my children. Karen, our server, was great and very friendly with my kids.
February 8, 2014|Hot spot|2|Very crowded, noisy, long wait for a table in spite of reservation, parking by valet only Probably better choices in that popular area
February 8, 2014|Exceptional Server, Good Food|3|"Drinks were generous, ""special"" salad was outstanding and large enough to split, entrees were good.....not spectacular. EXTREMELY noisy and difficult to converse with dining partners."
February 8, 2014|A dinner to remember!|5|Everything about this restaurant is wonderful! The ambience, the drinks, the bread and olives...and the food was fabulous and very generously portioned. I highly recommend it! I noticed also that the restaurant can accommodate larger groups - ours was 5 people and we had a round table which makes it so nice for conversation but there were many larger groups! I have to say that I am Italian and grew up eating great Italian food. I rarely order Italian food when I go out because I am usually disappointed...not the case here! I was thrilled to have leftovers to bring home. It can be difficult to get a reservation but it's worth trying!!!
February 1, 2014|Our favorite|5|Siena is consistently excellent. We always leave raving how good that meal was. The best!!
February 1, 2014|Great food, good service, bad seat|4|DEFINATELY try it! You won't be disappointed but DO NOT sit at the awful booth that is right outside The kitchen door and gives a full view into the men's room! The restaurant should consider making that a waiting room Area. Don't make your guest sit in that awful spot.
February 1, 2014|Great Find|5|Read up on the reviews and was excited to make a reservation. The food was fabulous and the wait staff so attentive and knowledgeable. Fantastic wine list.
February 1, 2014|First time|5|My wife and I have been wanting to try the restaurant scene in Providence for a while now. We live close to Boston and eat in the North End a couple of times per year. We heard the Federal Hill area offered some great choices and we finally made it there Saturday night. The ride to Providence was easy and the valet parking was nice and convenient. Our waitress Kelly was excellent giving us advice on wine and dinner choices. We started with an antipasto platter which was one of the better ones that I have had anywhere. I had the veal saltimboca and my wife had the 16oz veal chop which looked awesome when they served it. Both dishes were delicious. We very much enjoyed our dinner and will likely be back soon.
January 31, 2014|Great food - Loud atmosphere|3|Great valet, small entry, small bar, service was average, loud atmosphere BUT Great food! My compliments to the chefs! I'm particular when I choose to eat at a restaurant claiming to delight all your senses and am very disappointed when the experience doesn't prove out. Thank IOU for the great Chilean Sea Bass and Swordfish but We won't be back.
January 30, 2014|Great food...murder on conversation|3|We were seated at a table for 2 with neighbors less than 2 feet away on both sides. One side was a quiet couple while the other side was loud and never stopped telling her life story and daily activities. The background noise level was so high we had to repeat everything. After a while it was easier to just shut up and eat. Fortunately the food was great. Your better off driving to East Greenwich or Smithfield locations to get the same great food but much easier on your ears.
January 29, 2014|Looking for Italian?|4|I had a classic bolognese sauce with homemade pasta. It was excellent. My friend had a chicken dish with butternut squash risotto. It was also excellent and the presentation was magazine worthy. Overall very nice experience.
January 27, 2014|We went on a Monday night|3|"We went on a Monday night so maybe we got the ""B"" team. Food was very bland and not that good. We don't get what all of the hype is about. We have been to many restaurants in Providence and Cafe Nuovo is our favorite."
January 26, 2014|Delicious trendy Italian food!|4|Not sure why all the mediocre reviews for this place. I have now been to 5 different places on Federal Hill and all were pretty good. For a Sunday night this place was jam packed with crowds so reservations are recommended any night. The menu is loaded with Italian concoctions, from appetizers, like the Polpette Grande which was the largest meatball I have ever seen or the Involtini - eggplant rolled with Prosciutto and filled with Ricotta and how about the delicious truffle fries. Entrees range from traditional homemade pasta like Rigatonni with homemade sauce with sausage and Veal dishes like the Saltimbocca or Scallopine. Each dish was absolutely done just right and again, delicious. Highly recommend this place!
January 25, 2014|Whoa!|5|Had dinner with one other couple - totally a fantastic dinner! I cannot say it enough - get the meatball for a starter - ground sirloin, veal, and topped with ricotta cheese! One can be shared - but good luck sharing it! The special that night was an 8oz filet butterfly cut stuffed with eggplant, cheese, and bacon - every single bite was awesome. We had a 7pm reservation and had to wait about 10 minutes - tight space so really no where to stand but the dinner was well worth it. Service was very good as well - Drink menu was different but good! This is a MUST go!
January 25, 2014|Bad, then Better|3|Have eaten here many times before. We were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time at a table that was 10 feet from the men's bathroom. As we sit down, we're greeted to a terrible someone-just-took-a-dump smell. It didn't go away. As we were waiting for the server in order to be moved, they sat another group at the other table right next to the men's bathroom. Within 10 seconds they asked to move. Why would a restaurant put a table, let alone two, anywhere near the bathroom (which is also next to the kitchen door and thus has constant traffic)? So we had to wait 15 minutes for a table in the much more desirable back room to open. Once we were seated, service was very good, the food was good, and everything went well.
January 24, 2014|Always Great!|5|We discovered Siena a couple of years ago. It is now our favorite. Fantastic Italian Food tweaked regularly for seasonal choices. Service is always perfect. Great food that is more expensive everywhere else. For a dinner for 2, including drinks and apps, we usually run about $100 total. Get's very busy, so get a reservation.
January 18, 2014|Great experience|4|Good meal, terrific service. We didn't feel rushed - just relaxed and taken care of. The food was great. I had the salmon and my husband had penne with shrimp in vodka sauce. The shrimp were good quality - better than many other restaurants, especially for a pasta dish. We came for restaurant week, but have been several other times. We also had the meatball and calimari appetizers (both good). The desserts were pretty good too. They have gelato.
January 18, 2014|Dinner at Sienna|4|We knew it had to be good when we walked in 5:30pm, we expected it to be empty, but the bar was full, the tables were almost full. The service was very good, we hit on Restaurant week, and the menu for that was very generous. We were a party of 4 and we all had a very good experience, very good food for a very reasonable price. The gelato was amazing
January 16, 2014|Simply great|5|Wonderful place- great food and a nice range choices on the menu. You have to try the Meatball app!
Dined on January 16, 2014|Successful and tasty work dinner|5|Group of 7 for a business meeting. Server Nick was awesome, very attentive, helpful, and responsive. Food was great. Good wine selection also. And they have the best fried dough dessert and cappucinos too!
January 15, 2014|Girl's night out|4|Completely enjoyed our girl's night out. We were seated promptly with our reservation. Delicious bread and olives to snack on. We had a delicious appetizer followed by a delicious entree. Salmon over lobster risotto had chunks of lobster in it! My pork chop was moist and flavorful. Mom's chicken saltimbocca was excellent. Excellent all the way around. The only thing that kept me from awarding five stars was the side dish. It was polenta which I didn't care for nor did my Mom or sister. Other than that, cannot wait to dine here again.
January 14, 2014|Siena during Restaurant Week|3|The meatball with marinara sauce had a lovely melt in your mouth texture and a good but not great sauce, it needed more spiciness, or something. The pork chop was mostly well cooked if slightly dry and the balsamic glaze was not abundant enough to make a big difference in the dish. The polenta cake was was fantastic and the green beans plain but tasty. A lobster risotto was extremely rich and had big chunks of lobster. Mixed salad with nuts and gorgonzola was overdressed and plate was ice cold, greens were a little soggy and the dressing was unremarkable. The pasta and pizza may be where they really shine, why else would it have received so many accolades? Atmosphere was so loud as to make conversation difficult. Service was great.
January 14, 2014|Too noisy|3|I was at a table for two and I could barely hear my guest. Even the waitress complained about the noise - she was completely frustrated trying to tell us the specials because she couldn't talk over the noise. Something has to be done about the acoustics. The food was excellent, but the noise would prevent me (51) and my guest (22) from returning.
January 12, 2014|Rhode Island Number 1 Restaurant|5|The best restaurant in Rhode Island although it is a little expensive I can guarantee you you'll get your money worth. They have great food & great service. Its a perfect place to celebrate an anniversary, Mother's Day,or even to take some one on a first date.
January 11, 2014|Should have informed us about|4|Should have informed us about restaurant week before ordering and beginning to eat our appetizer. We would have done the restaurant week deal!!!!
January 11, 2014|Outstanding meal and service|5|Just happened that it was Food Week and what a deal! Three delicious courses and great menu choices! Wishing my commute wasn't an hour or I'd be a frequent customer! I will be back!
January 4, 2014|Excellent!|5|Food and service were outstanding as we enjoyed at birthday dinner for my wife. The food is always impressive and prices are more than reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food you receive. The buffalo mozzarella appetizer with proscuitto that melted in your mouth was the highlight of the evening.
January 4, 2014|Wonderful Girls Night out Diner|5|We started our girls weekend out at Siena's and it was a great choice. The atmosphere was very pleasant and relaxed but not super casual so it made the night feel special. The Menu had something for everyone ....each meal was delicious and the presentation was first rate. Our server was very pleasant and got our hugs at the end of the evening. WE would all highly recommend! this dining experience!
December 31, 2013|Siena never disappoints|5|Had a wonderful dinner New Year's eve. Food was great.....as usual.
December 30, 2013|Delicious!|5|Great food, great service and fun on Federal Hill! I would recommend this restaurant!
December 28, 2013|Excellent date night|5|Siena is my husband and I's fave restaurant! Amazing food and atmosphere!
December 28, 2013|Perfect night out|5|Great restaurant in federal hill. Very close to the downtown area and accessible by cab in less than 5 minutes. Can't go wrong!
December 27, 2013|Siena is a great place.|4|We had 830 reservations and were seated by 845. The owner Chris was very apologetic and once seated, we had a great waiter who catered to our every need. The food is great, the wine is great and what a well run establishment overall.
