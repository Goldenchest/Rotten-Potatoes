February 20, 2016|Great restaurant|4|Great place to have different drinks and eat dinner. We went to eat on a Saturday night. We ordered appetizers and entrees, chicken pate , along with fritters for apps. The entrees we ordered were cod and short ribs, both meals and entrees were delish. For dessert we had the rice pudding , it was fantastic. We also sampled multiple bourbon while there. The staff are hospitable and it was a pleasure to go there. I'm sorry we waited so long to try it...we will definitely return and bring friends.
February 20, 2016|Love this place|5|Excellent for brunch and dinner! The menu is small, but everything on it is amazing.

February 14, 2016|They more than accommodated four adults ...|4|They more than accommodated four adults and four kids (ages 8months to 13yrs) for a late Sunday brunch. Super nice. Excellent tasting food with perfectly poaches eggs.
February 13, 2016|Cork dorks look no further!|4|Came in from out of town for the weekend... and because the reservation had made online, we were unaware that there would be a fixe menu. However, it was to be expected as it was Valentines Day weekend after all); and that's pretty much my only complaint. The food was outstanding and the wine list was clearly well thought out and very fit for those looking for quality, and deliciousness.
February 13, 2016|Pre-Fix Valentines menu-bummer- but good|5|I wish we knew it was a pre-fix menu as the prices were double for everything. That is something that Open Table should either make note of or put a notification when booking restaurants during holiday's to confirm with the restaurant that there may be a pre-fix menu.
January 16, 2016|Have had better meals elsewhere|2|We went for dinner tonight and were pretty disappointed. The chicken liver pate probably the highlight. I had a beet salad - overwhelmed with beets - and I love them! My husband had the squash soup which was just okay and there was alot of it. There was a crunchy brittle on top that was very sweet. He had the gnocchi for his entree which was good but needed seasoning. I had the chicken which was fine; rice side was just awful. No flavor, no seasoning and an odd combination of rice, grapefruit, herbs and cauliflower. Will not be back.
January 9, 2016|Disappointment|4|I was very disappointed that we were served on very chipped plates. We had invited friends who had never been to Cook and Brown. It was embarrassing to me that the food arrived on plates that clearly should have been thrown out !! Food and wait staff were excellent.
January 2, 2016|ounce of polite goes long way|3|staff needs to just be more warm and inviting. dont talk back to the customer when he asks for something. when you unlock door open it for the women patrons and smile. its a table of 7 you are getting a locked in tip. go above and beyond. didn't this time. food was good but staff needs to be more gracious, maybe female touch would help!
December 31, 2015|Great charcuterie|4|The charcuterie board was fantastic and full of items I would not normally have. Overall great meal and great mixed drinks.
December 4, 2015|The soup was exquisite, steak perfectly ...|5|The soup was exquisite, steak perfectly seasoned, service impeccable... bravo, boys!!
November 13, 2015|Wonderful and friendly service. The staf...|5|Wonderful and friendly service. The staff are professional and very knowledgeable about their current menu, as well as past menus. Food was excellent as well. We will absolutely be returning.
November 7, 2015|Trust the Chef!|5|Went out on a date with my wife. We both ordered the steak and it was cooked perfectly and the meat was great quality. Small menu but trust the chef to put the right ingredients together. Always well designed meals.
October 21, 2015|Delightful|5|I came here for a going away dinner with my boyfriend. The food was amazing. I had gnocchi with apples and squash, and he had the beer/bourbon/burger special. I had a cocktail made with Rye and proseco that both looked and tastes amazing. The highlight for both of us was the charcuterie board which was a mix of pickled vegetables and pates. Our server was also lovely and managed to sell us on a delicious chocolate brownie for desert All in all a wonderful dining experience
October 17, 2015|The service was spectacular. Wish I coul...|4|The service was spectacular. Wish I could remember the server/seeming manager's name because he deserves a raise. He accommodated our change of reservation time, could not have been friendlier, more sincere or more informed and helpful. The food was absolutely excellent despite the limited menu but it was due to the farm to table concept that I truly appreciate. A bit pricy for an out of the way place outside of Providence, but it was a treat!
August 19, 2015|Wednesday BBB|4|"Went there for Wednesday's ""Burger, Beer and Bourbon"". My wife and I tried the two burgers of the night - ""standard"" C&B Burger and an All-American burger. Both were great with the C&B possibly getting a slight edge. We also tried two sides, fried pickles and house fries. It is not needed in terms of amount of food but we wanted to sample the menu; both were nice with the fried pickles being the clear favorite for both of us. The whole package with beer and bourbon made for a great evening in a relaxed setting, Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu; absolutely recommend a visit."
August 12, 2015|inventive menu, attentive service|5|inventive menu, attentive service. Neat cocktail list
July 23, 2015|Restaurant week - Very Good Food|4|I went to Cook & Brown for dinner during restaurant week. They had really good food. It was a little bit pricey but also solid and I would recommend going there to anyone.
July 22, 2015|We expected a more of a tavern ambience-...|2|We expected a more of a tavern ambience-not as upscale. Just not what we expected.
July 14, 2015|Great food!|5|We had not been to Cook & Brown for a while, in spite of living in the neighborhood, and we were entirely delighted with our experience. One of us took the restaurant week selection, and the other ordered off the menu. The salad and blue fish cakes were inventive and subtle, while the lobster roll my wife ordered zoomed to the top of her very long and exacting list of lobster rolls. The semifreddo berry desert was similarly transcendent. The room was quiet because we are early, but I have gone by many times when it has been jammed. Wonderful place, and cheaper than the other real fine dining possibilities.
July 12, 2015|Sunday Supper is a fun adventure|5|This place has a great ambiance and an amazing bartender. The servers are friendly and acommodating. We happened to go in on a Sunday and ended up sampling their Sunday supper option, which is a family style surprise based on the diner's preferences and restrictions. Though the final product wasn't entirely consistent with the requests we made, it was a fun experiment and everything turned out delicious. We look forward to going back here and trying more of what they have to offer!
July 10, 2015|Great as always|5|"Rarely are we disappointed by one of our main go-to date spots, Cook & Brown. Last night was as satisfying as ever. As a reasonably accomplished home cook myself, my standard for a good restaurant is pretty low - could I make it better? Sadly, many times at other joints the answer is ""yes,"" but this has *never* been true at C&B, and it's difficult to imagine it being true at all. This is gastro-pub raised to the next level. The mixed drinks we got were multi-layered and nuanced and intensely alcoholic - all to the good. The bluefish fritters (don't even think of skipping these) were as light, hot, and perfect as they've ever been. The sea bass entree (which will probably not be there when you go, as they change the main courses very frequently) was a solid piece of well-cooked, almost meaty fish in a buttery broth filled with scrumptious fresh green veggies. The quinoa tabouleh was similarly stuffed with summer greens that made it a great companion for the fish. Portions are not big, but not small either. Service was attentive without being intrusive or solicitous, and for a Friday night it wasn't too noisy at all. I hope C&B never goes away - it's too refreshing."
May 1, 2015|1st and possibly last|2|Overpriced dinner for the portions - $12 for 2 lamb ribs. Baked Orrechiette was edible but nothing special. Grilled Boyden Farms Sirloin Tip Steak was tasty and cooked perfectly but the swiss chard, romesco, and giardiniera was bland. Would not recommend this place for dinner but more like share appetizer and beer/wine.
April 19, 2015|Good for a Sunday night|3|The restaurant that we would have gone to was not open on Sunday night so we decided to try the Public House. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and immediately brought us water which had a chlorine taste so we asked for bottled water. I only mention this because at one point while my wife and I were in deep conversation another server came over and filled our glasses with the chlorinated water even though we had a bottle of still water on our table. Now, this wasn't the end of the world and I am sure it was a fluke, but it was part of our experience.On the plus side , the bread was excellent, so was the beet salad and the cod entree was good although a little more spice would have made it that much better. Living on the coast of South Carolina, I am a fan of fried oysters. For my money, Franks of Pawleys Island is the best I've ever had. There was nothing wrong with the oysters at Public House but when one has experienced Paradise, everything else is jejune.Finally, the French Malbec we ordered was tasty but thin; I prefer the high mountain Argentinian malbecs. We would go back some future Sunday as there is always Hope in Providence.
March 18, 2015|Great food|5|I have visited this Restaraunt many times. Each time the food is great. It is worth the trip!
February 14, 2015|A Great Bistro that Can Be a Bit Stuffy|3|"I made reservations at Cook and Brown for Valentine's evening. We have been to Cook and Brown before and it seemed a perfect choice for a wonderful evening. Upon arriving, we were brought to our table on the other side of the restaurant facing the wall. Seeing that the restaurant was only-half full, I asked if we could be re-seated near the window. The hostess told me that I couldn't because I had an ""assigned"" seat. Two other couples asked if they could be re-seated from the same section I was in. The hostess told one couple no and the waitress sat the other couple where they wanted to sit. I was at Cook and Brown for 90 minutes and no one ever sat at the three tables I wanted to move to. It seems like such a small detail, but on this special evening I wanted everything to be right. I cannot think of a reason why Cook and Brown would employ a hostess that didn't understand dining and ambiance. Rhode Island and nearby Massachusetts have a plethora of great restaurants and bistros; many times the only discernible feature is the customer service. And on this night Cook and Brown failed."
January 23, 2015|Favorite in Providence so far|5|Moved to the Providence area recently and have been trying out a bunch of places. So far, this one is my favorite. We have been there twice and will be back. The food is very fresh and local. We tend to get 1 dinner and bunch of apps because you can share easily. Our friends love the cocktails menu, very creative. The inside appeal is pretty sharp. Try it and it'll become your go-to restaurant with guests. My only negative is that the service doesn't pester you, but almost to the point that you may feel ignored. So i gave 4/5 for that.
January 9, 2015|Not sure what changes about this place, ...|2|Not sure what changes about this place, but I've eaten here many times and this was my least enjoyable experience. Was cold, service was inattentive, food was duller than usual...hope it was just an off night for them!
January 1, 2015| Potential|4|I went with my Mother and boyfriend on New Years Day for brunch. We were seated immediately as we had a reservation, however, our table was near the door and up against the window so it was a bit drafty. We started with Bloody Mary's which were excellent and then proceeded to order various food items on the menu. They were tasty, but not served warm as they should have been. The food took about an hour to come out which seemed too long for brunch...I think between the holiday rush and hangovers the staff were nursing things didnt run as smoothly as they do on a normal brunch day. I will check it out again on a regular day and hope my experience is perfect!
November 30, 2014|very quiet but very good|4|We dined at C&B on Sunday evening...with the New England Patriots playing late Sunday at home, the restaurant was very quiet...we understand from the staff that this is generally the case when the Pats play in Foxboro since the restaurant (happily for many of us) doesn't have TV monitors! The food is consistently interesting and well prepared...a real asset to the Providence food scene!
November 23, 2014|The food is creative, perfectly cooked, delicious.|4|"Open Table needs to have space for a comment by the diner when making a reservation such as ""where do we want to sit?"" or dietary needs/allergies, comments I would make when phoning in a reservation. The internet reservation is convenient, but really lacking in serving customer preferences."
November 21, 2014|A surprise!|4|We went here early before a play so not too busy. Food and service excelent. Was getting busy as we were leaving. Will definitely try again.
November 15, 2014|The food at Cook and Brown is amazing- v...|3|The food at Cook and Brown is amazing- very hipster, very different for Providence. We have been here several times and always enjoy the changing menu. In the winter the restaurant is extremely cold. We were seated in the window which is a single pane and near the door which opens directly into the dining room. We were not the only patrons who kept our coats on for the meal. Request a table at the back or check out Cook and Brown on a warm night.
October 24, 2014|Food & Drinks Delicious As Always|4|The cocktails are fun--I always try something new--and the food is fresh, local, creative and delicious. I noticed this time how pricey the sides are. My friend ordered the cod with roasted potatoes as a side dish. He received a little crock with a handful of fingerling potatoes, very simple, and honestly, something that costs about a dollar to make even with potatoes from the farmers market. For this I think they charged $4.50. When you are getting $24 for a piece of fish, you could throw a few little potatoes in. My polenta app with soft-cooked egg was cold in the middle, I think because the plate it was served on was cold. A small detail but for an expensive place it matters.
October 5, 2014|so, ok, we know the owner Nemo, through ...|5|so, ok, we know the owner Nemo, through his Mom, Sharon, so we got some special treatment...but....the food is the food (even if we got some extra treats) and it is beyond delicious. we had sunday supper, which is the chef's choice, prepared for the table (if so chosen) and it was perfect from start to finish with interesting, but not pretentious, dishes. if we lived in providence we would be at Cook and Brown every week.
October 4, 2014|Food is way better than the service|3|We waited 14 min too long to be seated for a table in the middle of the room (with reservations) as well as getting our drinks. I & another at my table loved the Pan Roasted Cod. Hubby enjoyed fried chicken & son loved his Gnocchi dish as well. I have to say Roasted carrots is a better name for their roasted cauliflower & carrots dish since I barely found any of the white veggie as I searched through the trove of carrots filling my plate only to find tiny pieces of cauliflower - a bit of a disappointment considering the harvest of the white stuff I was looking forward too. My son loved his peach cake(?) ice cream dish while the 3 others at our table felt the creamy rice pudding was anything but creamy. Service should be as good as the food.
September 30, 2014|Disappointing|2|Unfortunately almost everything we tried was a disappointment. The fried oysters were heavily breaded and overcooked, the bluefish fritters were lighter but had little flavor of bluefish. Our salads were wonderful, but a tiny portion for the price. ($8.) We shared a pasta dish, which was very heavy and bitter. They were accommodating and let me order something else, so I chose the hand rolled cavatelli dish. Much better flavors, but the pasta was still leaden. I would have rather had store bought pasta! As a consolation, they brought out a scotch egg, gratis, which we appreciated, but were not in the mood for after the heavy pasta. Staff very nice, but will not return.
September 27, 2014|Below average|2|I saw a hig recommendation from food and wine magazine for this restaurant so decided to try it out. I was incredibly disappointed with the vast majority of the meal. The mussels didn't hvae much flavor and neither did the pate. I order the corn chower and what i received was vergetables with 3 mussels cooked in a broth. There was nothing chowder like about this dish. The only appetizer I did enjoy was the bluefish fritters. For the entrees my group order the pork dish with ricotta, the crab rissoto, and the fried chicken. The only notable dish was the chicken. We also order the gnocchi which ended up having a hair in it. Rather than take that dish off of our check, the server brought a drink. when the person already had one.
September 20, 2014|favorite|5|My favorite restaurant in Providence. Always changing and interesting food menu. Great cocktails.
Dined on September 20, 2014|Cozy, unpretentious, and delicious|5|The best part by far about Cook and Brown is the pairing of the atmosphere and the food. On one hand, the food sets a high standard for the dining experience here. With food this good, there are usually expectations of formality, however to my relief this is not the case with Cook and Brown. From the super personable wait staff to the creative but unassuming menu options, and the casual yet hip decoration Cook and Brown makes you really settle in and feel at home. Its this coziness that dominated the entire dining experience and will bring me back for more in the future.
September 20, 2014|food good, atmosphere not good|3|They have redone the interior of the restaurant. Previously it was pleasant with a feeling of quality, nice tables, 4 tops (square). they put in a bench along the wall and have two tops lined up against it. I assume it is to give them flexibility for parties. All the tables were two tops. The bench was uncomfortable and the wall art blah. Service was good. i ordered a Tanqueray 10 martini. Good. the bill came and it was broken out as $11 for Tanqueray, $2 for martini pour and $1 for ordering it dry!. I questioned the dry when i got the bill and they took off the $1. Why not just charge $13? Even that is a bit pricey for the size received. Food was good. Cod and Risotto. Nothing left to take home.
September 11, 2014|Always good|4|Small menu but always able to find something I like. Food combinations are unusual but again very pleasing. Very nice wine list. Service is extremely pleasant.
September 7, 2014|Great Sunday Night Supper|5|Cook and Brown has a special 3 course family-style supper on Sunday nights. We tried it this week and it was great. They are flexible about what they will serve, asking you if you have any allergies or foods that you don't want to eat. One of our party is a pescetarian so they served us a fried oyster appetizer and fish entree. I highly recommend going to Cook and Brown for Sunday night supper. They also have interesting wines and outstanding cocktails.
September 6, 2014|Good food hot environment|3|The food was delicious! My only thing I'd change is I'd have them buy fans. They said that the AC was fully cranked up, but both my date and I were sweating throughout the entire meal. I still like the food but we were definitely having to drink a ton of water and even put ice on our skin just to cool down.
September 6, 2014|Too Hot!|3|Without air conditioning, it was difficult to enjoy the meal. Menu selections were made with the oppressive heat in mind and that felt limiting. Food OK.
August 16, 2014|Aug 16|5|We had another wonderful meal here. Attentive service. Inventive craft cocktails .The bartender aims to please. Locally sourced food. The menu changes often. A real Plus.
August 16, 2014|Great cocktails|5|They always deliver a great, seasonal cocktail list. Love them.
August 8, 2014|Amazing!|5|Our dinner at Cook & Brown Public House was fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious and the ambiance was great.
August 2, 2014|Once is Not Enough!|5|We have had the pleasure of eating at Cook & Brown twice in two days! Different visiting friends wanted a special meal; C & B gave us exactly that! All eight meals were presented with a flourish by friendly waitstaff who were prompt and professional. I enjoyed two appetizers one night: smoked bluefish and potato fritters (crispy out, smoky/steamy in) and fried squid (fresh, perfectly cooked). Next night it was corn and smoked mussel soup (very fresh, popcorn and tomato garnish!) with a side of beets & horseradish (surprisingly yellow beets!). Others had steak tips, (which they would not share), steamed mussels with cider (not a scrap left) grilled corn on the cob (looked tasty). Drinks (creative and tasty), beers & wine, all excellent.
July 29, 2014|Meh|3|"Out of just a few menu options I chose the gnocchi with ""carrot top pesto"" but was served a very fennel-heavy dish (think licorice) with six or seven huge chunks of gnocchi the size of strawberries surrounded by pickled carrots and crushed almonds. On the whole very dry and there was no mention of fennel on the menu or I would've known to avoid it. Disappointing dish and everyone else at the table reported feeling pretty ""meh"" about theirs."
July 23, 2014|Good first time visit|4|I recently ate at C & B with a friend. The rotating menu had many items that all looked great. I had the pan seared cod, which was tasty. It was served in a light chowder-type broth with some small potatoes and a small dice of some other veg. My friend had the C & B burger, which was delicious. The fried squid appetizer was excellent. Friendly service and a cool, casual vibe made a nice outing.
July 17, 2014|Another great dinner|5|We hit C&B for Providence restaurant week, and once again we came away happy. Bit of a heavy menu for summer, but the lamb rillettes and pork bun appetizers were undeniably tasty, and the mussels & cod cake entrée seemed like light fare next to them but was equally good. (The bluefish fritter appetizer we always get was a knocked hit yet again). Good thing the portions weren't huge, because we tended to polish off what we were given. The confit chicken was the exception - it was so rich it was hard for our ladies to finish their plates, but every bite was bliss. I highly recommend having the bartender's choice for a drink, too - we did it again and were thoroughly pleased with our astringent, lime-cilantro, curaçao-infused concoction.
June 27, 2014|cook and brown|5|i love this restaurant and was so glad to discover it the first week i moved to providence several years ago. they have excellent cocktails and a delicious brunch--perfect for anyone looking for a sit down after the summer farmer's market in lippitt park. dinner is also very good, with a frequently changing menu according to the season.
June 8, 2014|Great Find|4|We had never been to this part of Providence and was very pleased with our dinner experience at Cook & Brown. The food was excellent as well as the service. We were early for our dinner reservation so we took a walk at the park across the street. That was very nice also. We'll definately return to Cook & Brown during our next visit to Providence and explore more of the Hope Street district.
June 6, 2014|Portions|4|The half size portion of the pasta was a bit small, but tasted really good.
May 22, 2014|Superb|5|We do not dine out often, usually preferring our own cooking at home. Every once in a while we will go out and splurge...and meet disappointment. Not at Cook & Brown. Cuisine there is smart and inventive. Handmade gnocchi is not glopped with sauce ruining its delicate textures, but thoughtfully tossed with pistachios and grapefruit nuggets (really! it works!) adding to the jazzy texture. Broccoli rabe with breadcrumbs: simple, fresh, spot on. Smoky pork/beef ragu that is densely flavorful. Everything is serving in an unpretentious manner by knowledgably informed wait staff. Could not recommend this restaurant highly enough.
May 21, 2014|Disappointed|1|"On a recent Wednesday night, two friends and I made our first visit to Cook & Brown. We had made reservations weeks in advance for a 5:30 pm dinner - they opened at 5:00. We were told that that 3 of the 4 side dishes on the menu were ""sold out"". This left only roasted beets as an option. After all I had read on previous reviews about the fresh local ingredients, I was very disappointed. More so since I had arrived early and had time to stroll the Farmers Market adjacent to the restaurant at Lippit Park. I wanted to suggest that the cook should go get some potatoes at least. We did not stay for dinner."
May 11, 2014|Neighborhood gem|5|Fantastic brunch at a very reasonable price. The best home fries I've had in years. Probably the best scratch bar in Providence. A super talented crew makes every visit great!
April 5, 2014|disappoimted|2|Could have been much better. An expensive restaurant run by people who do not understand the quality or experience necessary in running an expensive restaurant. Not bad.....but disappointed that our experience was not that good.
April 5, 2014|Alaways a great night out for dinne|5|Always great food and service. Extensive wine list. You have to be a wine connoisseur to follow it but the waiter and waitress are always very helpful. Have been there a number of times and have always had a great meal and a great experience.
April 4, 2014|Unique and lovely|4|My boyfriend and I had a wonderful meal last night. Like last time I was seated in the best table (all windows, up front). I'm very flattered to have been seated here twice. The place is actually quite cavernous and the more recessed tables aren't as charming. The opentable menu wasn't up to date, which was unfortunate because I was looking forward to ordering the monkfish (which, in all fairness is going out of season now). The food wasn't as sublime as I remember but it was nonetheless very good. The highlight was the parsnip soup, which I enjoyed a great deal, as well as a unique wine from grapes harvested in the rich volcanic soil of Sicily's Mt. Etna.
March 29, 2014|beyond exceptional !!!!!|5|this is our favorite restaurant in providence !! food is superb ,the servers and staff are wonderful !! the bartenders deserve special praise on their own. The very unique cocktails they are mixing up are exquisite !! you can tell the whole crew is proud of what they serve and that makes it an all around great experience. the menu is always changing so each visit is like a new experience! thank you Cook and Brown for another great evening !!!! kudos to chef Nemo ,one of the best !!
March 6, 2014|The service was excellent.|3|The service was excellent. Wines by the glass were very limited, and there were no California or other American wines at all. Menu was also very limited (4). The Bibb salad was delicious. The ambience was not great. The lighting is very poor.
February 19, 2014|Wednesday Burgers, Beer and Bourbon|3|This review is only really for the $20 burgers, beers and bourbon special on weds night. And yes, you get both beed AND bourbon. The burger was delicious, perfectly cooked, beef that is tender and well seasoned and comes with a side of chips (actual chips, not fries). This is a great deal! I have been to C&B for regular dinner and brunch before as well. I wasn't too impressed by the dinner but brunch was good. I will definitely be returning for dinner as the menu does change and perhaps I went on an off day. Also they have AMAZING craft cocktails!
February 14, 2014|Did not live up to previous visits|2|"The wait for our reserved table was too long so we took seats at the bar. The bartender was excellent--cheery, and accommodating. And the cocktail, the 'Frenet Me Not,"" was well balanced and delicious. But the kitchen was so backed up that our dinner stretched over three hours, and not a single dish was a real winner. The uni custard was relatively flavorless, the pasta overcooked, the short-rib dish too dark and rich (braised meat, crispy chips AND sweetbreads?!). The meal was not without its brighter points--The Beets, Pork Torchon, and Fluke (which I believe had been switched to Scallops) offered thoughtful, often tasty bites, but still suffered from errors in cooking, balance, or general flavor. I know this chef and kitchen are better."
February 14, 2014|I was very excited to go to|2|"I was very excited to go to the restaurant, but we had a pretty terrible experience here on Valentine's Day. First, we had a reservation, but still had to stand awkwardly at the packed bar for 15 minutes before getting our table. Then it began - 2 and a half hours of waiting. Waiting for our order to be taken, waiting at least 30 minutes between each course if not more. Worse, several courses were lackluster and seemed to be thrown together. I think the kitchen was extremely overwhelmed. When we got there, the Valentine's special steak was already sold out, probably because the special menu was less than exciting. My ""ricotta cake"" dessert tasted like someone cut up some store-bought angel food cake and tossed it on to a spilt fruit cup."
February 14, 2014|Valentine's Pre fixe|2|Even with only three options for dinner, the service was very slow. Reservations were being seated 40 minutes after their reservation time. At one point, more than half the tables had no food. The table next to us, who ordered steak, waited 2 hours for their entree. A mushroom dish was flavorless but flabby and slimy. The food overall was fair to bad. Even the fresh bread was so tough it was difficult to bite through while maintaining my table manners. And one would think that for a dinner that cost $150 for 2 we would be provided with enough butter to cover at least one piece of bread and not have to sink to arm wrestling over the tiny pat of butter. The wine, however, was excellent, which prevented the evening from being a complete loss.
February 1, 2014|Great meal, fantastic service|4|The food at Cook & Brown is amazing. The portions are just right and the flavors will bowl you over. Do not leave without trying the rice pudding with salted caramel for dessert. As for the ambiance, the bar and restaurant area is one big open room. The noise can be a bit much when the place is nearly full, like on a Saturday night. But the wonderful food and excellent service makes up for the noise.
January 25, 2014|I am always in search for|5|I am always in search for a great nearby restaurant that serves an interesting menu using fresh ingredients and local flavors with out costing a fortune. Brown and Cook reminds me of the interesting neighborhood restaurants nestled in Russian HIll in San Francisco. A place that you could dine at a couple nights a week and never get bored with the menu or go broke. The food was excellent. The staff was very knowledgable and the owner Nemo is very involved in your dining experience ready to answer any question you may have or make a great recommendation.
January 17, 2014|Great find.|5|Excellent food, excellent service, can't ask for much more than that.
January 10, 2014|We'll be back!|5|"Delicious and definitely ""fit for foodies"", but not too pretentious either. Original dishes and great cocktails!"
January 7, 2014|Get the rice pudding!|4|My friends and I went for Restaurant Week so that we could try great menu items at a discounted price. The service was fantastic, but we were the only people in the place (chalk that up to the Polar Vortex?). Everything was delicious, but I wasn't awed by anything but the salted caramel rice pudding. All four of us agreed the pudding was a religious experience worth going back for.
December 31, 2013|A very Happy New Year|5|We picked this restaurant because of seating availability on the busy New Years Eve. We were pleasantly surprised to enjoy attentive service and delicious food on what can be a very busy dining day. We will be back soon.
December 13, 2013|Overall good|4|No complaints, except wish the waitstaff was a little more attentive.
December 7, 2013|Elegant food, casual atmosphere|4|This is a neighborhood gem that is also worth driving to if you don't live in the neighborhood. The casual environment with its busy bar is very comfortable and it belies the fact that the food is so thoughtfully prepared. Our server was quite knowledgeable and friendly. The wine list is a bit thin (I'm partial to California wines), but the cocktails are such a hit that I gravitate toward them instead every time I dine there. Cook & Brown is a very enjoyable dining experience.
November 22, 2013|I almost hate even writing|5|I almost hate even writing this review in fear that Cook and Brown will get even more popular. This place is all about the food and the alcohol. Bartenders are mix masters and create amazing drinks. Food is for true food lovers who can appreciate flavor profiles and combinations. Already looking forward to going back soon.
November 22, 2013|Delicious and Brave|4|I dined with a friend on a Friday night--not our first time at Cook and Brown. The menu is small and adventurous, designed by a creative chef, and different every time you come. We shared everything and the friendly wait staff made sure we had enough plates and extra flatware for the Hubbard squash soup, a light fresh greens salad, the very naughty crispy pork belly with lentils, the loin of pork with beans and baby turnips (or were they radishes?) and a generous bowl of creamy rice pudding smothered in a salted caramel sauce. Everything was delicious, but the rice pudding made us swoon. My friend loved the hard-crust bread. I wasn't so crazy about it or the hip-hop music I could hear just under the diner's voices, glad it wasn't loud.
November 2, 2013|nov2|5|Great meal, ambiance with fantastic out of the ordinary cocktails. The noise level just at the acceptable level for us older folk with hearing issues.
October 26, 2013|A fine setting for conversation|4|A friend recommended Cook & Brown when I asked about a good place for dinner and conversation and it turned out to be ideal for that purpose. The service was exceptionally considerate and helpful and the menu was varied and interesting. I would return there for similar reasons whenever in Providence again.
Dined on October 19, 2013|Great cocktails, food|5|"Perhaps one of the best bartenders on the east coast, go for the ""bartender's choice"" option. Great neighborhood place, could even be worth driving a bit out of the way!"
October 9, 2013|Great staff concerned with|5|Great staff concerned with your dinning experience. Willing to make sure the food is to your liking and will redo it if it is not. Fun tasty cocktails, nice wines and really good food.
September 29, 2013|Mixed|3|Mixed review: 3 of our diners elected the chef dinner. The let it be known they are vegetarians except for fish, which they do eat. Appetizer was excellent. No one liked the main course of fried fish. ALso deep fried was the broccoli and part of the appetizer. Vegans tend be health conscious and I think it was too much fried stuff. Our 4th diner had steak, found it uninspiring but acceptable.
September 10, 2013|Unique setting. Low key alternative|4|Unique setting. Low key alternative type environment. Delicious food.
September 5, 2013|What a Dissapointment|2|I had visited this restaurant about three years ago and really enjoyed it. I decided to meet a friend here and what a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT it was. The food was terrible and not what I remembered from my last experience. It appears as if the restaurant was managed by new owners or a new Chef. Definitely a place I would not visit nor recommend again. I'm extremely dissapointed at my experience here, after a great visit three years ago, I leave with a bad taste in my mouth, unfortunately!
September 1, 2013|Slipped a little|3|Entrees were lack luster and the flavors bland. Desserts consistently excellent.
August 31, 2013|Good Food|3|The cocktail drinks were normal good, nothing special or unique. The food was also good, but nothing out of the ordinary, so much that I do not recall the name of the plates. It is good food, but there are definitely better options in the same range around Providence.
August 24, 2013|Reliably very fine|5|I visit Cook and Brown fairly often since I live in the neighborhood. The food is always delicious and is often inventive. The bar manager is superb; I always name a main ingredient for my drink and ask her to improvise; the result is fantastic. My friend had a fabulous cosmo that redefined what can be a pretty boring, watered-down drink. My one wish: that one vegan option and one additional vegetarian option (there's always just one) would appear on the menu. A chef as creative as the one at C&B can do amazing things without using flesh! There are a lot of us vegetarians around these days, and some restaurants have more veg offerings. Still, I'll be back at Cook and Brown. It's too good to miss.
August 23, 2013|Fantastic|5|I took a friend who was visiting to dinner there this past weekend. The menu may be small but it was delicious. We split the the mussel appetizer (which was delicious!) and I had the ricotta gnocchi. It was amazing! The wait service was pretty good as well, though I thought it took awhile for our drinks to come out, given the number of people in the restaurant. However, that was a minor inconvenience. Overall we had a fantastic time and I wowed my friend with a delicious dining experience.
August 23, 2013|ook & Brown Public House is|5|ook & Brown Public House is great option to all the same old Providence places. This is better than most and a real foodie find... Worth the short ride out of downtown and away from noise of Atwells Ave
August 3, 2013|Spectacular from Top to Bottom|5|My husband and I happened upon Cook & Brown while on vacation and couldn't have been more pleased. Every facet of the evening - the decor, the food, service, drinks, menu options - EVERYTHING was wonderful. One of our favorite things about the restaurant was that the passion for innovative yet delicious food and drink was evident, and the atmosphere of the entire restaurant radiated comfort and warmth. I look forward to returning!
July 20, 2013|has become our favorite restaurant|5|has become our favorite restaurant !! the food is outstanding!
July 20, 2013|I actually expected a bit more|3|Having read many good reviews, I was expecting a place with a more intimate ambience, and a bit better food. What one finds is a simple dining room, with hardwood floors, and simple butcher block dining tables. All of the hard spaces lead to somewhat elevated noise levels. I also thought the prices were a bit high for the quality of the food ($10 for a small bowl of corn soup was ridiculous, although it was quite tasty). The cocktails we had were mediocre as well, which was a disappointment based on the way the place is known.
July 17, 2013|Tasty as always|4|We've been to C&B many times, and the food is always top-notch. One of us had the Restaurant Week meal, the other ordered off the menu, and both were terrific. The Bluefish fritters with the horseradish aioli barely stayed on the plate, and our daiquiri was a deliciously alcoholic version of the Yacht Up soda beside it. (The Rosita we ordered later, however, was a bit on the alcoholic side - kind of like drinking jet fuel). The Fried Chicken and Bolognese plates were also amazing - you've never had such crispy, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth fried chicken. The side of greens was too bitter, but the grits and sweet pea slaw were eye-opening. One note about our Wednesday night dinner was that service was a bit on the slow and confused side.
July 7, 2013|beyond my expectation|5|I arrived 6pm Sunday, but there is not many customers. I don't really know the menu before going there and hear the suggestions. I ordered chicken liver pate, swordfish and lemon tart, and taste of food is beyond my expectation. I shall definitely visit Cook & Brown again.
June 21, 2013|Accommodating, warm, inviting|5|Not familiar with providence, I asked a friend where my family & I should eat on our way up to Cape Cod from NYC. He recommended this place. It was just perfect! They were friendly, attentive, and warm. An the food was just lovely. I can imagine this place as being a neighborhood staple if I lived in the neighborhood.
June 16, 2013|Wonderful restaurant and bar|5|LOVED this place and am plotting my return.There was a daily small plate list, and a seasonal menu. Food is beautifully presented and tastes even better! American cuisine with a contemporary flair. Beer list has the best of local microbrews, there is an extensive wine and an impressive selection of liquor. There are some suggested cocktails which are complex and interesting. They can make anything, usually people haven't heard of our request. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive.
June 15, 2013|Interesting cocktails/great food|4|The Cook and Brown has great food, especially the appetizers and the cocktails are complex, unusual and delicious. Great wine list too. The service was great. The chicken wings were very spicy, hot and huge. Prices were very reasonable. Great for a special occasion.
June 9, 2013|The food was delicious! The|4|The food was delicious! The menu is simple, yet slightly eclectic. I went on a Sunday night with a small group and it was perfect. The restaurant is small, but well laid out and making reservations online is incredibly easy.
June 2, 2013|Excellent Sunday supper -|4|Excellent Sunday supper - delicious food, enthusiastic staff - and a really well-paced meal.
May 30, 2013|Always new|5|We had a wonderful experience at Cook & Brown. All dishes were fresh and prepared perfectly. Service and ambiance was great. Only down side is menu is a bit limited and only local sodas for non drinkers.
May 18, 2013|Great spot|4|Food was exceptional and reasonably priced. Waitress was a bit over anxious but other than that, great experience.
May 18, 2013|Fresh and Innovative!|5|We went this weekend to celebrate my daughters graduation from college and my parents from Cape May joined us. First off, the service was terrific, attentive and we were not rushed! We wanted to relax and enjoy. The beer selection and wine selection were very interesting and a few I had not seen before. Highly recommend the pate, ceviche, but all were fabulous.The peanuts on the pate appetizer were terrific, I forgot to ask how they were flavored. I had the bluefish with braised endive, it just melted in my mouth and the bluefish was not oily tasting as it sometimes can be. A home run was gnocchi with fiddleheads and my mother adored the fettuccine with mussels. Dad raved about the asparagus soup. I cannot wait to go back.
May 12, 2013|Mother's Day Treat|5|This is a great place for a romantic night out or dinner with friends. It was pleasant but not too casual. My husband and I shared the chicken liver pate which was yummy. I then had the sword fish with lentils - flavorfull and and the swordfish was tender and delicate. My husband had the chicken and cavatelli - good, slightly spicy. We shared the chocolate bread pudding which was delicious. The service was attentive but not pushy. Portions were just right- leaving you room for a dessert. I enjoy a pre dinner cocktail but the choices were a little exotic for me. My husband found his glass of beer very small - it was like a juice glass. Having different size options for the beers would please my husband as he found himself thirsty.
May 4, 2013|Great Food and Aims to Please|4|"The dining experience on Saturday, May 4, 2013 was great. Food choices were all outstanding and the staff was very attentive. They asked if we needed to have the music turned down, did not rush us to finish our meal, and kept asking if everything was okay. Maybe they did that a bit too much, but I thought they were ""aiming to please"" since 2 of us in the party of 4 had never been to Cook and Brown before. Everything was great until the end of the night when the tea water was cold, no spoons were presented with the coffee, and we had to wait for one cup of coffee. This ending made what had been a great night, just a bit disappointing. However, I will definitely return."
April 27, 2013|We had a very nice dinner|4|"We had a very nice dinner of monkfish and mussels, and although a couple of mussels were a bit gritty overall the food was fantastic and the service very friendly and attentive. It was awfully crowded on a Saturday night, and our late-add reservations stuck us in the elevated ""display window"" table near the bar, but the food we had was definitely *not* something we could have prepared ourselves, and was very good and interesting to eat. Our ""Hi-Q"" cocktail was also refreshingly different and good."
April 24, 2013|As always, C&B was a wonderful|5|As always, C&B was a wonderful choice to bring out of town guests (my father in law and his new wife), who raved over the 'unique and creative' menu, the fabulous cocktails, and the local ingredients. Wonderful to have a neighborhood restaurant that takes its craft so seriously
April 19, 2013|A great neighborhood bistro;|4|A great neighborhood bistro; very fresh food; informal setting. Lots of people at the bar on a Friday night made it a bit noisy, but it wasn't unbearable. Great draught beers and original dishes--I loved the light ricotta gnocchi with red radishes and a radish-green pesto. My dad has a great lemon-herb risotto with very tender lamb.
April 13, 2013|Found a rotting beet in my|2|"Found a rotting beet in my beet salad, soup and entrees were over-salted, entrees were lukewarm (as if they were sitting out for a while), tables placed randomly in the ""dining room"" so either you felt as if you were dining with your neighbors or you were a lone table on display. Seems to be a very disorganized operation."
April 13, 2013|We were enjoying the ambiance|4|We were enjoying the ambiance and the service and were overall impressed with the restaurant until the entree's arrived. We shared our meals, the beef with noodles and the risotto. the risotto was more interesting than the beef but neither was very good and we wouldn't order these again.
March 17, 2013|The pork shoulder was well-prepared|4|The pork shoulder was well-prepared and tasty. A simple salad was perfect: not over-dressed and with crisp clean lettuce. The entree could have been heated more. Interesting bar menu.
March 9, 2013|The menu was interesting and|3|The menu was interesting and the food was good. On the negative side- the drink pours were really minimal and the fish portion way too small. Prices were on the high side, but the small portions and short drinks will certainly keep us from returning. The waitstaff also need more training; had to ask for more salad dressing numerous times.
March 2, 2013|Best meal I've had yet. Appetizer|4|Best meal I've had yet. Appetizer course was so filling and delicious it could have been dinner. We shared a shaved salad and the roasted pig tails on the advice of the waiter. Followed up with a scallop plate and a lemon sole dish, both of which were very good, but just couldn't compete with the awesomeness of the pig tails. I could write the rest of this review just about the pork belly. The entire night was great, with the typical very well balanced cocktails, and of course attentive but unobtrusive staff. pig tails should be on the menu more often...8)
February 15, 2013|Service was great, restaurant|5|Service was great, restaurant was small and cozy, and food was delicious! Our main courses were great as was the salad my husband got. Wanted to order a starter or a dessert, but the choices on the night we went weren't what we'd wanted (only reason I gave a 4 for food). Drink selection was great though, so we had fun with that instead! Will definitely go back -- the service was fabulous and can't wait to try what other things come up on the menu!
February 14, 2013|Our second visit to Cook &|5|Our second visit to Cook & Brown Public House, each one truly enjoyable. The Valentine's Day menu was limited only in choices, not in the quality and truly amazing taste sensations. We expect to be returning on a regular basis.

January 31, 2013|Not sure if it was just an|3|Not sure if it was just an off night or a sign of a restaurant slipping, but our dinner was just than or below average. While the server was very pleasant, we waited an exceptionally long time for our entrees - they did offer us 2 appetizers to make up for this (our meals took SO long that these were served one at a time). When our entrees actually arrived, they were not as good as we've had in the past - really nothing special. I think the best part was that a member of our party had a dietary restriction that they were more than able to accommodate. To be honest, not sure if we will go back to Cooke & Browne - other than for drinks/apps.
January 22, 2013|Simply outstanding in every|5|Simply outstanding in every way. Service was top notch. Food was simple, elegant and delicious. Cocktails are a real speciality too.
January 19, 2013|Awesome Food, Phenomenal Drinks|4|The first time I went to Cook and Brown was for drinks. Jenn, the alchemist leading the bar staff, is insanely good. It was during my second trip that I explored the food menu. First of all, the staff is super-friendly and attentive. We were seated promptly and they gave excellent meal recommendations. We did spend most of the night really confused about who exactly was our server. There were so many different people attending to our table. There was, however, no flaws with our food. Our appetizers, Bluefish Fritters and Poutine were downright magnificent. The steak tips and shallots were simply delicious and the lime curd parfait brought the biggest smile to my face! However, the bar is Cook and Brown's greatest attraction!
January 4, 2013|Excellent food, service and|5|Excellent food, service and ambiance. Would definitely go there again.

December 31, 2012|Great until it picked up...|3|I had a great experience on NYE, until the place picked up a bit and suddenly the service declined. Although, the courses came out in a timely fashion, we had to wait an extended period to receive our dessert. This left us annoyed and at that point we just wanted our check. Other than that, our food was great and I would still recommend this restaurant to others.
December 21, 2012|We ordered a smoked cod brandide|3|We ordered a smoked cod brandide for an appetizer. It was basically a mashed potatoe dish with little or no fish. They apologized and offered us the bluefish fritters as a substitute. They were delicious! The kale salad was also fantastic, with filberts and dried cherries. The entree we shared was rabbit with white bean cassoulet for $26. We were expecting a stew-like meal w/tender meat cooked with beans, spices, etc. Rich and flavorful. Instead we received a very small portion of a bean dish w/slices of separately cooked rabbit on the side. The beans were a little crunchy and underspiced. Even taking into consideration we split the entree, it was a skimpy portion. How expensive are beans and spices? The service was excellent
December 20, 2012|Will Cross the Bridge from Bristol|5|i hesitate to give this place good ratings for totally selfish reasons-- i don't want this to become so busy that you have to wait in line-- but i would if i had to.. the menu changes-- the chef uses local and seasonal foods............ GREAT service... fantastic menu (limited to me is better then a large menu with stuff that gets pulled from the freezer.)sweet dining area.. great experience each time we come -- we meet here prior to going to the Gamm...
December 1, 2012|A few minor issues...|3|"This was our second visit following a very good first visit. The food was once again of high quality at reasonable cost. This time however, there were 2 issues from the members of my party. We ""get"" the ever changing limited menu options, however this time some members of the group did not feel there was enough diversity among the offerings to satisfy different palettes. And, like the first visit, we wish the martini's were a little more generous given the cost (notwithstanding the ala carte component pricing). We do like the vibe of the place, and will return."
November 3, 2012|High Quality Cuisine Well Priced!|5|Our first trip. A rare combination of terrific high quality cuisine at a reasonable price! Two at our table enjoyed a chicken creation, one had the gnocchi and I enjoyed a monkfish dish in an absolutely superb piquant sauce. All the entrees were outstanding! The appetizers of bluefish fritters and honey apple salad were likewise excellent. Recognizing that fine food is about quality and not quantity, I did think that a tad more fish in my dish was appropriate, though the sauce it came in was so good nothing else could detract from the eating pleasure. As long as the quality and value remain this high, C&B will be a regular on our Providence restaurant rotation!
November 2, 2012|A casual night out|3|The staff was very nice and experienced. The bartenders are the stars. We sat near the bar and willingly interrupted our conversations to watch the different style of shaking mixed drinks. This is a place for mixed drinks. The wine list is short and very French. We appreciated the attempt at some original food combinations. We had gnocchi and mushrooms with egg noodles. The gnocchi was well prepared with a texture resembling scallops but a little plain. The pumpkin (?) sauce with roasted seeds and a few beets provided some variation in texture and a little salt. regarding the mushroom dish, the subtle flavor of mushrooms in was overwhelmed by the sauce. The egg noodle were had good flavor a firm texture.
October 27, 2012|"I give this a ""good"" review."|3|"I give this a ""good"" review. Have eaten here three times. The first was for a brunch and it was good. Second for dinner and it was very good. But the third time, which was for dinner, was not very good. I found the dish that I had ordered to have a bad taste. I should have sent it back but instead I just didn't eat much of it. So I'd say this restaurant can vary."
October 27, 2012|a chill neighborhood bistro|3|We went on Saturday night. The food was very good as was the service. The menu and the wine list was limited, just a few okay wines and lots of meat and dairy on the menu. It's a nice non-pretentious sort of place though the ambiance was a bit dark. It was a friendly and open but serious place, and I was a little thrown off to see children there though it didn't bother me. I thought it was going to be more romantic that it was. I think the vibe they are trying to strike is that it can be whatever you want it to be, so it works as a neighborhood bistro, a romantic night out place, a bring along the 6 year old place, for everyday and for special occasions. Cook is able to pull all that off which is impressive.
October 16, 2012|Went on a slow tuesday night:|5|Went on a slow tuesday night: Creative menu of farm-fresh ingredients cooked perfectly, trendy and calm ambience and friendly service although dinner for 2 took nearly two hours.
October 13, 2012|Great food! Ok service|5|The food was phenomenal from start to finish. Out waitress was not very personable. She was kind I stuffy and didn't really attend to us. We got better service from the bus boy. The drinks were amazing. Definitely a place we will go back too!!
October 12, 2012|The food is eclectic and innovative|4|The food is eclectic and innovative. The cost rating is more like $$$-$$$$ not $$.
October 2, 2012|good stuff|4|I had an enjoyable experience. The burger was great. The beer list was of about 10 to choose from but they were all craft beers which is what I love.
September 29, 2012|Baby Boomer Foodie|5|A fantastic night out. Prices were reasonable for top notch cuisine. Only item we couldn't justify was price of wine per glass $10-13 per. We all had a beer.
September 28, 2012|Best in New England, worth the trip|5|Once again, simply wonderful. Whenever we are in Providence, or for that matter New England, we stop at C&B. Chef Bolin never disappoints, nor does the restaurant. Cocktails were inspired, a great mix of sweet and bitter across the flavor spectrum. Beer menu excellent, as is the wine list. Chef Bolin cooked for us off menu - highlight was the whole miso butter Giannone Chicken served in a cast iron skillet next to a Hen of the Woods Mushroom (same size as the chicken), foraged that morning, over whole potatoes and skin on garlic with rosemary. OUTSTANDING. The smoked swordfish course was another favorite. The Barolo Chinato Cocchi wine pairing with dessert was out of this world, and a great surprise to find on the menu. 5 stars.
September 28, 2012|Disappointing tasting menu|1|Three of us had the tasting menu which was a real disappointment. It started with mushroom tempura...greasy and with little flavor. The next course was a small piece of fluke which was also lacking in flavor. The entree was peking duck (extremely small piece) with several overcooked mini pancakes (size of a silver dollar). We have had good meals there in the past...not sure if the cook was on holiday but we may not return.
September 21, 2012|Great experience! Great options|5|Great experience! Great options for the vegetarian. Restaurant supports the local farmers!!!
September 20, 2012|Inventive and balanced main menu|5|Very interesting and inventive food- taste and textures. The wine list is small but thoughtful. Service was truly lovely. Wait staff attentive, warm but sensitive to privacy, very well informed and excited by the menu. The dessert menu did not measure up to the excellence in balance of the main menu. There is a cocktail menu that we ultimately did not order from that looked equally as interesting and inventive as the main food menu. The lighting is romantic but each table would benefit from additional lightening such as a candles.. The bar was not crowded on this Thursday evening but could accommodate a crowd and be very fun although it could raise the noise level in the whole room to untenable. Some good Vegetarian offerings.

August 17, 2012|Apps are the star|4|This was my third visit in the past few months with very different groups. This one was with an old friend for an easy-going meal focused on the food. The food was again well above average. The corn soup was extremely good. And the fried green tomatoes were also quite good. C&B is really good at appetizers. The main courses were also good but didn't quite rise to great. The noodles with a spicy lamb sausage sauce were quite good. The gnocchi a little less so, but still good. With a few experiences here, I'd have to say that the appetizers are the stars - get a few and enjoy. Then go light on entrees and desserts. I love blueberries but my dessert including them was not particularly dazzling. Overall, it was again a very good experience.
August 5, 2012|i really enjoy this spot.|4|i really enjoy this spot. Dinners vary somewhat in delectability, but they are original and cover a wide range of flavors and combinations that are unique and interesting.
August 1, 2012|First Visit of Hopefully Many|5|Inventive and delicious flavors on all plates, complimented by attentive, personable service. Great for the beginning or experienced foodie.
July 25, 2012|The evening we were there|2|The evening we were there there was only one waiter so service was on the slow side. Our before-dinner cocktails took an overly long time to arrive. My appetizer (corn soup) and entree (tuna) were both very good. My partner's entree (bluefish) was bland and unseasoned; the same with his vegetables. We are not in any hurry to return.
July 11, 2012|The restaurant is small, so|5|The restaurant is small, so large groups (over 10) would be difficult. That being said, this is a wonderful find. The food is outstanding and very green. This is restaurant week and I chose this menu. My husband did the regular menu. Everything was delicious.
July 5, 2012|Wish this was MY neighborhood gem!|4|Second visit in a week, between the great meal and convenience factor! Focus is on fresh ingredients, well prepared. Olive oil poached bluefish was excellent. Didnt love the gnocchi. A little too chewy for me, but everybody likes their own grandma's way best, like matzo balls. Definite go-to when anywhere near Providence.
July 1, 2012|Great Chef's Tasting Menu!|4|In RI from California, we decided to try this little spot. Had great cocktails before dinner. We had the Sunday chef's tasting menu, tailored to our preferences. Everything was a hit. My husband loved the quail, which is unheard of! I expected to eat most of it, but he dug in and got every last bit of yummy meat on dem little bones! Great lamb chops, a bonus roasted marrow bone. Loved it all! Excellent service too!
June 30, 2012|U Can't Go Wrong With Cook & Brown|5|Cook & Brown is a fantastic restaurant. It is small and cozy but it's filled with warm and personable staff. My friend and I were going because I had taken her for brunch a couple months ago and she wanted to try it out for dinner. She was blown away. They never flinched when I wanted to change up something on the tasting menu...the waiter and told us the kitchen loves a challenge. They came up with something so delicious and still went well with the original wine pairing. If you get a chance go check out Cook & Brown...you won't be sorry!
June 29, 2012|I had the pleasure of dining|5|I had the pleasure of dining here twice in one week - once with my two young children and once with my wife. Going early with the kids was great. C&B can easily whip up kid-standards like basic pastas, but luckily mine are adventurous eaters and had soft shell crab, gnocci and a burger. My two year old loved the couscous in a fava bean puree that came with my hake. Bring your own crayons for the craft-paper on the tables. With my wife, we went for the 4 course prix fixe with wine. Great timing of courses and sized to fill you but not stuff you. The sunflower-filled ravioli were outstanding. Sunflower seed pesto may be my next experiment at home with this inspiration. Well worth seeking it out.
June 23, 2012|Wonderful Dining Experience!|5|Amazing food and excellent service. We had superb appetizers (e.g., clams casino, bluefish fritters, and beef tongue) along with delectable main courses of rib eye steak cooked perfectly and swordfish.
June 16, 2012|Delicious|4|We both had the tasting menu and it was amazing. The wine pairings were very complimentary. Service was spot-on and would definitely recommend and will be going back.

June 8, 2012|5 year anniversary|4|Food was interesting and very good. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. My wife had the four course tasting menu. It was good but very small amounts for the cost. I had the shirred eggs and a rib eye steak which was enough to feed a lumber jack, also very good! I would recommend this spot for a five year anniversary!
June 3, 2012|Local, simple menu, satisfying|3|The new format is a great improvement over Oak. I love the focus on local produce. Menu is simple and basic, but generally good. Lots of comfort food.
June 2, 2012|Service poor. Waited too long|3|Service poor. Waited too long to be greeted by server. Server had a bad attitude. Food was good but overpriced for what it was. They even got my bill wrong in the end. Will not be returning.
June 2, 2012|nice little splurge on Hope Street|4|"Very nice ""splurge"" restaurant in what appears to be an ""up and coming"" area of Hope Street. For about $ 65 each, my group of 5 enjoyed a beverage, an appetizer, an entree and a dessert (we split all of the desserts - the 3 ""winners"": key lime pie parfait, fried mini donuts/pudding/whipped cream and the rice pudding w/caramel)"

May 19, 2012|Found this lovely place for|4|Found this lovely place for Brunch during a trip to see Brown University and it was a delicious meal. Worth going just for the rhubarb pie that wasn't for dessert but served straight from the oven before the main meal, with a side of whipped cream. Who needed more? The next day at our run of the mill hotel buffet breakfast i was dreaming of that tiny but delicious pie. Yes the rest of the meal was pretty good too and i would most certainly return if said child decided to go to school near there!
May 18, 2012|Dissatified diners!|2|"We were a few minutes early for our reservation & we're told we could sit at the bar only seats were ""reserved"" and unavailable. We stood in the very small & busy entry area & had to constantly move around (drinks in hand) to get out of the way. Bread plates were on the table but no bread offered. WE requested bread/rolls having had to wait quite awhile for our entrees. Waitstaff was apologetic & attentive. Wine list very good & versatile. Pork was ordered medium but arrived well done & was dry/chewy. Ricotta gnocchi w/rabi and (vegetarian substitute) cavatelli w/rabi & carrots were tasteless. Food needs to be more flavorful. No imagination in putting together a vegetarian dish even with a ""heads up"" phone call! Noise level too high!"
May 16, 2012|Always Perfect|5|Stop by and have wine, beer, or a special cocktail at the bar, or sit down for a complete meal. Always perfect.
May 11, 2012|Took my sister there for dinner|5|Took my sister there for dinner after she had just flown in from Georgia. Salads, oysters and cod with martinis and wine. Everything was over the top including our waiter, who is from Chicago and new to the area
May 5, 2012|Every detail of the meal,|5|Every detail of the meal, the service and the inventive and incredible drinks was absolutely amazing. The flavor and texture combinations are well thought through and work well together. Anytime a scallop is poached in butter and lobster salad is topped with fried chicken skin, life is good.

April 12, 2012|The food was solid and well|3|"The food was solid and well thought through but perhaps as a result of the ""locally sourced and seasonally appropriate"" agenda the salads and entrees we had lacked distinctive taste. We had bib salad, seasonal salad, hake and steak tips. The place is clearly run by serious food people and the menu changes every night, so we will certainly give it another try."
April 8, 2012|My friend and I were disappointed|2|My friend and I were disappointed with our experience at Cook and Brown on Easter Sunday. We had been looking forward to the experience, especially considering the chef’s recent nomination for a James Beard Award. I wasn’t expecting the executive chef to be churning out brunch on Easter Sunday, but I was still expecting quality food and service. The fried chicken sandwich was good. The chicken was perfect but the cole slaw was under seasoned. The teacakes lacked the pear and walnut flavors advertised. While our waiter was inattentive, unable to answer questions about the menu and disappeared from the dining room after taking our orders leaving the bussers, back waiters and host to cover for him. Overall, a disappointing experience.

March 11, 2012|Local and National Quality|5|Second time here. Excellent cocktails, local and interesting dishes. Salt cod fritters with habanero sauce were perfect for my wife, and she is very picky about her fritters. I had the pig tails for the app, and they were a large bowl of roasted, bbq'd tails that were meaty and crunchy with a great sherry vinegar burnt caramel glaze. Entree was the local skate (best I've had) with a brown butter sauce. Dessert was a substantial rice pudding with caramel. Great meal!
March 11, 2012|Disappointed|2|I had been wanting to visit this restaurant for awhile because I've heard such great things about it. Went for brunch and had the chicken confit and root vegetable hash. It was extremely salty! I had to eat it with my toast and eggs and drank lots of water to help it all go down. It was disappointing because I think it would have been really tasty had it not been loaded with salt. I prob should have said something to our server but I thought maybe it was just me because I don't cook with a lot of salt. But then my friend tried it and said she thought it was inedible. She had the bacon potato cakes which she enjoyed although she felt the greens that came on the side were overdressed. However, the pear and walnut tea cakes were delicious.
March 10, 2012|Ordered the tasting menu.|4|Ordered the tasting menu. Crab and lobster courses were fresh and well prepared. Lamb was absolutely delicious. Dessert involved a freshly fried donut in chocolate sauce with a vanilla a granita; donut was perfect but the granita was mostly melted by the time it arrived. Service was attentive without being intrusive.
February 26, 2012|Amazing brunch!! What a find.|5|Amazing brunch!! What a find. Fair prices for locally sourced, fresh delicious food. Love that you are open for brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, and that you take reservations. So much more enjoyable than waiting for a table on Broadway.

February 14, 2012|Wonderful waitress. Hilarious|3|Wonderful waitress. Hilarious cocktail recipes. A tiny-portioned menu that might have been created by Bret Easton Ellis. Virtually bare decor leads one to believe that they're implying that the art is on the plate. Probably heaven for foodies, but if you prize traditional tastes over extraneous adventurousness, it might not be for you.
January 18, 2012|Love everything about this|5|Love everything about this restaurant and go as often as possible. The mixologists are caring and amazingly inventive, the wait staff is professional but warm, and the food is just right. It's AUTHENTIC -- not a pretentious bone in its body.
January 6, 2012|Thumbs up for Cook and Brown|5|My boyfriend and I went to Cook and Brown for a fancy date night. It was the first time either of us ate at Cook and Brown and neither of us were disappointed. Both the food and the drinks were wonderful. The wait staff was very responsive and helpful answering all our questions about the menu. I would definitely suggest Cook and Brown to anyone wanting to try gastropub style food.
December 31, 2011|Another Amazing Brunch|5|As always, C&B didn't disappoint with a fabulous brunch. Our Savory Bread Pudding and Root Vegetable & Pork Belly Hash were sublime. They even broke out the dessert menu when we asked, and we had amazing Apple Cider Donuts with an Early Grey custard. All that plus two drinks, and the total tab was thirty bucks. Can't beat it.
December 29, 2011|A place for foodies, but not for ev|4|This chef owned restaurant has amazing food and great service. I would have given it five stars except for a couple of minor points. First, the room is rather minimal and many of the tables are far too small for fine dining .The glass front makes it inviting from the outside, but is a distraction inside. We were seated under the speakers and found the choices of music less than idea. Although the food is spot on, the menu is rather limited. There were only about four entrees and two were vegetarian and one was pork belly (which is a nice name for a chunk of bacon). No chicken at all. They are clearly aiming for the 20 and 30 year olds.
December 22, 2011|Cook and Brown Public House|4|Cook and Brown Public House was a hidden gem nestled in Hope Street. The menu was very well-crafted, and the combination of ingredients and flavors was a true inspiration to my taste buds! I went with a party of 3 and each of us tried a different salad, appetizer, entree, and dessert. Each of us shared with the other, and we were all impressed with each others choice. We would definitely visit Cook and Brown again for a special occasion, as the menu is a bit pricey. Two thumbs up!

December 3, 2011|Overall, a very nice experience.|4|Overall, a very nice experience. The pace of service was exactly what we requested. The food was fresh and delicious, although the number of entree choices was somewhat limited. The wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive, but disappeared at the right times and allowed us to enjoy the entire exoerience.
December 1, 2011|Slightly Off Tonight|3|This is a place that my spouse and I loved the first time we tried it as we found the food creative and flavorful with terrific service and nice ambience. On our repeat visit the food creativity was there but the execution left us with average tasting entree meals. Service and ambience remain very good to excellent. Will try again.

November 9, 2011|Highly Recommend|4|Awesome neighborhood restaurant and an excellent find. The space is small, but well utilized. We started at the bar and we received an expetly made bourbon old fashioned along with a nice glass of red. Service was excellent, and they didn't hesitate when asked about the wines and the cocktails. For dinner, we sat in the dining area and the food was great. Handmade pasta and gnocchi was excellent. Nice local field green salad and some fantastic bisque. If we lived closer, there's no question this would be a go to spot. The service was awesome. The host didn't hesitate to call us a cab so we could get to our show! Not only did he call a cab, but he made sure it was there when we needed it. Thank you
October 30, 2011|Food and service were out|5|Food and service were out of this world! Order an appetizer, though, as the entrees,, while superb, are a bit smaller than what us Rhode Islanders are used to. Go sooner rather than later to see what you've been missing.

Dined on October 22, 2011|Good food, atmosephere and service!|5|My husband and i moved to the East Side not that long ago and have heard wonderful things about Cook and Brown. We decided to go their for our wedding anniversary this weekend. It was amazing! We had a nice seat by the window and ordered appetizers, meals and dessert--everything tasted phenomanol! And, we loved how all the ingredients are local--even down to the soda! :) We will definitely go back! The one thing that did strike me odd was the choice of music--the atmosephere is quaint and romantic and the music was more beat-driven and club like. I noticed it right when I stepped in the door and it didn't seem to fit with what I thought the restaurant's style was, but other than that, the experience was wodnerful!

October 8, 2011|Great find, need more training...|4|Is it bad when the waiter brings over the desert menu? How about if he does it BEFORE he brings your entree? Other than particularly bad service (including forgetting my drink until he was reminded of it) and leaving our entrees on the warmer (or wherever) for quite awhile meaning our food was served late and lukewarm, and the aforementioned awkward moment of bringing over our desert menus before bringing over our entrees, it was really good. Actually the food (despite being lukewarm) was EXCELLENT. I mean five star quality. Portions were modest, so don't be afraid to get an appetizer (we had the salad with buttermilk dressing and it was just about perfect). Wine list is eclectic as is the drink menu. Menu is limit but interesting.

This place is JUST RIGHT and already a favorite -- have celebrated a wedding anniversary à deux, tried the amazing and creative cocktails sitting at the bar, and had a dinner with four friends. Each time it was just right!
September 14, 2011|Cook & Brown in Providence|5|Cook & Brown in Providence is one of those rare finds: a small restuarant where you can easily talk to each other over a low level of pleasant music and other diners' chatter. This, in itself, would make me go back, but then, add the amazing food cooked by Chef Nemo and his staff and I would have to rate this as one of our best dining experiences anywhere, and we eat out a lot all around the country.
September 13, 2011|This place is a great addition|5|This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. They are really kind to diners with children. I sent a note in advance that we had a baby we might need to walk outside and they placed us in a good location to walk out quickly if needed. We were fine , but appreciated the effort. One wish: cappuccino to accompany the stellar rice pudding with salted caramel.
September 10, 2011|Waitress was very inconsistent|3|Waitress was very inconsistent but food was very good.
September 3, 2011|C & B's execution of new American|4|C & B's execution of new American take on traditional Rhode Island menu was outstanding. Dishes were deconstructed, updated, and flavors were brights and distinguishable within the syncretic whole. Service was a little spacy and unpolished, but sincere. Dining chairs are hard and uncomfortable after a little while. But for the periodically clueless service and the chairs, we would have rated this five starts in every category. The food and its presentation are fabulous, equal to the best locavore driven cuisine anywhere. Prices were quite fair for this caliber of cuisine, given the modesty of the premises.
August 26, 2011|Upscale and creative, Cooke|5|Upscale and creative, Cooke & Brown varies its menu and uses fresh, local ingredients combined in unusual ways for the adventurous diner.
August 26, 2011|delicious dining on Hope Street|4|Comfortable neighborhood bistro with delicious appetizers and entrees. Interesting combinations perfectly executed. We particularly enjoyed the the peach and ricotta brushetta (smoky, sweet, creamy, soft, crunchy--all of the above) and the fritters. And the corn soup. Dessert was disappointing, adequate but did not live up to the rest of the meal. Well priced, given the quality. A place where the diner is satisfied by taste and texture, not by large portions.
August 19, 2011|C&B: Over-rated, on a slow decline|2|C&B has gone down-hill over the last 6 months. Perhaps Nemo's Beard nomination went to his head and he no longer monitors the quality of his food? We've been there many times, we'll never go back. First, the good: -our server Brian was lovely (it was his last night there) -the appetizers were fantastic, nice heirloom tomato salad, and a chicken of the woods mushroom dish -free bread The bad: -Entrees were awful; swordfish was so well done it was dry. The presentation on the scallops was unappetizing - smeared caper puree. Nothing was seasoned. It's called salt. We sent back half of each unfinished. -The rice-pudding needed sugar, the caramel was visibly burned. -The tiny cocktails are a huge rip-off, served in a champagne coupe
August 19, 2011|Neighborhood Feel, World-Class Food|5|I've now had half a dozen meals (dinners and brunches) at Cook & Brown. Every one has been exceptional. The menu changes often and always includes a creative, delicious vegetarian option for each course. The emphasis is on seasonal and local ingredients. There's a strong neighborhood presence that makes the place feel comfortable and relaxed. The staff is uniformly pleasant and helpful. Dinner is on the pricey side, but I always feel I've gotten what I've paid for.
August 18, 2011|wonderful food, artfully presented,|5|wonderful food, artfully presented, great but not overly-effusive service. The scallops were fresh and perfectly cooked. The lamb was also just perfect--tender and not overdone. And the waiter gave helpful advice, answered questions, even brought 2 samples of wine for us to try, but never seemed to be intrusive or get in the way of our conversation. I can't wait to return.
August 17, 2011|Food was good but not great.|3|Food was good but not great. Atmosphere was okay but not outstanding. We had a gift certificate and that's why we went there. We would not go out of our way to revisit this place.
August 12, 2011|I went with a friend, came|5|I went with a friend, came back again later that week, and then again the next day just for drinks. The drink specials were really wonderful and a treat that shouldn't be missed-- I say this as someone who usually only drinks wine and so there's got to be a good reason to order a drink (and these were wonderful!) I had sea bass the first time I ate there, and mahi mahi the second time. The preparation is absolute perfection and the presentation is gorgeous. This is one of the few places where I trust whatever decision the chef has made and don't need to make any substitutions to anything, because I know so much thought has gone into every tiny detail. My co-worker and I have decided to make this a regular drink spot this year-- can't wait!

August 6, 2011|Well-Kept Secret|4|The quality of the food and presentation were top-notch, amazing flavor combinations, the fact that the menu changes daily is a plus, but the menu is almost too limited. I would love to see what the chef could do with other appetizer and entree choices. The ambience is lacking, somewhat spartan; Also the bartender is excellent, a real mixologist, with some really unique cocktails; the wine list is somewhat limited, but the choices available are all very good to excellent. I'm going to really hate it when this place is discovered and i have to wait weeks for a table. This restaurant is a work in progress, a masterpiece in the making.

The tomatoes it was served with were very fresh and flavorful. Someone else had gnocchi, which was very nice and light. We all had cocktails. They were delicious and deceptively strong. Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely return. The service was friendly, knowledgeable and competent. They have a nice bar, but it closes a bit early (10pm on Saturday).

July 17, 2011|Didn't live up to the hype|2|"Not super impressed. Food was mediocre, especially for the price and the service was slow. It was also an odd place to sit. Didn't care for the restaurant in its previous life as ""Oak"" and I can't say I care for Cooke-Brown anymore. Pretty disappointing experience."
July 14, 2011|This is my favorite restaurant|5|This is my favorite restaurant in Providence by far. The food was beautiful, fresh and perfectly cooked. The cocktail I had (blueberry and lemon something- the special of the night) was perfect. Probably my favorite thing about the restaurant is how their menu changes so often to reflect the local produce. The restaurant is also the perfect size- it feels intimate and uncrowded, like you are the only ones there. It has big windows that look over the park, which made us feel like we were outside on a summer night. I can't say enough about this place. It was elegant, comfortable, peaceful and delicious in the most effortless way.
July 14, 2011|Gastropub=good food, sore gluteus|3|As part of Restaurantweeks, I really enjoyed a glass of red with the pork meatballs uniquely combined with rabe and fennel puree, somewhat liked the ricotta gnocchi if only the pesto sauce had more punch (just returned from Italy where garlic pesto is never meant to be this subtle), and the lemon cake with berry creme was perfectly light with a generous cup of robust coffee. While the service was impeccable, I don't really get the gastropub look of the place. . .more like college campus on-a-shoestring feel. Mind you, I usually don't fuss about ambiance if the food is top-notch yet parts of the physical experience distracted me from the great food, namely, very uncomfortable chair that actually squeaked and rocked back with my every mov
July 13, 2011|"The choices on the ""Restaurant"|5|"The choices on the ""Restaurant Week"" menu from which we ordered were, of course, limited; however, the pork meatball appetizer was very nice; the chicken confit entree was perfectly cooked and seasoned; and the dessert(s)--I had a rhubard parfait and my dining companion had a bread pudding--were also tasty and appropriately light. The service was fine; unobtrusive and efficient. I look forward to going back to try the regular menu items (particularly the hamburger, which seemed a favorite.)"

June 29, 2011|True Neighborhood Gem.|4|I dined at Cook and Brown Public House based on the reviews from other Open Table members and it did not disappoint. A small boutique restaurant tucked away in a sweet neighborhood of Providence...almost in Pawtucket, offered a small but varying menu. The drink menu was extensive and fun to read through before choosing. Our waitress was friendly, but not hovering and didn't rush the meal. We sat in the window and watched all the neighborhood walk or run by. Great feeling. There are a few tables outside on the sidewalk if you wish to be outside during the nice weather. This could easily be a neighborhood favorite if you live close by! If you go, be sure to make it to the dessert course! Absolutely my favorite part of the meal!
June 17, 2011|Our party of four had reservations|2|"Our party of four had reservations and came before going to Trinity. One couple got there at 5pm to have a bottle of wine and door was locked, they could see people inside but no one came to door to talk to them. My husband and I arrived at 5:25pm and door was locked. A crabby hostess/manager came over and said ""We don't open till 5:30pm"" and I replied ""So we should come back in 5 minutes?"" She let us in. The rest of the staff was very nice. The other couple who rode around for a half hour joined us (I do not think your open time is on your webpage?). The bread was too hard, the lamb was good but the steak tips were chewy and you receive very litle food for so much $. Pretty place, could be good with some changes."

May 22, 2011|Simply the best...|5|"I travel extensively and love to find great food in each city. Before each trip, I research to determine what the best restaurants are in the local area. After noting Cook & Brown Public House in both the James Beard Nominees and in ""Food and Wine"" Magazine, I knew that I needed to give it a try. I can say, without hesitation, that this was one of the best meals that I've had in several years. The food was absolutely delicious. During this weeklong trip, I traveled to Boston and dined at the best restaurants in that city as well. Again, without hesitation, the food and dining experience at Cook & Brown was so far over any restaurant in Boston as well. Do yourself a favor and try this gem."
May 20, 2011|Cod cakes and asparagus appetizers|4|Cod cakes and asparagus appetizers were good, the main dishes were terrific (bluefish and soft shell crab), and the rice pudding with salted caramel was just fabulous. If we lived nearby we would be regulars, no question.
May 20, 2011|Fabulous. Can't wait to come back.|5|They take their cocktails very seriously here; if you are a cocktail geek you should like this place. The food is great too. I had an Aviation and the lamb ragout over cavtelli. Both were perfect!
May 10, 2011|To be able to go at 9:30,|4|To be able to go at 9:30, particularly with a last minute reservation, was much appreciated.
May 7, 2011|Foodie's Delight|5|Always an interesting menu, perfectly prepared. Knowledgable waitstaff. Finally a great eatery in this out of the way Providence spot.
April 30, 2011|Providence Gem|5|This is a restaurant gem with food inventiveness that tastes wonderful. Everything was perfectly cooked and the flavors subtley worked together to enhance the overall dish. An example of this was the beef tongue appetizer which was to perfection. My monkfish loin entree was also exceptional. The select wine list is smartly chosen to work with the food menu and it appears that the mixed drink menu is creatively done. Service is very good and we liked the slowness from start to finish as it provides time to have conversations with table buddies.....this is not the place to get in and out quickly. The restaurant is smartly done with an interesting weave on the ceiling that helps diffuse the noise level so that it is easy to have a conversion.
April 23, 2011|This place is a gem! Small|5|This place is a gem! Small menu, but all completely fresh and local - delicious! There is also an unusual cocktail list with many liqueurs and spirits I haven't heard of, however our waiter was very helpful in describing the flavors and suggested a few to try. They take the cocktail culture VERY seriously here. We will most certainly be back!
April 21, 2011|I went with my husband and|4|I went with my husband and a friend who was visiting for a job interview. We wanted to take him to a place that would show off the vibrancy of the area and we were not disappointed. We started with the salted cod fritters which were light as a feather and delicious. Our friend had the cauliflower soup which was smooth and rich. The guys had the steak cooked at different temperatures and both said they were cooked perfectly. I had the scallops which were also cooked to just the right temperature. The sauces and sides were prepared with care and meant to be enjoyed as much as the main dish. Let's just say we all used a bit of bread to clean our plates. And our waiter was superb! Only demerit: It was a bit noisy for a deep conversation.
April 21, 2011|Neighborhood Gem|5|What an upscale neighborhood restaurant should be. We are very impressed with the quality of the food and the service. Having a one page menu is a sign of a good restaurant.
April 13, 2011|I have dined here since the|5|I have dined here since the current owners took over. The food is always great and this time was no exception. The celery soup was fantastic. One has to be aware that the menue is limited on purpose by the chief. The wine list is very good and differnt from the typical restaurant. Overall a place to try and I consider a neighborhood gem!
April 8, 2011|Highly recommended to all|5|The staff is very sensitive to special food needs. I have Celiac's and it was the first time in 10 years I have had the pleasure of going out to dinner without having to ask a million questions. The waitress knew what my options were and there were many. The entire staff was beyond professional and my entire party had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food.
April 1, 2011|The food was just amazing|5|The food was just amazing - so simple and fresh and tasty. Also, their gnocchi blew my mind. I've never been a gnocchi fan - always found it gummy and clumpy and usually slathered in oily pesto. This gnocchi was delicious - light and pillowy, like baby scallops or little marshmallows. Simply delicious! Cook and Brown is my new favorite restaurant!
March 30, 2011|Great food, service spotty|4|"The food and drinks are fantastic. Waitstaff were at times very slow. We've dined a bunch of times and I'm not exaggerating when I say that once, after dinner, we ordered coffee and dessert (rice pudding) and the coffee took 15 minutes and we were long done with the coffee before the rice pudding came out. Yes we should have probably complained but it was the end of the meal and we just kept thinking, ""It must be coming now""... Finally it arrived and yes it's the best rice pudding ever, but not worth a 30 minute wait. Other times, we've had no problems with service/speed so maybe it was an off night or it was server specific."
March 20, 2011|A very good restaurant with|3|A very good restaurant with some adventurous menu choices -- I had the Savory Bacon Granola appetizer (which was merely okay but merits an A+ for trying) and there's a reasonably priced and unusual wine list. My Beef Shoulder with Horseradish Sauce was excellent. Yet, somehow I was disappointed. Perhaps it's because Cook and Brown has gotten some stellar press of late and lots of awards and nominations, so I suppose a letdown was inevitable. Still, I wish I lived in the neighborhood; if I did, I would eat there often. It's a relaxed, welcoming, low-key place.
March 20, 2011|Brunch at Cook & Brown|4|Second meal of the weekend. This was brunch. Food was terrific. Coffee was very flavorful but lacking in heat, even after a fresh pour. Combine that with some milk, it was pretty much cold. The only sore spot of the meal. Very laid back vibe, very quiet for brunch. That is in direct opposition to dinner which was very noisy.
March 18, 2011|First meal of weekend visit.|5|First meal of weekend visit. Phenomenal. Sunchoke soup with grapefruit gastrique was a revelation - sweet, smoky, tart, silky. The granola was inspired. Chef Nemo made a nutless version for me so I could taste it as well; my partner had the original with cashews. We split the housemade fettucine with chicken ragu. The noodles were light, eggy, just perfect against the hearty chicken and vegetable mirepoix. My partner had the Hake with chickpeas, red cabbage and pickled veg - that fish was one of the best I've ever had - sweet, prepared with a light hand, crisp from the oven on the exterior. I had the beef shoulder which was wonderful, but the creamed kale was perfection. Rice pudding and salty caramel. No words.
March 18, 2011|The food is always delicious,|3|The food is always delicious, but the local menu can be limiting. Though we were in the mood to linger over drinks at the table, the food took a long time to arrive. Overall, a nice experience.
March 5, 2011|This is the 2nd time I have|3|This is the 2nd time I have been to C&B. It is a very pretty restaurant with nice ambiance, albeit, very dimply lit. There is a small bar with a decent selection of craft brews The wine list, though, needs an overhaul. There is a very limited selection of mostly obscure (read: mediocre) French producers with a few Italian wines thrown in for good measure. The most notable wine on the list is a Louis Latour Puligny-Montrachet, a very uninspiring wine to say the least. The Red Wine list is even worse. Looking at a wine list like this I'm finding it hard to imagine they do much bottles business. But I digress. The food was very good. Better than across the street at Chez Pascal? No. But the very limited menu is well executed. Worth a trip.
March 5, 2011|A very intelligent and inventive|5|A very intelligent and inventive use of seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients.… My hake was a real special dish which was paired with a broth, slaw and mushrooms to generate a wonderfully sophisticated flavor. Staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. We definitely plan a return visit.
March 4, 2011|Falls short of expectations|2|The idea of Cook & Brown is a good one, but it fell short. The food combinations were intriguing, but lacked distinct flavor, which was disappointing. It is an expensive restaurant and we expected a higher level of success with the flavor profiles. While our server was attentive and very good, it took a long time for the maitre'd (or anyone) to appear and address us. We had a reservation and had to wait for at least 7 minutes without any acknowledgement while a loud group took up most of the space and took a long time to settle down at their table. Just a quick word from the bartender to acknowledge us would have gone a long way. If we hadn't had a reservation, we probably would have left without ever tasting anything.
March 3, 2011|the food was wonderful - all|1|the food was wonderful - all main course dishes were served at the same time!!!! our waiter brian continued to check our table to see if we needed anything else - the fron ot house manager checked to see if everything was ok and indeed it was - the rice pudding dessert was to die for - the only problem we had was space for outdoor coats - providence has had a very bad and cold winter so we need space for coats - minor detail we live on east side of providence so it was wonderful having such a great place to go so near to home
February 25, 2011|inventive and delicious food-cockta|5|inventive and delicious food-cocktail and wine by the glass prices a little high
February 25, 2011|Absolutely Delicious !!!!|5|Our first visit to Cook and Brown. Made reservations ONLINE (great!) for an early dinner before a show. Very nice table by the window. Friendly and competent staff. Tables are spaced very nicely! No one is on top of anyone else and it really keeps down the noise level. Also sends a message that the management is not greedy and care more for the customer experience than packing them in. Now the food - I had the braised beef with root vegetables which was incredibly moist and flavorful. My husband had roast chicken, very good as well. The wine list was good. The desserts were incredible. Everything was fresh and a cut above. Other than needing to flag down the waitstaff a few times it was a wonderful experience.
February 23, 2011|Loved, loved, loved it. A|5|Loved, loved, loved it. A bit pricey, but well worth it. We like the idea that the menu changes daily; we will always be surprised by new choices. Great ambience and attention to detail.
February 19, 2011|great burger|5|Very friendly service, interesting and varied menu, and really good burgers.
February 18, 2011|Best restaurant in Providence|5|Best restaurant in Providence so far. Thank god there is good food here!
February 14, 2011|Just drive to Boston.|2|My wife and I dined at C&B for a romantic Valentines Day dinner, maybe that was my mistake. The experience began when my wife and I were told our table would be just a few minutes, so we sat at the bar for a drink and that began the wait which must be part of the C&B experience. The bartender was kind and helpful when he attended to my wife and I but that probably wasn't worth the wait. After a short 10 minute wait we were shown to our seat. It was my first time and I was surprised that they offered 2 options of a set menu. I never expected a 3 course meal would take almost 2 1/2 hours to serve. I almost got up to hunt for the food at one point. The 1st and 2nd course took so long that the dessert options were limited. Overated.
February 13, 2011|The service is very attentive|5|The service is very attentive the food is great and the menu is inventive and ever-changing. Love it every time looking forward to the the next visit.

January 27, 2011|The service was quite slow,|2|The service was quite slow, even though the restaurant was not full. My burger was on the small side, seemed expensive ($13). Bib lettuce salad was good, but also pricey. My husband ordered shrimp cocktail and said that the shrimp were mushy.
January 26, 2011|Take the time to enjoy one|4|Take the time to enjoy one of their homemade cocktails,truly one of the best drinks you will ever have. In a city with a lot of great places to dine Cook and Brown raises the bar on great food done right with local ingredients and a menu that changes to the season.
January 21, 2011|I love this earnest, sophisticated|4|I love this earnest, sophisticated restaurant. Locally sourced ingredients combine with Chef Nemo's talent to make for an interesting, exciting dining experience. Creative cocktails from the boutique bar add to the overall charm, altho it can take a bit too long for drinks to arrive or to be offered. My main gripe is that they started taking reservations at the bar, making it difficult to just drop in a snag a seat at the last minute. It can be frustrating to walk in a see empty bar stools and be told you can't have one.
January 16, 2011|Sometimes conditions are right|5|Sometimes conditions are right for the time..Cook&Brown has opened to a receptive audience who appreciate well prepared food, fresh, local, unpretentious..I will return
January 15, 2011|scallop and flounder dishes|3|scallop and flounder dishes very tasty, but chef is a little heavy handed w/salt. lamb appetizer was a hit w/our son. My lasagna was too dry, and I could not get the servers attention to tell him until the end of the meal. He gave an obligatory sad look and asked if a sauce would have helped it, but there was no follow up at all and it was clear that I hadn't eaten much of it. We did not stay for dessert because the restaurant became very noisy and service was slowing down.
January 14, 2011|The mussels were the best|5|The mussels were the best I've ever had and the homemade rice pudding was as well. Salad greens very fresh and nicely prepared. Wait staff attentive and communicative. Wines were a bit pricey.

The nightly changing menu shows the continued ingenuity in the kitchen. Preparations are simple, but the flavors are fresh and complex. There is no heavy smothering of cream sauce, and no corner cutting.
December 5, 2010|This was our second visit,|4|This was our second visit, not quite as good as our first but still far above average. Loved the squash soup and simple green salad. The John Dory was excellent, but the chicken although good was disappointing -- the crust was too thick and crunchy. Sides were excellent. Dessert was fine, but nothing special.
December 3, 2010|The service was fantastic|3|The service was fantastic -- from the host accommodating us with the table we preferred and finding out the preparation of a dish, to the refilling of water glasses and refolding of napkins when one of us left the table. The food was enjoyable and the atmosphere pleasant. My only complaint is the shortness and quirkiness of the menu. Items were interesting as they stood along, but I had difficulty finding a pleasing progression of dishes.
December 3, 2010|Fabulous. Our favorite place|5|Fabulous. Our favorite place to go right now, as it offers a high quality experience all around, from bar to food to ambience.

November 18, 2010|I've dined at bigger & more|5|I've dined at bigger & more expensive restaurants in the Providence area, but Cook & Brown was the perfect mixture of size style & good food. The service made a lasting impression on me & f.y.i , the mussels were the best i've ever had.
November 13, 2010|Great food, good service,|4|Great food, good service, excellent wine list, and a killer cocktail menu. What more can one ask for?
November 12, 2010|This was our first visit to|4|This was our first visit to C & B Public House. The food was terrific and memorable. Clearly one of the best restaurant meals we have ever had in Providence. We had 6:30PM reservations and the place was packed. There was ample wait staff and our service was prompt, very friendly and professional. Even more impressive, the courses, including the entree were served in a perfect time frame. Something we did not expect due to the large dinner crowd. The only areas that we think need improvement are to train the bar staff in how to make a good Martini. Mine was quite bad. Also, the lighting is harsh and cancels out any ambiance.
November 10, 2010|Excellent dinner. New owner|4|Excellent dinner. New owner has quieted the restaurant and upgraded the food. We will return!
November 6, 2010|We have been to Cook & Brown|4|We have been to Cook & Brown about 7 times and the food is always outstanding! The menu changes frequently and the selections are limited so it is good to check their menu online before you go to make sure it is a night where there will be something you like if you have dietary restrictions or specific tastes. I am always very happy with the menu choices and highly recommend Cook & Brown.
November 6, 2010|Service improved considerably|4|Service improved considerably from our first visit when the server was both inattentive and non-sequential. The food itself is perhaps the best in Providence. Certainly a keeper!
October 30, 2010|Everything we ordered was|5|Everything we ordered was excellent - creative without being too creative. My only complaint is that the cocktails were a bit small for the price ($9-10).
October 24, 2010|C&B presents a unique experience|4|C&B presents a unique experience in Providence. It takes the farm-to-table concept to a completely new level here. The attention paid to every detail and element of flavor is beyond any I have experienced in some time, in any city. The passion and joy of sharing the food truly comes through, from the staff that's willing to go above and beyond to answer questions or share their excitement about a product, to the chef stopping by to converse about what new, exciting things are happening in the kitchen. The bartenders take just as much care. I would highly recommend stopping in a slow night, trying some things and chatting with the staff.
October 23, 2010|Fabulous! Delicious! Great|5|Fabulous! Delicious! Great bar! Visiting our freshman student at Brown, the restaurant is a gem. The bar manager was helpful with wine selection and our cocktails were carefully prepared. Food was terrific, perfectly spiced and satisfying. Will return.
October 21, 2010|Fine food and service -- and|3|Fine food and service -- and that is what we came for! Of secondary importance, but important anyhow: it was noisy and too high energy for us. We had a hard time hearing each other. We liked all the waitstaff people.
October 20, 2010|Excellent new addition to|4|Excellent new addition to the Providence food scene.
October 19, 2010|The restaurant is a re-incarnation|3|The restaurant is a re-incarnation of a space used twice before for restaurants which did not last very long. It was recommended to me by a good friend who knows fine dining. We found the prices higher than expected, so ordered only one drink and an entree. The entree, a swordfish served sliced longitudinally over a combination of onions and fall vegetables, was tender and well-flavored. The restaurant seems to strive for minimalist decor; however we believe it would benefit from some window treatment to obscure an unappealing view and soften the sound.
October 15, 2010|My husband and I were pretty|2|"My husband and I were pretty disappointed. We realize that part of this is that we'd just dined for 8 evenings in Provence where the service and level of food preparation at this level (at least 100.00 per night but not more than 120.00) is simply superb. At your restaurant first, the service was just OK and the piling up of the tableware at the conclusion -- in the waitresses overburdened arms -- was truly not appreciated. She was also not very personable. At eight fifteen, the bluefish fritters were no longer available and this disappointing news was delivered with a non chalant ""so what"" attitude. In comparison to the prof. service one receives in France, one can't help being quite disappointed."
September 26, 2010|Lovely, lovely people, and|4|Lovely, lovely people, and that Brian (waitstaff and wine lover) is fantastic w/his recommendations. Chef does a superb job with natural flavors and herbs. Very, very nice.

When asked, the server wasn't shy about making recommendations, and he was right on target. Both of our meals were spectacular. All the ingredients are in season and very fresh, which really comes through in the flavor. Eclectic and affordable wine list.

Thoughtful cocktail list, delicious food (including some of the most delicate gnocchi I have ever had in a restaurant) and professional, yet friendly, service.

August 14, 2010|I expected the food to be|5|I expected the food to be wonderful and it was. I did not expect to find probably the best cocktails in New England. When you go do not order your usual cocktail but rather one from the inspired bar menu. You will be surprised and pleased the offerings. The food is fresh and carefully crafted to bring the season's best offerings to your mouth. This is a definite repeat dining experience since the menu changes daily.

July 16, 2010|We were underwhelmed by this|2|We were underwhelmed by this place. We knew the menu was limited, so we expected to be wowed by the chef. I mean he/she did not have to prepare a lot of meals.. but come on, a brownie for dessert, tasted like it came out of a package. No TOP chef here. The chicken dish was a bit tough and at the price could have looked better on the plate. The duck/pork balls were Ok, but that is a strange menu choice. And there was nothing else of great interest. Service was slow- we sat at the table ready to order in 5 minutes, I mean with a limited menu what is there to ponder over, and we waited about 15 minutes to place the order. Pricey, and, in my humble opinion, not worth the trip.

July 10, 2010|Loved the location and atmosphere|3|Loved the location and atmosphere here but was sadly disappointed with food...way oversalted barley with the chicken dish affected the whole meal,great burger but strange take on a patty melt with plain sliced rye for the bread (expected grilled), and where are the potatoes for the sirloin tips? The steak was terrific but a potato or some starch was definitely missing. They were sold out of the only pasta special which our diner friend was looking forward to... and the mussels which added to the disappointment. Dessert, however was terrific, the brownie. And drinks were great.

The noise level was workable until about 10:30 when the radio was turned up to a level that made me wonder aloud if they were trying to chase patrons out.
June 5, 2010|Everything about our meal|4|Everything about our meal here was perfect, from the delicious cocktails to the fresh, un-tricky food.

Chef Bolin and his wife have created what I would call the perfect neighborhood restaurant for those who love fresh, local, exciting cuisine. We had baby bluefish slow-poached in olive oil over lentils. The fish had been delivered right off the boat only a half hour before we ordered it. My favorite however (had it both nights) was the ricotta gnocci with a chicken ragu. You have to taste it to believe it! Scott was a very knowledgable server with a passion for the food he was serving. Treat yourself and go. By the way, you will need reservations. It was quite busy on a Thursday night.
