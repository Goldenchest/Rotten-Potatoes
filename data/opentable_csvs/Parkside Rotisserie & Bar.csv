ays ago|Great place -- if you can handle loud noise|4|Food was magnificent. Our server was outstanding. Young man who delivered food not so. But the bar scene was loud and obnoxious and the bartenders seemed to only encourage the bombastic atmosphere. Fun for them. Not for those of us who came to have a nice meal.

February 19, 2016|Very Pleased from host to dessert.|5|We came for a romantic anniversary and asked for a cozy table. We were asked if we would like this table which would have been fine or if we could wait a moment we could have a nicer table. We did and enjoyed a wine at the bar and had a great meal. Thanks.
February 17, 2016|Good food delicious|5|Love the chicken staler. Crab cakes were delicious. Service was great!
February 14, 2016|Always wonderful|5|I am a bit biased here since we had our first date at Parkside, but it is a great restaurant. We always have a wonderful meal. This year we once again went for Valentine's Day the special menu was wonderful and the choices were varied. I also ordered a drink and the waitress asked me what I wanted and she worked with the bartender to make a really really good drink. All in all it was a wonderful evening.
February 14, 2016|Slipping|4|"The food used to be excellent. It is disappointing now. The duck was not bad, but not wonderful. The pork was boring. The creme broulee was really bad. It had t|So urned. We had to send it back. The carrot cake cheesecake was interesting, but not very good. The substitute for the creme broulee was a flourless chocolate cake which was wonderful. The coffee was not very hot. In fact not very warm. Nuts! The service was outstanding. So sad the food is mediocre. We loved this place. Now we have to find another."
February 14, 2016|Loved it!|5|A great place and our go to for a night out! We've been going here for a few years now and never been disappointed. The manager, Adam is a class act as is everyone else who works there from the bartenders to the waitstaff etc...
February 13, 2016|Our favorite restaurant!|5|The food is outstanding! Denis is the best waiter ever!
February 13, 2016|Great Find not your typical Providence  Restaurant|4|First time at Parkside it was Saturday 2/13/16 if you recall this was a - 20F evening. We're so glad we did not wimp out as we had a wonderful time and the Valet was a welcome feature as well!! The restaurant reminds me of a French/Euro eatery with quaint atmosphere which I really like it was bustling at a good noise level. Our meals were excellent my wife had the filet tenderloin and I had the pan seared Salmon both were the best we ever had!! our kick start Martinis were perfect and our wine choices were excellent as well. We split a crepe suzette made with Grand Marnier awesome and a great way to end a perfect evening and meal!
February 13, 2016|Great place for a special night out.|5|Parkside had wonderful food and a very knowledgeable waitress that made great recommendations for our party of 8 (the pork chops were a big hit!) . The hostess was accommodating as we had a few balloons and a cake to bring in for our celebration. We have a large table perfect for our group of 8 in the back of the restaurant. It was fun to be able to see the kitchen from our table. Every meal was delicious and the service wonderful. We did not feel rushed and the waitress took pictures of our group to capture the celebration. We will definitely be back!!
February 12, 2016|One of my favorite restaurants in Provodence|5|Parkside is one of my favorite restaurants on Providence. They have a huge wine list and a great menu. The food is fantastic and the restaurant itself has a great atmosphere. The wait staff is always friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone.
January 30, 2016|Mostly consistent|4|Consistently good food and nice ambiance. Service is usually good, but was not that night. One member of our part is allergic to gluten and the server was not at all knowledgeable about gluten food products.
January 30, 2016|The good, the bad, the ugly|3|Some of our group loved their dinners. My simple grill chicken breast was dry and unexciting. The sides, risotto and asparagus, were good. Our waiter was weird; tried to be funny, but wasn't; forgot to bring dessert menu that we requested. We were a party of six and sat in a banquette, which was comfortable, but the noise level was such that people couldn't hear others speaking.
January 29, 2016|Amazing|5|My husband and i came here for date night and loved it. Reservations were easy, they have free valet, our table was waiting for us when we arrived. We were off to such a great start, then the food came...everything was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. We tried the calamari app, garden salad, short ribs, and seafood stew. Portions were nicely sized (we had leftovers but the app filled us up). It was hard to say no to looking at their dessert menu, but we needed to make a show. Service was great, prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was wonderful. We sat in the back which seemed much quieter than the front.
January 25, 2016|Always wonderful|4|The staff here are very friendly and attentive. The food is consistently good and the value is excellent. You can get in and out in less than an hour if necessary.
January 20, 2016|Delicious food, nice atmosphere|5|Over years, I have tried many dishes and soups at Parkside. Always delicious. Parkside Rotisserie has a variety of seat arrangement. I arrived alone so the server arranged me to a small table with scenery of the park outside - optimal for me especially considering that I have no company. There are tables for bigger groups of people, and the bar.
January 9, 2016|Parkside Rotisserie & Bar, so good!|4|My dining experience at Parkside was overall very good. A friend works here as a server and couldn't rave enough about the food, service and ambiance. I agree, my boyfriend had the special (bacon wrapped filet) and I tried the lemon cashew dish. Both amazing. I didn't grab our servers name but she was very attentive and prompt with our meal and drink orders. We sat in a cozy two top towards the middle of the dining area at 7:15 on a Saturday and based on word of mouth I wasn't surprised when I saw that every table was filled. My only minor issue was that we were seated next to a table of four who were a bit loud with their conversation, with one gentleman in particular continuing to stare in our direction for long periods of time which was uncomfortable and distracting. I understand the close proximity of table seating and maximizing the number of guests you can accommodate, but it affected my experience and I thought it should be noted. Perhaps next time we'll try sitting at the bar.
January 9, 2016|I could live here.|5|"There was no area in which Parkside didn't shine, so I'm not sure whether to start with the amazing food, warm atmosphere, or our charming waitress. I think I'll start with the waitress. Every waiter was busy that night, yet our waitress noticed that we needed more lemon for our shrimp. Then she noticed that my girlfriend (on a January detox) was soon going to need more club soda with pineapple juice. We really didn't need to ask for anything. My GF turned to me after she left, squeezed my arm, and said, ""I love her"". Our waitress (Erin) also of course noted when I was finishing with my champagne, and then wine, etc... as I was very much *not* on a January detox. Anyway, the food was delicious, PLENTIFUL, and seasoned exquisitely. I'm serious, I haven't noted such a pleasing overall flavor profile in quite some time. I am so impressed. We were giddy after we left this place. Will return early and often."
January 9, 2016|An evening to remember|5|Took friends as a late Christmas gift and had a great time. The martinis were fantastic and filled the large glasses. For an appetizer we tried the two different varieties of oysters offered that evening -- both were delicious and these may have been the best oysters I've ever had. We all loved our meals. My wife tried the crispy salmon, and I had the pork mignon. The pork could be ordered as an artisan dish that came with a sauce and specific sides or just as a grilled selection with a choice of sides. I tried the grilled version and had roasted brussels sprouts with lardons and truffle risotto as my sides. All was fantastic. Our guests had the roasted chicken and the braised shortribs and both raved about their meals. Desserts included the flourless chocolate truffle cake that was presented like a sculpture, and some type of apple concoction. All in all, a great place and a great evening. The server was sweet and polite, and attentive without making us feel rushed. We will definitely go back and highly recommend this place!
January 7, 2016|Specials were great|5|We tried a few specials and they were fabulous. The cod over risotto was wonderful and the pasta and chicken special was delicious too.

January 2, 2016|Over the top experience|5|We had not been to Parkside in many years, but always loved it. This recent visit exceeded all expectations from fulfilling special order appetizer to ambiance to service to absolutely yummy meals. Could not have been more pleased!! Denis completely exceeded our expectations.
December 31, 2015|Top Notch!|5|Had dinner New Year's Eve. Rack of lamb special was plentiful and terrific. Others in my party had the filet mignon, likewise superb. Drinks were excellent full pours! Service was outstanding. We've been long time fans of the Parkside...it's why we keep coming back. Highly recommend!

Special entrees of hangar steaks cooked to perfection and raved about by both diners. Wait staff very attentive with perfect timing so we never felt rushed. One of our favorite restaurants in Providence. Thank you for an enjoyable evening.
November 28, 2015|Consistently good|4|We love to bring guests to the Parkside because their menu has something for everyone. We shared the dumplings as an appetizer, which never disappoint. Double cut pork chop & simply grilled salmon dishes were both cooked perfectly. Another great night of dining. Valet parking is also a plus in this neighborhood.

November 14, 2015|Great Service, Good Food but noisy|4|Parkside is one of my favorite restaurants but anyone considering going there for the first time needs to know that it can be very loud. The bar is embedded in the front dining area, the ceilings are somewhat low and the floors are hardwood which can make the noise level high. Also, the tables are somewhat close together which adds to the noise level. The food is generally good to very good and the service has always been excellent.

November 12, 2015|Consistently Great|5|This restaurant is a favorite lunch spot for me and my coworkers. The workers are very attentive and friendly and the food is always fabulous.
November 3, 2015|Quality Dining By The Court House|4|The Parkside provides quality food and excellent service right by the Court House and across from a lovely park. The luncheon menu has an array of sandwiches, special salads, and items that meet a variety of palates. Service is attentive and meals are delivered in a timely manner. Everything at the Parkside feels crisp and smart. I have eaten here several times and am never disappointed with the quality of the food, the service, and the ability to have a great conversation without interruption.

One improvemenr needed was waitress attitude. She forgot who the customer was and got annoyed by questions. Definitely eat here , though!
October 24, 2015|Nice Spot|4|We have been here many times before, this time the food was excellent as was the service. It was freezing at our table and they took care of it right away. We were a group of 5 and the noise level in the restaurant was high, so conversation across the table was somewhat difficult. We will be back for sure - food was really good.
October 24, 2015|Among the best!|5|Excellent food at a fair value and always consistent! The octopus appetizer is the best on the Providence restaurant scene. The simple grill is always excellent and varied. We had the flat iron steak and salmon with the choice of several excellent sides. Highly recommend...you won't be disappointed!
October 17, 2015|Great!|4|"We were a party of 6 on a Sat. evening. Restaurant was hopping but the service was perfect and the waitstaff were cheerful and attentive. One of us had the Moules en Frites and he loved the mussels but the ""smoked tomato butter"" was a bit thick and overwhelmed the mussels a bit. Very tasty but strong flavored. Another had the foie gras - delicious!! Main courses - steak frites (was undercooked - our party asked for med (pink) and it came rare (red) but still tasty), beef short ribs (perfect! Delicious!), crispy salmon (excellent lentils!), and the special lamb shank (OMG - really excellent!). Overall, definitely worth a visit!"

When he thought we were in need, he checked in. Kept things moving along nicely. Crabcakes were good, the salsa with them was very flavorful. Lemon chicken was fine but in the dry side.

We had to wait about 30 minutes before he returned to clear our finished meal and take care of the bill. We also had to sip our drinks slowly as he was not prompt on the refills. That's what you get when your server hangs out in the back of the restaurant.
Dined on October 7, 2015|Lunch time meeting|4|Had lunch hear and decided to get the Tenderloin and Portobello Mushroom Salad, it was a great size and tasted great, the other members in our party also enjoyed there lunch as well. This restaurant was very clean and great service. I would go back again for sure.

September 26, 2015|Great night out|5|My wife and I go out a few times a week but it was our first visit to the Parkside. We both said it was one of the best meals we have had all year. It was a little loud and the tables are small but the food was great.
September 17, 2015|Birthday Celebration|5|My friend and I who share birthdays, went for lunch to celebrate. The food was delicious. The tenderloin salad was amazing and done to perfection. My friend had the chicken and said it was just what she needed. At the end of the meal, they surprised us with an amazing chocolate torte decorated beautifully. The torte was decadent.
September 12, 2015|A great stop before Waterfire|4|We made a reservation at Parkside as we were attending Waterfire in Providence that evening. We lucked out and were able to score an outside table on a nice night. An added bonus is we had one of the few outside tables whose view is not immediately blocked by parked valeted vehicles. The charcuterie and cheese plate was delicious, as were the spicy creamed corn and truffle parmesan risotto. The bartender made a good Old Fashioned and the Fume Blanc by the glass on hand was tasty. The real winners of the night were the Peking duck and pork mignot (yes pork, you read that correctly) entrées and both were happily devoured. The dessert menu was kind of uninspiring after seeing the dinner menu, but that's forgivable. Inside the restaurant was very loud even by my standards which takes a lot. If anyone in your party who is hard of hearing you may want to sit outside or ask for a table along a wall. We'll certainly keep this place in mind for a return trip!
September 12, 2015|Great experience|4|We brought a small group of friends(party of 6) to Providence for a Waterfire event. The location was perfect, the staff attentive and the food fantastic. Our group was diverse in palate, the menu accommodated everyone. I would recommend the Steak Frites. If scallops are offered, you will not be disappointed. The Charcuterie and Cheese platter was the perfect size of yummy goodness. The Roast Duck Salad was large and delicious. A return trip is a must.
August 29, 2015|Always a great meal|5|My wife and have been to Parkside several times. Staff is always great and the food is best we have had in Providence. We have a tried a few other restaurants, but always return to Parkside.
August 29, 2015|great restaraunt|5|wife and I had dinner Saturday evening just before the waterfire event on the canal. We each had a different special, both were most delightful, and for what it was, not overpriced. The waiters were attentive but not intrusive, and the location is very handy.

August 1, 2015|Love the Parkside!|5|We were there this past busy Waterfire night. Service was great...food was great (Salmon & Flat Iron Chimichurri Simple Grills)...drinks were perfect and fully poured. I continue to maintain that all things considered (quality, value, ambiance, etc. etc.) Parkside is near the top among the many very good restaurants in Providence. Not the best in any single category...but the best all round!

Right next to where Waterfire is held. We had dinner and then walked across the street for the fire lighting. Would recommend this place with or without Waterfire.
August 1, 2015|Okay food, poor service|3|I am not one who usually has negative things to say about a place, but my experience here was less than stellar. The waiter was not very attentive and forget something we had asked for 3 times before we gave up asking in addition to being uncaring to our experience. The food was okay, nothing special, and the duck I had was tough to eat and cut (with the only knife I had, the butter knife) so I was dissatisfied with my meal overall.
July 25, 2015|Fabulous|5|Food great, service wonderful what more can I say. This place never fails to please.
July 24, 2015|Deeeeelish!|5|This was our second time here and loved the food both times. Our second time was a bit more enjoyable to the friendly and ver accommodating waitress. That made a huge difference. Everything was delicious from our appetizers, dinners and drinks to the unbelievable salted caramel lava cake. Sooooooo good!!

Their calamari is excellent, the salads fresh, and the entrees relatively creative. The staff are pleasant but know how to not intrude. Always a good choice. A bit ""pricey"" as a previous review stated, but it's that kind of restaurant."
July 10, 2015|Happy to be back|5|Have not been to Parkside for a couple of years now, Always remember it as a good, pleasant place to be with great food. Was not disappointed with this latest return and I promise not to stay away for so long.

My friend had the simple cod with asparagus and Mac and cheese. We both cleared our plates. Sat at the bar, bartenders Dave and another who's name we missed, were attentive, conversational and accommodating. Bar had plenty of room when we arrived at 630 and the place was bustling by the time we left at 930pm. I brought some flourless chocolate torte home for my husband and he loved it!
June 26, 2015|Providence Trip|4|Having been born Providence I always enjoy going back and the downtown east side are is my favorite. Food was very good but a little pricey, ambiance was nice, enjoyed our dinner
June 19, 2015|Delicious rotisserie chicken|5|My favorite dish is the spicy lemon cashew chicken.
June 19, 2015|Delicious|5|This restaurant remains one of my favorite. I never have had a bad meal or service here. It is easy to have lunch within an hour if you are time constrained. The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable.
June 13, 2015|PRICEY|4|We were a group of 4 going to ppac...so our reservations were at 6pm. We split two salads and two entrees..the beef special was very good....however when the price of the special is more expensive than any entree on the menu...you should be advised....

May 10, 2015|Nice Place|4|I went to Parkside for Mother's Day with my mother. Surprisingly, it was not at all crowded in the middle of the afternoon and we sat at the window. The view was very nice. Our tastes vary drastically, I like my food spicy and flavorful. She likes and/or needs her food to be more bland. We started with sharing the grilled baby octopus (about 6) which came with Serrano ham, grilled olives and a red onion and fennel salad. It was very good until I saw the Calamari appetizer being served to the table next to us that came in a little later. A better choice. I really liked the Parkside Salad - a nice appetizer-sized salad that was flavorful and satisfying without being filling. My mother chose the Halibut special and ate every bit and enjoyed it immensely. I chose the Basque Shellfish Stew instead of the Lamb special. Maybe the wrong choice, I don't know since I didn't see or taste the Lamb. The stew was OK but the paprika tomato broth was bland and needed more zest to make it pop. Unfortunately for Emma, our server, we don't require a lot of attention and don't request much so she didn't get to show how good she really could have been but for what we needed she was great. My ratings are based upon my mother's reaction to the food (she ate everything and loved it ) and my so-so attitude towards the food (good but not outstanding). One thing that I did like - they have complimentary valet parking! Parking can be difficult on South Main St.
May 10, 2015|Enjoyable Mother's Day Lunch|4|"I am never disappointed at Parkside. Food and service are always very good. Mother's Day was their normal dinner menu, with several additions. I would have appreciated at least one ""breakfasty"" special, but that's a minor point. Love the creative cocktails. Fifty Shades and Can-Can were excellent. Cashew Chicken was a little messy, but very good. Tasty lemon brined rotisserie chicken covered in a tasty ginger/tamari/cashew glaze. Rack of lamb was cooked perfectly. Banana tart lived up to the hype and was worth the 20 minute wait for it to be made to order."
May 9, 2015|Still the best!|5|I've written numerous rave reviews of the Parkside. Great food, great drinks. Simple grill options are the best value (and quality) of any high end restaurant in Providence. Just go...
April 25, 2015|Always a treat and a delight!|5|Always a fantastic evening. Parkside is warm and cluby. Food is always delish and inventive. We love to sit by the kitchen and share the energy. And with the exception of the big steaks the rest of the menu is surprisingly affordable. Every aspect of the food and dining end was fantastic. Only issues were that our area was grossly under-lit and way to noisy. There is romantically dim and then there is dark. This was dark! The sound issues do not stem from the noise level. It stems from the lack of inventive sound absorption. not a drop in the place.
April 17, 2015|Always a treat!|5|My wife and I come here on Fridays, a time we have set aside for each other. At the end of the week, we are typically tired and want most of all, to be treated attentively but not intrusively. We also want a menu that has trustworthy favorites punctuated by enticing specials. The Parkside provides all of this--we try to sit in the back, which is quieter, and watch the activity around rotisserie. We like the pacing of the service, which is not rushed but never awkwardly slow, either. The food is very flavorful, delivering rich tastes and presented in visually interesting configurations.
April 15, 2015|Great Place for Lunch|4|The service was fabulous, our waiter was very attentive and the food was very good. Great place to have a nice lunch if you are on a time limit.
April 11, 2015|Birthday dinner|4|We went to Parkside for a special occasion. We were seated in the back area at a small table. The food choices were good. You can get special dishes as well as plain grilled meats and side choices. The service was good until several large parties were seated nearby and taken care of by the same waiter. He did his best to take care of everyone though. Desserts were outstanding! Try the berry tart or key lime cheesecake. They decorated a Happy Birthday plate for dessert with chocolate writing. Nice touch! One drawback is that the restaurant does get smoky from the open kitchen.

March 29, 2015|Great food, relaxing ambiance. Love their ochef!|4|Celebrated birthday dinner with family--great food, service and ambiance. Duck, pork and seafood entrees cooked to perfection, beautifully presented. Drinks are generous and their special to the house cocktails were exquisite. No place better for an evening of eat, drink and be merry!
March 27, 2015|DINNER FOR TWO|4|TH E MANAGER IS VERY ACCESSIBLE AND THE FOOD IS USUALLY VERY GOOD AND FRESH. THE OWNER COMES IN OFTEN AND IS VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY, ALSO. IT'S A NICE PLACE WITH A LIVELY BAR. .
March 21, 2015|Consistently Excellent!|5|I'm a long time customer. Parkside is consistently excellent...food, drinks, service, staff...it's all good! The octopus appetizer is the best in town, by far. The simple grills are great, and a good value to boot. The drinks are poured full, and the bartenders know what they're doing. I highly recommend!
March 17, 2015|Crispy salmon served over lentils very p...|4|Crispy salmon served over lentils very pleasing to the palate. Could be my new favorite dish at Parkside. Portion generous enough to take some home for another lunch! Lemon garlic chicken not too exciting but hopefully heart healthy!
March 6, 2015|Fresh food, large portions, lively place|4|We had dinner at Parkside on a busy Friday night. I had a Parkside Salad as an appetizer (there are two sizes; I think the small is plenty), and it was fresh and tasty. My companion started with the spicy crab cakes. They were crispy and delicate with a nice sauce. For an entrée I had a NY Strip steak. It came sliced; it was slightly underdone in the middle, but it was well-seasoned and a good size. I had the spicy creamed corn on the side – not to my liking, but some might enjoy the Tex-Mex flavors. Plus impossibly thin pommes frites, which were crispy and salty. You must get those! My companion had the Pork Rack from the rotisserie menu. Wow, that was a treat. It was huge – something that I would cook as a roast at home for two or three people – but perfectly cooked. We brought leftovers home from both entrees and got more meals out of them. One of us happened to mention to the host that it was my birthday. Somehow word got to our server, who gave us a complimentary slice of flourless chocolate cake. Classy! We were there at peak time, so it was occasionally tough to get our server’s attention, but he was friendly and helpful. The energetic valet parking attendant was quick and friendly. It's very convenient to have this service, which is free (except for the tip, of course).
March 6, 2015|Among the best!|5|Parkside is among the best restaurants in Providence. The octopus appetizer is wonderful, the simple grills are a bargain given the quality of the food and the presentation. As a long time fan, Parkside never disappoints! Go!
February 28, 2015|Table was ready early....|4|Although parking is not simple, I was pleasantly surprised to find that our table was reserved and ready for us 10mins. early. The hostess was very sweet and our waiter was great. Calamari was awesome and I had the roast duck salad, delish! I was surprised that we had a ton of food for a reasonable price. I would go there again :).
February 26, 2015|Fine dining at Parkside|4|Lovely menu and gorgeous presentation of food, Parkside delivers on every level.
February 21, 2015|What happened to Parkside?|2|I used to love this restaurant. Went many times for both lunch and dinner. This time was such a disappointment. Start with service. The waitress was obviously new. We could hardly get her to take our drinks, She left before the 4th person at the table even got a chance to order his. She kept on disappearing. Oh well, that might have been OK if the food was something to rave about. A chicken dish with ginger and some brown sauce was so over sauced that everything, including the French fries were covered in goop making the fries soggy and the chicken drowned. Two people ordered it, two people did not like it. The pasta dish was also over sauced with a heavy hand. We decided to forgo dessert. Really surprised about the food (and it is somewhat pricey..Boston chicken is better). Won't be back for a long time. The valet parking guys were very nice!!!
Dined on February 13, 2015|Excellent dining experience.  Service was perfect.|5|My husband and I enjoyed the meal very much. There were plenty of choices and the food was prepared to perfection. I would definitely return and/or recommend to a friend.
February 6, 2015|good meal, not great|4|"Have been to Parkside 4 times before, each time was a ""great"" on the scale. This time however was only ""good"". The parpardelle duck pasta (normally one of the best dishes) was dry and lukewarm, the waiter had to look at the menu multiple times when asked questions, no wine pairings were suggested when specifically asked (yes, I'll drink what I like, but when I ask you for a suggestion, make one!). Calimari was great app, and we'll be back, just hope this was an anomaly"
January 30, 2015|Always Delicious|5|We were a party of 8 people celebrating a birthday for my boss. The server was attentive and prompt. We all ordered different dishes and the food was delicious and served promptly. They presented a lovely dessert to my boss for his birthday which was very nice.

January 17, 2015|Great food and reasonable prices|5|I forgot my I phone on the table and I must say honest staff and bus boys. They held it for me in the office overnight till I came for it. It feels good to go to a great place with great staff.
January 17, 2015|Went for Resturant Week|4|My food was exceptional, I had the short braised ribs and scallops for an app. I would not recommend going there for restaurant week, Sienna's was much more bang for the buck. The portions were so small, we were joking if we should go to Wendy's or Burger King after. You only got one scallop for the app and a half a grapefruit size of short ribs. I let 2 people try it and I was sorry I did because it was soooo small. I wasn't crazy about the flourless choco cake. Needless to say we had a great time and the service was excellent too! I would go back, but not for Restaurant week.
January 16, 2015|Always good|5|We have been to the parkside many times before and we are never disappointed. We were most recently there for restaurant week and I was very pleased with the variety offered in the pre-fix menu. Half of our group ordered the pre-fix menu and the other 1/2 ordered from the regular menu and everyone was very pleased.
December 31, 2014|Cold! Don't sit near the door.|3|We were seated in the front window which is cold and got colder every time the doors opened. On New Years eve, the host's stand was just inside the door. Groups held the doors open while the first person spoke to the host. It was Cold. Don't sit near the door. The food was good.
December 30, 2014|great lunch spot after visiting RISD.  .|5|Chef willing to shuck oysters for granddaughter. Fries outstanding.

December 17, 2014|Great lunch!|5|Surprisingly busy for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. Glad I made a reservation! Delicious lunch. Well priced. Outstanding Cubano sandwich with homemade fries!
December 14, 2014|Consistently excellent.|4|This is one our favorite restaurants. Food is always excellent, the atmosphere is quiet with appropriate soft dining music in the background. Wine list is large enough to meet almost everyone's taste. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who values food preparation and presentation, quiet atmosphere and excellent service. If light snow is falling, be sure to get one of the window tables, The view of the park across the street is magical.
December 8, 2014|Food is always awesome.  Who would have ...|5|Food is always awesome. Who would have thought that a double cut pork chop could be accompanied by a clam and mussel combo and topped with a tomato based salsa? Great blend of flavors...too bad it was just a special of the evening. Pork mignon also delicious as was the pasta bake. Rapidly becoming one of our favorite dining spots in Providence!
December 6, 2014|The food was amazing|5|My daughter and I went here for dinner before attending a show at PPAC I liked the convenience of the Valet service when you pull up out front; as the night we went it was raining The restaurant is small, but elegantly decorated and cozy For such a small place and the fact that it was full, the noise level was minimum, The food was Amazing I would definitely recommend this restautant
December 4, 2014|Consistently Excellent|5|The restaurant is beautiful, food is fabulous and the value is amazing. Can't wait to go again soon.
November 29, 2014|Service with a smile|5|I can't say enough good things about our evening at Parkside. Due to a family issue we had to call earlier in the day to see if it would be possible to change our 7p reservation to 7:30p. We knew it was asking alot on a Saturday, but even more so on Thanksgiving weekend, and figured that we would most likely lose our reservation. But, to our amazement the restaurant not only accommodated our request to change - they even accommodated our original request, at the time of booking, for a quiet side table!! Now, that's service with a smile. The food was fabulous. Starting off with the dumpling appetizer (incredibly good) then entrees: double porkchop, crispy salmon and salmon special. All of these dishes were perfectly prepared and portions were more than enough. Our server was pleasant and informative. She had impeccable timing. The whole evening was a win. We will definitely be back.
November 28, 2014|Always Excellent!|5|Service and food excellent as usual. Our favorite for simple dinner to special occasions.
November 24, 2014|Parkside is my favorite Providence restaurant|5|The food is incredible. The wine list is very good. They always have delicious specials.
November 22, 2014|Our first visit for dinner did not disap...|4|Our first visit for dinner did not disappoint. Pork mignon cooked perfectly as ordered (med) and nice melding of flavors with the apple butter topping and accompaniments of maple glazed sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Coq au vin also nicely presented and very tasty. Already know what I'm ordering on our next visit - the baked pasta dish. Come hungry as portions are abundant.
November 22, 2014|My husband and I went to Parkside with a...|5|My husband and I went to Parkside with another couple. We were seated promptly, and out waiter Danise, not sure of the spelling, was fantastic! Their menu is very different without being intimidating. The only drawback is when you site at the tables by the bar, it's a little cramped, especially if you have a Coat and or purse. We will definitely go back!
November 21, 2014|Always good|5|Been here several times, never a bad meal, service always good
November 20, 2014|Great business lunch|4|I had two associates in from out of town. The location near the park, the river, Brown and RISD provides a welcomed view of old Providence. The interior is comfortable and warm. The lunch menu is diverse with options for all. I had the rotisserie 1/2 chicken and it was excellent. The staff was welcoming and very efficient.
November 15, 2014|Leftovers ???|4|"My low star rating for the service is not because of the service our waitress gave us- she was very good-BUT- she forgot to wrap my dinner to go and threw it out with a simple, ""sorry""...I had the pork tenderloin special of the night and purposely had only finished half expecting to save for later, very disappointing! But to still be positive, we always enjoy the Parkside."
November 14, 2014|Excellent food and ambiance|5|Parkside has been one of my local favorites over the years, and food has always been good. This was first time I'd been back since menu was modified (some time ago), and the food was truly outstanding. Everything from the shrimp cocktail to rotisserie special to a pasta dish were top both. Portions are generous. Bar is terrific. All around, this is on my top 3 in PVD!
November 8, 2014|Why didn't I didn't try it sooner?|5|Dined all over the City & have passed Parkside many times. Gave it a try on a WaterFire night & LOVED IT! Great location across from Memorial Park events. Arrived early for drinks @ bar. Great cocktail selection & a few craft beers on tap. Seated on time & waitstaff knew the menu well. Shared 4 apps (Colossal Thai Dumplings, Grilled Baby Octopus, Risotto of the Day, and Charcuterie and Cheese). All prepared and presented excellently. Octopus could have been a bit more tender, but the rest were delicious. 3 had Blackened Sirloin with Bourbon Molasses Sauce and Charred Corn Salsa. Meat was cooked perfectly w/ nice presentation. Striped Bass over White Beans was delicious. Banana tart was fabulous! Flourless chocolate cake was very rich.
November 1, 2014|Very noisy|2|Even in the far rear, away from the bar, conversation was difficult. Food was good. Service was fair. Value was good. Best for a loud night out. Not good for an intimate meal.
November 1, 2014|Perfectly Parkside|4|Every dish in the large menu that we had was made to perfection. Chef's decisions of accompaniment to the protein were smart and flavorful. Portions were bigger-than-average. Prices were moderate. Room was a tad noisy, but some like that. Service was first rate. Lots of choices; big menu! Varied wine list, many price levels. Our first visit to this downtown Providence joint; a pleasant surprise. Highlights: Steak Tartar app was seasoned especially well & served creatively with hand-cut waffle fries. The Peking Duck was a stretch from the real thing but tasty! Maybe a little too much work as it is DIY. All in all: Worthy to return.
November 1, 2014|Dinner at Parkside Rotsseire|4|Love sitting at the window seats, romantic and very comfortable. Reasonably priced meals and good service
October 31, 2014|Great Start to a Nice Night|4|Went with a couple of family members to the PR & B for dinner before attending a sporting event in Providence. I totally enjoyed it. The food, drinks, service and ambience were all very positive which made for a very enjoyable meal. While there wasn't a big selection of raw seafood the quality of the oysters were very good. We found the mixed drink menu to be fun and the selection of beers to be worthy of a good city restaurant. Our main courses were all delicious. I had a risotto and chicken special that was wonderful, prepared perfectly. Other members of our party had rotisserie chicken and burgers and thought they were very satisfying. The prices were very reasonable
October 26, 2014|food was delicious|4|My daughter and I had a very tasty dinner there, both having short ribs, which were braised perfectly. Had a reasonablely priced bottle of wine which complemented the meal nicely. Banana tart and creme brulee for dessert were divine. If I lived in the area I would go back and try different entrees. It was a nice dining experience in a cozy, warm atmosphere. Only problem was not having dessert menu after asking and having bill put on table when dessert was delivered. We had a bill that was a good amount and felt rushed at the end. By the way restaurant was not packed that night.
October 26, 2014|We had a wonderful experience at Parksid...|4|We had a wonderful experience at Parksider Rotisserie. We called to change our reservation time and were gladly accommodated. Then when we arrived 20 minutes early, we were seated immediately. The waiter was knowledgable and friendly. He was attentive without being intrusive. We're from California and were only in the area for a few days, so picked this restaurant based solely on customer reviews. The food was fantastic. Glad we found this place. We will definitely be back.
October 25, 2014|Lew|5|Took my son and several college friends for dinner. Food was terrific and creative. The rotisserie dishes in particular were very good. The atmosphere was vibrant, but not too loud that we could converse. Very convenient for RISD and Brown parents.
October 25, 2014|Great food, service and location|5|Enjoyed a wonderful dinner with our son during Family Weekend at Brown. Perfect location for a walk down the hill and then stroll by the river. My son enjoyed their gnocchi special and I thought the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with butternut squash and brussel sprouts was outstanding. Great service by everyone at the restaurant. Reasonable prices for great tasting food with IMO large entree portions.
October 23, 2014|Second Time Around|3|My first visit was not very good. This time, for lunch, I found the entire experience much improved.
October 21, 2014|Great Find|5|Great atmosphere, quick & friendly service at the bar.Amazing appetizers fresh oysters, spicy crab cakes & calamari. Equally amazing nightly specials of sword fish,pork roast, & pasta. Service was timely & friendly. Every dish went back to the kitchen empty! Topped off double espressos & crepes. We will most certainly return soon to try more of there dishes. We give it a outstanding recommendation.
October 18, 2014|birthday girl|4|For of us went to celebrate my birthday. The steak tartrate was outstanding as was the lamb shank. The swordfish special was so salty we had to send it back. Our server was wonderful and took it back and offered something else. My friend asked for a roasted chicken and it was brought out in a few minutes. The dessert I ordered came out with happy birthday written in chocolate over a pool of mango sauce. Pretty and delicious!
October 18, 2014|Excellent as always!|5|Martinis were great and fully poured. We had octopus appetizers, salmon simple grill and steak simple grill. Food was plentiful and superbly prepared. You won't leave hungry. We come here often and recommend to everyone...
October 18, 2014|Delicious dinner|4|Had dinner here Sat with my husband and daughter who had just moved back to the area after 10 years in Boston We knew it would be a lovely dinner and she was impressed. Great food, excellent service, tasteful decor. We had Peking Duck and Coq au vin very tasty. Great specialty cocktails.
October 17, 2014|Pleasantly surprised|5|"I made this reservation last minute with my daughter and was amazed at the quickness we got our table. Our waiter was absent for a good majority of the night and I didn't mind this because I really hate waiters that ""hover"". He was there when we needed him. The only downside of the entire evening was the man next to us was talking loud enough one would think he was running for office. But other than that, excellent food, wine, service and my daughter absolutely loved the menu and she's a real fussy eater!"
October 15, 2014|Pleasantly surprised…|4|I wasn't exactly sure what kind of restaurant it would be from the name. I brought a group of 20 people from my company for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised with the food. The menu was extensive and the food was great, as was the wine. Service was good too. Recommended.
Dined on October 15, 2014|Our service was outstanding - I was late...|5|Our service was outstanding - I was late joining my group and actually ordered my drink with the waiter over the phone. As I walked up to my table I was handed an icy martini! We dined before a show at PPAC and had their Pre fixe menu - the chicken was delicious. Great experience!
October 12, 2014|Parkside Rotisserie|5|The food was GREAT, I would highly recommend anyone to try it out.
October 12, 2014|Short visit to Providence.|4|Food delicious, ambience perfect for us. Service good.
October 11, 2014|Watefire Gem|4|Five of us dined here prior to strolling over to Providence Waterfire on October 11. We were seated promptly and our server was knowledgeable and very friendly. The drinks and food were delicious, and the proximity to the the festivities made it an excellent choice for us.
October 11, 2014|Superb Service Extra Mile|5|My wife and I took our cousins for their birthdays and the four of us enjoyed it tremendously. Not having been here in sevrral years I requested their old mushroom burschetta appetizer that I always loved and they whipped it right up. Thanks for going the extra mile.
October 10, 2014|Food was great!!|5|I get the filet and it was full of flavor and the sides were yummy. I went with 4 other people who were also very satisfied with their meals!
October 3, 2014|huge menu for fine dining|5|I have found that in general, many top restaurants get away with a very small menu, which can be hard when going out with a group or even just one finicky eater. Well, PR & B has a delightfully large menu and there is plenty for everyone. Even pure vegetarians will not feel left out, as just the app and side menu is big enough to satisfy. Being a carnivore, I was extremely pleased and sampled chicken, steak and fish at my table. The steak tartare was delicious. The cod with shrimp grits was one of best dinners I have ever eaten. Giant thai dumplings were great. We did not try dessert as we were quite full after the apps and mains. Prices were reasonable. There was valet parking, but street pkg is possible in the area.
September 30, 2014|Birthday dinner|4|My husband and I ate here on a Tuesday night for my birthday. The place is vibrant and clean. The server was very knowledgable. We started with the dumplings, which were phenomenal. We both ordered a chicken dish from the rotisserie, it was good but took a very long time. The desserts, however, arrived quickly and were amazing! My husband had the creme brulee and I had the chocolate lava cake. This was one of the best desserts I have ever had. We will definately be returning to the Parkside.
September 28, 2014|Serendipity|5|On a day trip from Boston, discovered Parkside on O/T and it was a delightful find. Food was well-prepared, inventive and first-rate. Service was a tad rough, but server was attentive and his recommendations spot-on. Unlike an increasing number of restaurants, the noise level was moderate and permitted easy conversation. Will look forward to a return visit.
September 27, 2014|Waterfire Night|5|The additional tables outside expanded the normally loud restaurant to the street. Very convenient for a great meal and then a stroll along Waterfire.
September 13, 2014|Excellent for a large party|5|We had 10 people in our party. We sat in the back room, which was full of other diners although we were away from the bar area. The service was excellent. We were moving slowly and the waitress was very attentive bringing us drinks and apps without pushing us. We received a few good recommendations for wine and food orders. 1 guage of a restaurant is the bread and it was excellent. The food was excellent - all hot, several different dishes, apps and main course, and all excellent. I ate the peking duck and it is served the way they prepare it in Bejing with the moo shu pancakes, hoisin sauce and vegetables. The halibut was a nice thick piece cooked to retain the moisture. Several people brought leftovers home. We will be back.

September 6, 2014|Another great meal...|5|Had the octopus appetizer...best appetizer on Providence restaurant scene. Also had the steak simple grill. Terrific meal and a very fair value. Highly recommend you go!
August 23, 2014|Dissatisfied on this evening|2|Based on this evening only.. A busy Waterfire night, our waiter was not personable nor consistent in his service to us. Spoke fast and did not make much eye contact not ever even giving us his name. Our meals and appetizer were over cooked .. After speaking w manager to give our feedback he was sincerely apologetic and said the policy was to remove cost of meals even though we explained to him this was not our intention. We have eaten here prior to this night and enjoyed our meals. We may try again down the road.
August 23, 2014|Delicious Food and Drinks|4|We came here for my husband's birthday dinner out. We were looking for a spot close to Waterfire so we could see it after we ate. We were seated right away. The restaurant is cute and relaxed. Our server was very attentive and was able to promptly answer our questions about cocktails and the food. Appetizers were great - crab cakes were exceptional and loaded with crab and the dumblings were just as good. My husband ordered the pork minon which was amazing. I had a simple grilled steak that was cooked perfectly. It was noisy but we chalked it up to the large crowd and Waterfire - we could still have good conversation. Overall a great night out!!
August 23, 2014|This restaurant was fantastic!  Our rese...|5|This restaurant was fantastic! Our reservations were for 6p and we had requested outside dining. We were seated on time and in a prime location. We were in Providence to attend the WaterFire and it was right across the street from Memorial Park. The food was terrific, three of us ordred the salmon off the Simple Grill menu and it was delicious. Service was great, we didn't feel rushed and afterwards we walked across the street to enjoy the waterfire. Highly recommend it!
August 23, 2014|Convenient for Waterfire|4|Good food & good location. Service started off good, but as the restaurant filled, became a bit frenetic. Two severs delivered the food to the table, but were not well coordinated with each other (leading to a falling steak knife which mercifully miss my leg).
August 23, 2014|this was our 4th year coming from Florid...|5|this was our 4th year coming from Florida to RI and having dinner with you then attending the Waterfires. Look forward to coming every year!! The food is always delish and the service is perfect!! Love the atmosphere also. Love Parkside!!
August 21, 2014|Pleasant Evening|5|Our waiter,Adam , made the 4 of us feel as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. He was attentive, yet not overbearing. His suggestions were appreciated. The food as pleasing as ever. The rotisserie chicken is an all time favorite of mine...but the salmon was exceptional also. Dessert list small but special...molten chocolate and caramel custard were perfect.
August 16, 2014|Always Great!|5|Love the Parkside. Have reviewed many times. Just go...
August 9, 2014|Waterfire dinner|4|Went here for dinner during waterfire with our inlaws who we're visiting from out of town. We've been quite a few times before and don't ever remember it being so noisy but attributed that to it being busy because of waterfire. Food was excellent as always but it took far too long for the food to come out. I like that this isn't a restaurant that rushes you but we've never waited this long for food here before, again they were busy because of waterfire so we understood. Our server was sweet and apologetic. Overall a good experience, not great as other times, but we will be back because waterfire night aside this is an exceptional place.
August 9, 2014|Disappointment|1|I had high expectations for my first visit to Parkside; both from friends and the menu on-line. The drinks were great, the appetizers large and flavorful (streak tartar and Thai dumplings), the soup special (lobster bisque) started the huge let down of the rest of the meal. There was no lobster, the color was unattractive, and far to much sherry. For entries we went with specials - pan seared halibut and lobster tortellini. The halibut was significantly over cooked, very very bland, and even more dry (even with extra sauce)- too bad it was beautiful piece of fish. The tortellini more a ravioli were just plain bad; course in presentation, lacking flavor and surrounded with fishy tasting mussels. The Creeps tasted like a butter dish.
August 9, 2014|Perfect Choice for WaterFire Night|4|"Most of the choices of meals at our table for six were quite delicious, but the lemon garlic chicken was unexceptional. Good fries, er, ""pommes frites."" I should have had the tenderloin salad, which I've had for lunch before and really liked. The menu is to my taste, cosmopolitan, but not effete. Now, I find it restrictive that on the review form my only choices for ""noise level"" are ""quiet,"" ""moderate"" and ""energetic."" Hey, how about ""too noisy""? Very loud in there, hard to hear or converse pleasantly and easily until later when the crowd thinned out. However, the location by the river is perfect if you are thinking of attending WaterFire afterward."
August 9, 2014|Great Dining Before Waterfire|4|We're not familiar with restaurants in Providence and found Parkside on Open Table. It turned out to be in a convenient location for walking to Waterfire, the food was excellent and we enjoyed being able to sit outside, The restaurant was packed when we arrived but we were greeted and seated immediately. Our waiter was a bit distracted but placed our order promptly and the timing of the food delivery was well paced. We had a light meal-- dumplings, crab cakes, a Caesar salad and a Cobb salad. Everything was fresh and tasty. We'll return to Parkside when we next visit Providence.(Please note, the noice level was moderate because we were sitting outside.)
August 9, 2014|Nice dinner with friends|4|This was the perfect place for a group of us to eat just before heading across the street to see Waterfire. The food is very good, leaning toward French, with some creative offerings, including some imaginative and delicious cocktails. The service was also very good, with enough wait staff so we didn't have to wait to ask for anything on a busy Saturday night.
August 1, 2014|Very good food and wine.|5|Girls night out. The food and wine was very good would definitely dine there again
July 28, 2014|Amazing Restaurant!|5|Everything about Parkside was fantastic! The food was amazing, and came out quickly, and the service was outstanding. Most importantly, the ambience was so perfect! I recommend this restaurant highly. The Apple Crisp dessert was amazing as well!!!
July 26, 2014|Great Vibe|4|Super friendly bar and waitstaff. Host and hostess spot opn with seating people during the rush. Great specials Always a blast before and after Waterfire
July 19, 2014|Birthday dinner|4|We had a wonderful birthday dinner here. The food was fabulous and the service was very good.
July 18, 2014|Beautiful Bistro|4|Excellent menu. Nice vibe and room felt like you were in a European Bistro. Arrived early, seated in the back of the restaurant, even though the front of the house had plenty of tables and a much nicer feel. Too close to the kitchen and it was a bit noisy. Service was ok, not great, but food made up for that. A nice place to dine after a long day of sight seeing.
July 14, 2014|First time, not the last.|5|I went to Parkside for dinner during Restaurant Weeks. It was nice to see a menu of items that make Restaurant Week worth it. The food was delicious. I am going to try and figure out the honey demi on the filet. Sweet Jesus was that amazing. The arancini was better than any I've had. The cheesecake was not too sweet, perfectly smooth, and the fresh strawberries really added a nice, refreshing touch to it. They rally helped cut through the richness. Great food, great service, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
July 12, 2014|Had a wonderful dinner!!|4|We chose to eat outside. Was a bit noisy inside. Service was excellent. We didn't feel rushed.
July 11, 2014|Great time|4|Definitely one of the best spots in Providence. Recommended by a friend and the restaurant did not disappoint. All was delicious. Thanks!
July 9, 2014|Delicious|5|We had lunch during Providence Restaurant Week. The food was delicious, especially the seviche w avocado appetizer. I don't know if it's on the every day menu or just for the special prix fix. If not, it should be! We'll be back for sure
July 5, 2014|Can not cook steaks|4|I got a steak for my meal and when it came it was under cooked for what I asked for. I asked for medium well and it came as medium to medium rare. The took it back and recoiled the same steak and brought it back. This time it was burnt on the outside. I was very disappointed. I would only recommend getting the chicken only.
July 5, 2014|We had a great experience. All staff wer...|5|We had a great experience. All staff were so pleasant from host to bartenders to wait staff. Food served hot and in a timely manner! Will definitely revisit this establishment. We are still discussing our great experience three days later!!!
June 28, 2014|great|4|Food is always consistent and good.. staff tends to rush you a little so don't order everything at once.. order your aps. Eat then order your main dish.
June 28, 2014|super fun|5|Although I used OpenTable to first reserve the table, my group number changed twice and I was more comfortable calling to confirm the changes since it was a Waterfire event night, and we needed to find out about parking. The dining experience was super, we werer accommodated with the booth I requested as seen online, the food was eclectic and superb, service outstanding, and it was the perfect location from which to tour the river and enjoy the event. We could not have been more pleased.
June 28, 2014|Great spot|4|The food was delicious and our server fantastic (until it was time to pay, when all servers seem to disappear). It was incredibly busy at 6 on a Saturday evening, so she was running around at top speed. The menu was diverse and included interesting choices for vegetarians, as well as giant portions of beautiful grilled meat for carnivores. Portions generally were huge - my roast duck salad was entree sized, not first course sized. No room for dessert, even if I'd had enough time. My only quibble was the noise level, which was more-than-energetic and made conversation during a 4-person reunion challenging.
June 28, 2014|Ok|2|The Thai Dumplings were delicious. The Salad perfect. However the waited didn't know the wine list and drink delivery was slow. My Bacon Wrapped Filet was flavorless(I don't know how that could be?) and my husband's duck came with one piece raw(ugh) in the middle. I wouldn't come here again.
Dined on June 28, 2014|Food|3|My husbands food was served lukewarm. Mine was pretty close to that as well. My son had pizza, which he enjoyed.
June 24, 2014|Parkside Food|5|$1 oysters on Tuesday were great as was the duck. The Waitress helped make the visit memorable. She was great.
June 19, 2014|Casual dining.|5|Good food at reasonable prices and good service too, BUT very noisy.
June 17, 2014|Always Amazing|5|On our recent visit, there were five of us having lunch. Each of us raved about the food. The filets were cooked to perfection, everything was fresh and tasty. Perfect place for lunch if you have only an hour and you never feel rushed.
June 14, 2014|Loved it!|5|Awesome food and great service! Far exceeded my expectations.
June 14, 2014|Have been a few times to Parkside.  The ...|4|Have been a few times to Parkside. The food is always good but the restaurant is small and seating is tight. This time we went just before Waterfire. Pro - valet parking so you can leave your car and wander the river after dinner; Con - so noisy due to being packed that we could hardly hear ourselves. Don't take an older person with limited hearing on a very busy night, as we did!
June 14, 2014|Always Excellent!|5|If you go, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Have the octopus appetizer. All the simple grills are great too!
June 7, 2014|Always Fabulous|5|I've been going to Parkside for many years, and even after the fire the restaurant continues to be superb. Parkside was a find back then and continues to be now. The food is consistently amazing, and the service is always great. I wish i could remember our server's name she was Fantastic. I was especially happy on this visit because I got the pleasure of introducing my boyfriend to the place, and he doesn't particularly enjoy the same type of restaurants I do. He's hard to please and he even fell in love with the place. We'll definitely be back!
June 3, 2014|Consistently excellent|4|service is attentive but unobtrusive, waiter was very friendly, food is high quality and delicious!
May 31, 2014|Parkside Gem|4|This restaurant on South Main Street has a nice selection of drinks to choose from, though I did not see their wine list. The bartender was accommodating in my request for a half pint of Shandy, which was delicious. My friend and I both ordered salads--the tuna nicoise and the beef tenderloin. Both were excellent and had good portions for the price. My steak was cooked perfectly. I nice bed of fresh greens and excellent service. I would go there again to try other items on the menu. Nice outdoor seating for summer facing the street looking out onto the memorial park. Parking is relatively easy on a Saturday though if Water Fire were happening, I would park on Benefit Street and walk down.
May 30, 2014|Excellent|5|This was our first time at Parkside. The food was outstanding and I like to cook and am picky. It had a good mix on the menu with some specialties. Happening atmosphere and would be a great place to hang at the bar. Service from Kelly was terrific and the price moderate. We ill be back!
May 24, 2014|The Best!|5|We frequent Parkside regularly. This weekend they accommodated our group of 30 people, in town for reunions and graduations, in about as seamless and expert a fashion as you can imagine. The food had everyone raving...meals were delivered promptly and at the same time...the drinks were great! The wait staff, led by Ryan, was terrific...and Adam was his usual cool efficient self! I often rave about Parkside in my reviews as the best overall restaurant in Providence. Oh, there are restaurants that do some things better (some of the food as art places) but no place is better and more consistent for an overall enjoyable dining experience!
May 21, 2014|delicious, abundant!|5|Enjoyed a business dinner with colleagues the other night. Appetizers were good, however, the grilled items were truly outstanding. rarely eat beef but ordered the strip steak special because it sounded divine. And it was. It was also HUGE. If you have a normal/modest appetite, skip the starters and save your appetite for the main course. I'll be back on a future visit to Providence.
May 20, 2014|stunningly bad experience|1|Hostile, abusive, terrible service.. for reasons inexplicable, on a not-busy evening. SImple salads were ordered an took inordinately long tme to arrive; presentationsloppy, quality poor. A poor showing from a place that had previously been quite nice in all respects. Wait-staff needs overhaul. Valet service great.
May 11, 2014|We went here for Mother's Day and it was...|4|We went here for Mother's Day and it was very good, as usual. Nice selections of foods and all very good and the Bloody Mary was very well done. Two of us had cashew chicken, one had the swordfish special and the other a pasta and sausage dish. Everyone really liked their food choice.
May 10, 2014|Great meal, fun place|5|We had a terrific meal at the Parkside. No complaints there! The only issue for the four of us was the noise level in the front by the bar. It probably didn't help that a Bruins playoff game was on. But luckily they were happy to move us to a table in the upper back where we could enjoy a conversation with good friends. They were great about that and everyone raved about their meals. Highly recommend unless you want a more intimate and quiet setting.
May 3, 2014|Outstanding|5|The food is excellent as is the service. The host was flexible when we changed the time of our reservation at the last minute and the wait staff made every effort to accommodate off menu combinations and choices. While the restaurant is a bit pricey, it is worth every penny. We do not live in or near Providence and were bemoaning the fact that we would probably not have a chance to return.
May 3, 2014|Pre Theater dinner|3|Nice spot. Good ambiance. Good service. Thought the food was quite expensive for what you received. Steak Frites was a $30 pile of French fries. Cashew chicken interesting dish but very strong / salty.
May 2, 2014|Excellent as always; we always pick the ...|5|Excellent as always; we always pick the chef's specials and are never disappointed! The spinach, Gorgonzola tortellini with steak was awesome as well as my husband's swordfish special!
April 28, 2014|Great night|4|We had a last minute work get together with visiting co-workers from the UK. Parkside accommodated our large party of 8 with very little notice. Food was spectacular and drinks were wonderful. Magnificent bartender Shane!
April 26, 2014|Always great!|5|"Food, drinks, and service always excellent. Our ""go to"" place in Providence. Simple Grill is an outstanding value."
April 23, 2014|OK FOOD, POOR SERVICE.|3|Went there for lunch with a few neighbors and I had a mixed experience. The hostess was very nice, friendly and smiley. Good first impression. The waitress had a very long face during our entire lunch and that was not cool. I had the cuban sandwich, which was nicely done, toasted with nice lean pieces of pork loin. The mustard sauce was a bit overwhelming for me, but it was an OK sandwich. The fries were not good. I left half of the order on my plate...and....I don't leave fries un-eaten. No..no... unless they are not good. The chicken pot pie was good, but was a bit too wet and creamy for my taste, with no real taste of a flaky crust. Overall an OK experience.
April 20, 2014|Wonderful|5|This is the first time that I went to the Parkside and I was not disappointed. The host sat us where we wanted without question which was nice. All of the food that we ordered was great and cooked to perfection. Overall a great meal in nice place with great service. We will definitely be back.
April 20, 2014|Easter Dinner|5|We were a group of 9 and had a wonderful time! The menu was extensive and everyone was delighted with their choices.
April 19, 2014|Great food - excellent wine list! Menu i...|4|Great food - excellent wine list! Menu is VERY reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Tables are pretty close together, which could be a little awkward, but the sound level at peak times makes up for it.
April 18, 2014|Good for Groups|3|Portions were generous (maybe too generous) and the service was great. We had 7:30 reservations and the Kitchen was backed up, so it was a long meal. Overall, not a bad experience. It's not gourmet, but it's not all bad.
April 13, 2014|Locals only it seems|3|Tried this spot while on a business trip but was fairly disappointed with the service received. Made a reservation through opentable, however my points weren't honored somehow? (Open table handled the discrepancy) Based on the service I received and noting the service others received, I would say this place is best served for locals. Bartender questioned my beverage choice while making an extremely rude face and comment. Food was eh, have def had better, as well as worse. Def wouldn't go back should I find myself in the Providence area again, as I'm sure there are other restaurants happy to have out of towners dining at their establishment.
April 13, 2014|Great Food HUGE Portions|5|We walked over while staying for the night to look at colleges. We all loved our food. My pasta with duck confit was outstanding. The octopus app was tremendous. The fried calamari delicious and also huge. Reasonably priced glasses of wine. Waitress was lovely. It was just what we needed after a long drive. If my son is lucky enough to attend Brown, I will keep coming back :)
April 12, 2014|Parkside Excellent Dining|5|I had dinner at Parkside last Saturday, The food was, as always, excellent. I also find the menu more interesting than most. The service was fine. Although it's noisy, there are some seats at the back of the restaurant that are not bad. I thoroughly enjoyed my evening there.
April 10, 2014|Great Lunch Spot|5|We went to the Parkside for lunch with a group of five people. Everyone loved their food selection, the prices are very reasonable and the quality of food exceptional.
April 5, 2014|Wonderful dining experience|5|The service was excellent, and the food was fantastic. Everyone at our table loved it!
March 29, 2014|Who's left overs are these?|4|Had a nice evening in a party of 4. Service was good, but the waiter was not the most attentive. The food was also good. The salmon was delicious. I found the pork dish bland. I had the beef short ribs. They were good, but extremely fatty. I prefer it when the chef removes most of the fat so I don't have to look at it. The menu said my dish came with a mix of root vegetables, but all I got was carrots. We had a delicious red wine. Only issue was the waiter mixed up my to-go leftover box with someone else so I got a surprise the next day when I found the bland pork in my box : ( Disappointing since I had saved half of my meal to eat another day. In the trash it went.
March 22, 2014|Another great dinner at Parkside|5|I have eaten at Parkside several times and have never been disappointed with the food or service. Our friends from Cape Cod met us there for dinner and they loved it as well. I can't wait to go back!
March 21, 2014|Just amazing|4|We stumbled onto the Parkside after walking around after the Providence Waterfire. That night we had one of the most amazing dinners, from the food, to the venue to the service, everything was top notch. And every time since then, maybe 10-15 times, the experience has been the same.
March 15, 2014|Great food, good service|4|Always happy when eating at Parkside. Drink at bar with very friendly bartender, Mike!
February 28, 2014|New experience every time|5|A great place for a romantic get away. We loved it so much we went back for more for second time and our last night before heading back home to our home state. Can't wait to visit again. Hopefully soon!
February 22, 2014|Great|4|Love this restaurant...food, service, location all great....just wish it wasn't so noisy.
February 22, 2014|riding on past glory|2|"food was OK , prices have skyrocketed , $36 for a steak that was not a prime steakhouse quality . This place is resting on its past reputation , and it seems like ownership has a take it or leave it attitude. Server was aloof,, once he realized we weren't ordering wine , and only one of our party of four had an appetizer with our meal, and after the main course actually came to the table and said "" yeah , anything else ? """
February 21, 2014|The food was amazing so and|5|The food was amazing so and so was our service. We got the special smelts as a appetizer which were pan fried. I also got the special pasta and it was fantastic and relatively inexpensive. The cocktails were from $9-10 and strong. We will definitely be good back soon .
February 21, 2014|Delicious. We have dined here many times...|5|Delicious. We have dined here many times. Did restaurant week as well. Everything was on point
Dined on February 14, 2014|Excellent Valentines Day Choice|4|We choose Parkside because we had her first date there several years ago. We both enjoy the arty bistro atmosphere and delicious varied menu. It was once again an excellent choice.
February 14, 2014|great food and service|5|The place has great food and service only down fall , it was very loud and hard to have a conversation.
February 14, 2014|Noisy and crowded|3|Very busy, crowded, could be because it was Valentine's Day. We were first seated at a table directly outside a backroom area which had servers going in and out constantly. We requested a different seat and were accommodated, but two other couples were shown the first table, one got up and left before ordering. The seating is very close and you cannot help but over hear the conversations of diners seated in adjacent tables. This place appears to be very popular given the number of people at the bar and also waiting to be seated. Definitely get a reservation if you choose to eat here. Food was ok but nothing spectacular.
February 14, 2014|Nice place|5|Good food and service. Had a reservation and did not wait when we arrived. Relaxing atmosphere.
February 14, 2014|Great food|5|Our first visit here and we booked reservations for Valentines dinner at 5:30. They moved it to 6:00 when we called ahead, stuck in traffic. Very elegant little restaurant. Dimly lit, dark wood, looks new. The wait staff was excellent. The menu was limited but the food was creative and very, very good. Surprised they had a tiny kitchen partially exposed to the back dining room. How they make all the meals there is magic. A little pricy overall, but expected.
February 14, 2014|Great food and service|5|The food was outstanding service was great little noisy but well worth it
February 1, 2014|Our table was ready when we|3|Our table was ready when we arrived. Service was efficient. Food was good but after an hour at the table, we definitely were being rushed along and I hadn't finished my dinner yet. That was annoying. The place was crowded and very loud. I have been there for lunch and enjoyed it much more. Wouldn't go back for dinner.
January 30, 2014|Consistently Favorable|5|We recently went to Parkside for a co-worker's birthday celebration. The food was excellent and service was also.
January 28, 2014|Great spot for a date night out!|4|The service was good, and the menu has choices fit for every taste. The calamari is one of our favorite appetizers. The atmosphere is pretty easy and low key, but romantic for a special night out.
January 25, 2014|Great Food But Bar Noise An Issue|4|The food and service at Parkside is always very good and during our recent visit we were not disappointed. The issue is the way the bar is essentially part of the dining area and on the Saturday night we visited was no exception to the point where it was difficult to hear the waiter and to keep a conversation going. Regards it is a great place and we will be back.
January 24, 2014|Rotisserie Chicken|4|If you're looking for an inexpensive place to dine with outstanding Rotisserie Chicken, then Parkside is for you, This chicken falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The french fries are to die for! The restaurant is a great spot for casual dining. Try and you won't be dissappointed.
January 20, 2014|Good but not oustanding|3|It was very cozy and the atmosphere was nice and relaxed and romantic. The food was just okay. I got the risotto special and it tasted more like a chicken casserole. The service was nice. It was a nice place to come and have a casual bit to eat, maybe before show or for a date, but I wouldn't recommend it for the food.
January 18, 2014|Our server spilled my martini.|3|Our server spilled my martini. It soaked the table, we brought it to his attention and he immediately cleaned it up. Our waiter could not speak clearly so we could hear the dinner specials. Unfourtnatly he read the specials from a piece of paper. Our salad and dinners arrived very quickly. I did feel they wanted to turn the table since it was 8:30pm when we were done with our dinner. Always good food and energetic scene.
January 18, 2014|We participated in the Restaurant|4|"We participated in the Restaurant week menu and we were all really pleased with our meals. Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable. The restaurant ambiance was warm and cozy. Our only negative was the host. We had requested a window seat, but when we got there the table was next to the door and it was very chilly. The men asked the host if it was possible to move, and he commented that we asked for a window table, reminding us not once, not twice, but three times, which we agreed right away that we did and we apologized. Then he continued to tell us that it was ""really messing him up"" not once, not twice, but again - three times. Really? We would have been okay if he just said no, but his response was so ridiculous."
January 18, 2014|Great Find!|4|I found this restaurant online to take my girlfriend on a nice date, and this place was perfect for us. The atmosphere was was was pleasant with a contemporary decor and attentive staff. From the moment we walked in the door a euphoric wave of welcome came over us and immediately we were put into an uplifting mood. The food was outstanding, we got two appetizers (fried dumplings and the duck rilette) and two entrees (rotisserie cashew chicken and the monk fish wrapped in bacon special), we wished that there was room for dessert. In all, I will definitely return again someday.
January 14, 2014|Great for a Birthday Treat|4|We treated my sister-in-law for her birthday. The food was great and it was a hit with my sister-in-law who is usually so hard to find a gift for.
January 13, 2014|Excellent|5|I would not think twice about dining at the Parkside - it was a wonderful experience.
January 12, 2014|Delicious|4|Went here before a show at the PPAC and it was delicious! The service was excellent, the good was superb, I will definitely be recommending to friends and family. Very happy!
January 11, 2014|great dinner|4|Everything we ordered was fantastic! The regular menu was so wonderful that we did not try the Restaurant Week selections, but everyone in our party was thrilled with their entrees. The Lamb & Rotisserie Chicken were highlights.
January 7, 2014|My friend and I went before|4|My friend and I went before the theater. The food was the food was good not excellent but it was good. Our waitress was excellent and the drinks were very good. I thought the prices were okay but my friend thought they were a little bit pricey! Tables are pretty close together but the noise level was not too bad.
January 4, 2014|Best in Providence!|5|I've written many detailed reviews for Parkside. I have nothing to add...Parkside remains the best all-round restaurant in the city. It's not the best in any one thing, but the sum of its parts outshines everyplace else...and I've been to all of them...
January 4, 2014|Girls night out|5|The four of us went to see wicked and arrived earlier than our reservation. It was our first time dining with them. They were completely ok with that and seated us right away. Everything was perfect from the service to the wine all the way though to dessert. Will definitely go back.
January 4, 2014|Great Night Out!|5|My husband and I took our daughter out for a nice dinner on Saturday before driving her back to college on Sunday morning. The food was very good and our server was very attentive. We enjoyed it very much.
December 30, 2013|Fabulous boeuf bourguignon|4|Had the stew on a very chilly afternoon. Outstanding! Restaurant was nearly deserted, as we were having lunch at 2:45. Quiet, friendly and enjoyable.
December 29, 2013|delicious|5|The ambiance was great, service excellent, great drink list. I had the filet mignon which was flavor full and conned to perfection, one of the best meals I've ever had.
December 7, 2013|Great experience! Creative|5|Great experience! Creative and inventive menu, but not so wild that you don't want to eat any of the items. Delicious food and a really great ambience. Prices just right, too, where it won't break the bank and you can eat there more than once in your life!
November 23, 2013|Beautiful food and atmosphere|5|I was visiting Providence for a college sporting event and took my adult son here as a special occasion. The food was simply beautiful. I can't recommend it highly enough.
November 22, 2013|Great food!|5|This was my second time here and I had the short ribs and dumplings and it was phenomenal! Service was excellent! Very easy to find and they offer valet!
November 16, 2013|Parkside is Outstanding!|5|The folks at this establishment have everything covered. From the hostess to the wait staff to the food, it was outstanding. My wife and I went for the first time. It was recommended by a friend who knows good food. We were not disappointed in the least bit. The waitress was very prompt, tending to our needs. The food and drinks were better than expected. We cannot wait to go back. Seems as though This is nothing new in the Providence restaurant scene. Try it. You won't be disappointed.
November 9, 2013|Delicious food before WaterFires!|4|We chose this restaurant because it had good reviews and was across from the WaterFires! This turned out to be a great choice especially with the valet parking !! We made reservations about a month before thankfully, as the restaurant was packed. Our table was ready and even though all the tables are close together, we were comfortable. I like how this restaurant serves half-bottles of wine with a good selection of choices. Three of us ordered the cod on the menu and another ordered the swordfish special. All of our meals were delicious!! Great choice with or without the WaterFires!!
November 7, 2013|Parkside is a great hot spot|5|Beautiful restaurant, very comfortable with great ambiance. The food was delicious and the service was perfect!

October 26, 2013|We were a party of 4 and all|4|We were a party of 4 and all enjoyed our Appetizers, entrees and dessert. We agreed that we would come again.
October 25, 2013|Somewhat unfocused...|3|"The menu was very intriguing, but was a hodge podge of French, Thai, continental, and italien. The restaurant boasts that it is ""manhattan style bistro"" which I guess means it can serve anything. My scallops (daily special) were terrific, my companion's Coq au Vin was adequate. Very dry, which is odd given that coq au vin is all about the sauce! Service was good, after a rocky start where my waiter no showed our table. I finally caught the eye of a waitress at the next table (seated after us, and served before us) who kindly took our table of two onto her service. Her first response was a bit cold and put out,but we worked through that. The ambience was good, though tables are set close together."
October 19, 2013|Great Food, Service and Value!|5|Just an overall excellent experience at Parkside Rotisserie. We had called earlier to let the restaurant know that we needed to push our reservation back by thirty minutes and they were very accomodating. The bartender (Dave) was excellent: very knowledgeable of the menu and poured a great cocktail. The other half of our party arrived 15 minutes after the pushed back reservation time, but the host never pressured us for an update. The server was a little soft spoken, but again very knowledgeable of the menu and offered good suggestions when asked for a recommendation. She was attentive without being at the table too often. Highly recommended!
October 12, 2013|Dinner /Parent's Weekend|4|Took our college student and friends out to Parkside Rotisserie and Bar for Saturday night dinner.Perfect for a group- the atmosphere was upbeat, and outside the river was bustling with Providence's WaterFire spectacle, so it was very festive. Each of us thought our dinner was delicious, and the servings were very generous. Many doggy bags went home that night and were enjoyed the next day. Fun night, good food!
October 12, 2013|Food was wonderful. You must|5|Food was wonderful. You must try the grilled octopus appetizer. It's very good. I've been there a couple of times and were equally impressed with the food and service.
October 12, 2013|Surprisingly High Quality Food!|5|Our dinner before Waterfire was superb. A bit noisy in the front section, but lively and bustling. The back section is a little more intimate and hearing-friendly.
October 5, 2013|Unique|4|It is a very energetic restaurant! We truly enjoyed the Baby Octopus for an appetizer. Although I requested a special preparation due to health issue, my dish was delicious. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was decadent .... fudge-like. The waitress ,Rachel, was very sweet, and patient and had great recommendations. Lastly, I was impressed with the Birthday Dessert presentation.
October 5, 2013|Excellent!|5|Tried Parkside after attending a show at PPAC. It was our first time. The experience and the food were excellent. We were very early for our reservations, yet was seated right away. I always worry that small places like this would be noisy, but the noise level was fine, it was refreshing to not be in a restaurant that puts the table next to you on top of us, there was plenty of space. The oysters were delicious, we tried all three varieties available. I had the swordfish special and it was incredible. The 1/2 chicken that was ordered was also excellent, could not believe it was only a half chicken, and the amount of fries was incredible. Overall, excellent!
Dined on October 5, 2013|Great night!|5|We had a wonderful dinner that evening with great friends from boston. The loved the resturant and the food.
October 4, 2013|Theater dinner|4|Staff/Atmosphere: We had an early dinner 5:30 (pre-theater), but the place was still lively and packed by 6pm. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but not overbearing. Great energy -- what you would expect from a bistro atmosphere. Food: - App:$1 oysters (3 types to choose) on Fridays after 4:30 -- the oysters were the perfect sweet and briny combo one would expect. - Dinner: my wife had the grilled filet special with roast fall veg. and a maple bacon gastrique. A little sweet, but cook to a perfect medium rare and a nice 10oz portion. I had the Coq au Vin - chicken was moist and the sauce had a rich depth. - Desert: lava cake, nothing to write home about - overdone and pretty small. Great dinner all and all.
October 2, 2013|Anniversary Dinner|5|I made the decision to take my wife here for our anniversary dinner. For it being my first time I was anxious to see how our experience would be. We were nothing short of amazed. The food was to die for,and the service was on point, if our server was busy another was checking on us. 5 stars in my book.
October 1, 2013|Great food and service. I|4|Great food and service. I was in Providence for a conference and planned a dinner for 15. We all even needed separate checks and the server was totally fine about it. He was knowledgeable about the menu and made perfect recommendations. I will definitely go back next time I am in Providence.
September 28, 2013|Great spot|5|Food is high quality. Excellent staff and service. One our favorites in Providence(where there are lots of great restaurants!)
September 28, 2013|Great evening!|5|Service and food could not be any better. We ate outside and enjoyed the nice fall evening while we enjoyed our fabulous dinner and great service. A must in Providence!
September 26, 2013|On the town|4|This is a favorite restaurant of ours in Providence. Parkside always offers a fabulous risotto that we generally order. The spring pea risotto is over the top fabulous.
September 24, 2013|Most enjoyable|4|We enjoyed a light lunch at Parkside. The food was excellent, as was the service.
September 23, 2013|Love this restaurant|4|Love this restaurant. My husband and I went for my birthday recently. Quiet,romantic. Food was good. Chocolate torte was wonderful.
September 21, 2013|Fighting couple 2 ft from our table|3|My boyfriend and I came in at 8pm a half hour earlier than our reservation at 830. We were going to grab a drink first, but our table was ready so we decided to sit down right away. Our table was right next to the door and bar which was extremely loud and annoying g. Also, the table to our left was a couple eating their entree. After their dinner they started fighting extremely loud, swearing and cursing at each other- it interrupted our romantic dinner due to how loud they were. We got over it and was happy when they were gone!!! Besides that annoying piece, the service was good. Waitstaff friendly. Will return maybe a night during the week!
September 21, 2013|Nice Evening @ Water Fire|4|Arrived early for our reservation and they accommodated us - which was very nice. It was a little slow at first but the waiter had all of the tables outside so he was hustling. Once he stopped by - the service was execellent. We both had the Pork Mignon. Both were a little tough in spots but great flaovor. Not sure about the bacon around the pork - it was actually the tough part in trying to cut the meat. Vegetables were outstanding - very tasty! The desserts were exellent - chocolate lava cake ala mode and creme brule. Pricing was extremely reasonable! Would definitley go back!!
September 20, 2013|Always a good choice|4|The food here is always consistent and good. The waitress was attentive. It was a little loud when the restaurant filled up. Love the spicy lemon chicken.
September 14, 2013|Always Great!|5|For my $$'s, the best overall dining experience in Providence. Had octopus appetizer and pork mignon simple grill...cost for the two is under $30...terrific! Dare you to find a better high quality meal for that price.
September 9, 2013|Always a great meal|5|"Parkside is consistently good with great service. Every time I go there I leave thinking ""why don't I go here more often?""."
September 7, 2013|Dinner for 2|5|Great wait staff, very well trained and they have great knowledge of the specials and describe them in great detail. I have had dinner here twice this summer on Water Fire nights and have had great meals and service.
September 7, 2013|Great WaterFire Destination!|4|Free valet parking and walk to WaterFire. Menu varied and charming. Prices excellent for quality. Service folks helpful. Make reservations in advance on WaterFire nights for best results. Great bar too. Risotto to die for. Bring sweater as highly air conditioned.
September 6, 2013|Excellent Food & Service|5|I went there for a relaxing night out in the city. Excellent service and food! I will return again in the future. I recommend their Banana Foster Bread Pudding, amazing!
August 24, 2013|The waitress was very good|4|The waitress was very good and very attentive. We had 2 of the nightly specials and they both were very good.
August 24, 2013|Great food at parkside. The|4|Great food at parkside. The one down side was even though we made a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes after our scheduled reservation time was for an outside table, and would have had to wait longer for one inside. It's understandable though that customers don't always leave at the time you expect them to, and a few minutes to wait is acceptable.
August 24, 2013|Great restaurant for Waterfire|4|Great restaurant for Waterfire as valets park car and can then walk to waterfire across the street and beyond. Noise level in restaurant on busy night makes it VERY difficult to hold a conversation. Sidewalk tables are nice on a warm evening and much quieter for a romantic dinner.
August 24, 2013|Nice every time|5|Parkside is the kind of place that we associate special occasions with. We love the bar area although we've never sat at it. We've sat at 6 different tables and prefer the banquets along the wall to the center tables. We've been there usually on the busy nights of the week, so shouldn't be surprised the the noise level is as high as it is. The level is not annoying and it does promote a convivial atmosphere. The food is always good. The Beef Short Ribs we just had and the Crispy Salmon dish were perfect. We also enjoy its proximity to the river walk and can often find free parking on East Main.
August 17, 2013|great place the filet is wonderful|5|great place the filet is wonderful best steak in Providence
August 10, 2013|Packed for Waterfire.|5|Saturday August 10 was a night for Waterfire in Providence and the restaurant was packed! However, the service and food were just as good as a typical night. One of our Providence favorites.
August 10, 2013|Service was not good and non-existe|2|Service was not good and non-existent during the second half of our meal. My wife's salmon/pasta meal was too salty, as was our bruscheta appetizer. Location is nice to be near water fire, but there are no views from where we were sitting (outside).
August 9, 2013|Best of providence|5|Never disappointed. Amazing specials and great dollar oysters mon-fri!
July 29, 2013|Best Italian EVER|5|Impressed with every aspect - especially the food. completely wowed. Parkside gets my vote for best meal during my East coast visit.
July 27, 2013|I have been to Parkside about|3|I have been to Parkside about 5 or 6 times. I was a little let down with the food this time as were some of my friends. It was very good in the past so I will go back. The restaurant was very quiet, nearly empty on a Saturday night in July. I had the beef short ribs and they weren't as good as in the past. Also the veggies, parsnips were not fully cooked. Some complained that the meal was bland.
July 27, 2013|'Personally found the food|4|'Personally found the food to be not quite up to Parkside's high standards. Wedge salad was mediocre, except for the bacon; stuffed lamb special was very average with flavorings that took away from the lamb itself, but the Stripe Bass was excellent. Watermelon and mint sorbet was lacking balanced flavors.Service excellent as usual.
July 27, 2013|Always a good experience|4|Parkside Rotisserie & Bar is one of our favorite restaurants in Providence. In fact, we like it (and some others) so much, we freqeuntly drive from Boston to have dinner in Providence. Our group of four ordered different dishes, all of which were delicious. I had the English pea risotto from the appetizer list as my main course. Hard to believe it wasn't a main course as the portion was quite large. It was delicately flavored and had several rock shrimp in the rissotto. The other members of our party had the hamburger, short ribs and chicken, and everyone raved about their chosen dishes. While not extensive, the wine list offers adequate choices in terms of the wines and prices.
July 27, 2013|Awesome Birthday!|5|Celebrated my birthday last month and the food made my day! The kitchen crew did such a wonderful job. I'm drooling even thinking about it. Service was excellent! Can't wait to go back, I've raved about this adorable place to several of my friends.
July 25, 2013|Birthday date night|5|I've been a fan on parkside for over 10 years. The service is always consistent and the food is always out of the park. Best rotisserie in the city. Crab cakes are also excellent. Parkside is a staple to the regular restaurants that I frequent in providence.
July 19, 2013|fabulous|5|We had never been and decided to give it a try based on the restaurant week menu. Everything was much better than we expected. Food came out at good intervals, our waitress was very attentive, but not overly where we felt she was bothering us. We were very pleased with everything. Even with a food allergy (gluten) I was able to eat all three courses. The waitress was knowledgeable about the allergy, checked with the chef, and immediately came back to let me know I would be able to enjoy everything and that he would be extra careful with my meal.
July 15, 2013|Just ok|2|Came here for restaurant week and was quite disappointed with the menu. The appetizer and entree lack finesse. Felt like they were thrown together in a hurry just for restaurant week.
July 13, 2013|Excellent food, Ok service & noisy|4|The subject heading pretty much sums it up. I ordered Stead Frites which was fantastic and cooked to my liking. We sat next to the window, the second table from the entrance. I found the waiter to be attentive at first but as the night went on he was less so. I found that a little annoying. However, what I found really annoying was the noise level in the restaurant. I could hardly hear what my date was talking about, the waiter had trouble hearing me and I had trouble hearing him. I would strongly recommend installing acoustic absorbing panels on the walls to reduce the reverberation time in the room. These panels do not look ghastly and may even enhance the decor of the establishment.
July 13, 2013|Awesome food & outstanding service!|5|The food was amazing, I had the herb marinated chicken and it was THE best chicken I've ever had....seriously. The wait staff here is so impressive, they are attentive, quick and whish by you so fast, you can feel the breeze! We will be back and highly recommend.

June 29, 2013|Always Excellent!!|5|I'm tired of giving Parkside rave reviews. It's one of my favorites. Just Go!
June 28, 2013|Perfect place for a date|5|Impeccable servers, variety on the menu, nice decor-it can get a little crowded/loud during prime dinner hours but that's only because so many people like to go there. Highly recommend.
Dined on June 22, 2013|We were only in Providence|4|We were only in Providence one night and needed a nice place that could seat a group of 9. Not only did they do that, they actually seated us in an area where we could hear the people at the other end of the table. Food and service were great and it was a cute little place. We love Open Table for finding awesome places while we are traveling.

May 31, 2013|Graduation celebration|5|We were celebrating with a group of 19. The service was excellent and the food was also excellent.

Thank you Parkside!!!
May 29, 2013|Gem of a restaurant|5|Good food and great wine list. Staff is well trained and knowledgeable with menu and suggest many specials. A great wine list and also wine by the glass. Great for private meeting and also a first time date. Keep up the good work.

Fabulous food, Emma was a very friendly and attentive waitress, good times had by all. We love Parkside and treat it as a special/romantic occasion stop. Very creative American fusion/with an Asian twist menu.

May 9, 2013|Great night out|5|Food and service were both really good.Duck and Beet Salad a meal on its own. Perfect for sharing.Swordfish special perhaps the best my wife has ever had. Filet was tasty and cooked perfectly. Finished the evening with a warm tart. What can get better than that? Dave was both knowledgeable and fun. Parkside Restaurant becoming a new go-to spot for a great night out.

April 26, 2013|Great atmosphere, generous|5|Great atmosphere, generous portions, quick and attentive service and fair prices really make Parkside a gem. Definitely on the louder side, but not so much you can't hear the person next to you, and the higher volume really just serves to amplify the energy and positive feel of the place. Highly recommended!
April 25, 2013|First Time is a Winner! While|5|"First Time is a Winner! While looking at restaurants for ""Dining for Life"" benefitting Aids Project RI, the Parkdside had the most enticing menu. As a first timer, I was impressed with everything. The food was divine, from appetizers to desert. Our waitress was fantastic-informative, knowledgable, and nice. We joked, learned about her education plans, her birthhome and so on. (she deserved a generous tip) We had crab cakes and fried wontons for appetizers ( delicious), house salad. Entrees were a three kind pork dish with grits. (the grits were the best). I had the veal chop special (amazing). Overall, one of the best meals ever."

March 31, 2013|enjoyable|5|Chose Parkside for a small, family Easter Dinner because I've previously experienced exceptional service and a menu that has something for everyone and the Parkside did not dissapoint for this occasion. Enjoyed a leisurely, delicious, 3 course dinner served by a professional and attentive staff.
March 31, 2013|Consistent Phenomenal Dining|5|On the famed East Side of downtown Providence near historic Court house and Brown University. Wonderful walking neighborhood with attractive shops and theatres nearby. A sensational Bar and Restaurant scene. Always tantalizing menu and bar drinks. Mark L.

March 14, 2013|FOOD WAS GREAT - BUT WAY TOOOOO|4|FOOD WAS GREAT - BUT WAY TOOOOO NOISY - WE WEREN'T RUSHED, BUT THE TABLES ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT YOU CONSTANTLY BUMP INTO THE PERSON IN BACK OF YOU. THIS WAS A THURSDAY NIGHT - I HATE TO SEE IT ON A WEEKEND.
March 4, 2013|Just too noisy!|3|The food was very good, and so were the martinis, but it is just too crowded and loud in there. The tables are too close together and you feel like you are sitting in the lap of the person at the next table. You really cannot talk about anything personal because conversations are able to be heard by your neighbors. Not very intimate. Perhaps better for a group - not romantic.
March 4, 2013|We visited the restaurant|5|We visited the restaurant to celebrate a co-worker's birthday. We loved the relaxed feel of Parkside. Everyone loved the food and the service was perfect. We will definitely visit again.

February 17, 2013|Great Place, Wonderful Food|5|We had amazing service at Parkside for our party of 5 -- and everyone had a delicious and wonderful meal -- from the chicken to steaks and a burger. The red velvet cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake were also pretty fantastic. We had a great time and would highly recommend.
February 15, 2013|Perfect lunch date location|4|When arriving at Parkside, during the lunch hour rush, we were quickly sitted and attended to. The waiter was very attentive and helpful in choosing our entrees. The bartender had a camaraderie with what I can only assume to be the regular visitors to this establishment which made it a welcoming atmosphere. We took a leisurely lunch and were not rushed at all. The food was delicious especially the roasted corn and squash soup and shellfish pie! Perfect venue for a nice lunch out!
February 14, 2013|Excellent Service & Food!|5|We have been to Parkside many times and it is always excellent food and service every time we go. A very romantic place to take that special person!

January 29, 2013|The variety of menu choices|4|The variety of menu choices ensured that everyone in our party of 10 was able to get something they really wanted to have - and the fact that the table got very quiet once the food was served was testament to how delicious everything was! Their rotissere chicken is reason enough to dine here. The lunch salads are just the right mixture of greens and protein to keep a hard worker going all afternoon.
January 27, 2013|Had a great dining experience|5|Had a great dining experience at this restaurant. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and he loved it too! Will definitely be going back
January 26, 2013|A bit pricey, but worth it!|4|A bit pricey, but worth it! The seasonal Nantucket Bay scallop appetizer was a delightful mix of light (the scallops) and heartier (chorizo in the sauce) flavors. The Basque Shellfish stew was also quite tasty -- I really wanted to pick up the bowl and guzzle the broth, but I restrained myself and soaked it up in the sourdough toast instead. The meal was worth the trek in the wicked (13 degree) cold.
January 25, 2013|We went for Providence Restaurant|3|We went for Providence Restaurant week. Friend had the tacos which she said were excellent; I had the beef sandwich and it was not great. A plate load of french fries, wet sliced beef between two slices of french loaf. It was not what I was expecting from Parkside, but it was okay. Normally this place is very good.
January 19, 2013|Great experience with friendly|5|Great experience with friendly staff. Will go back for sure.
January 5, 2013|Great food & wine, tight seating.|4|Impressed by the menu & specials. My tuna special was melt in your mouth. Other diners with me rated it a B+/A- for food. Good wine list. Very good service. Only minor complaint is that the seating is quite tight. Almost impossible not to be bumped or have close encounters with other diners squeezing in between tables.

January 4, 2013|Outstanding!|5|Our boss took the administrative staff to lunch as appreciation for the work we do...I have been to Parkside many times, but my co-workers have not.

December 31, 2012|Always Outstanding!|5|New Year's Eve menu was excellent. We're long time regulars. Value the consistency and value...the menu allows you to dine on both a modest or pricier budget. Best made and poured drinks on the Providence restaurant scene!

My husband & I have been celebrating New Year's Eve T Parkside for several years and have never been disappointed. The food selection is always great and if you don't see what you want, just ask your wait staff the will do what they can to accommodate! Great drinks, fabulous desserts so what are you waiting for, make a reservation for tonight. I hope your 2013 is full of good food & laughter!
December 21, 2012|Matt Puccini|5|Fantastic place. Great service and no problem with special requests. Food was outstanding - particularly the specials and the prices were reasonable. We liked the ambience too - low lighting, big roomy booths and a stately bar. Providence is teaming with great eateries to explore but we will definitely put this one on our short list for another visit.

Service was also excellent, even though it was abusy Saturday night. We'd gladly recommend this to others.

So we decided to go, this was a few years ago, since then, this is our favorite spot. We go on anniversary's, special occations, date nite. I have been away working since Nov 4th, and my wife and I needed to catch up and have a fantastic nite so we of course went to Parkside. Parkside is just great overall. Food, Service, setting..... We love it.
December 7, 2012|My wife and I love Parkside.|5|My wife and I love Parkside. We have been there numerous times and will continue to be regular guests at Parkside. Our son was visiting from Seattle on our most recent visit and he expressed favorably his opinion of the restaurant to include how delicious our meals were, the exceptional service and the overall feel and mood of the restaurant.
December 2, 2012|The food was terrible! Had|1|The food was terrible! Had the Salmon it was so dry way too many lentils on dish no sauce to help get the dry fish down. We also got the special veal chop the meat was so tough a steak knife couldn't cut it. The plate was swimming in polenta this is a suppose go with the veal too much let the veal be the dish not polenta. My son got a pizza it arrived burnt and tasteless. Not children friendly in any way. The most disappointing was the rotiessser chicken warmed up after cooking during the day? This wasn't even on during our visit ? This should be what people notice when they are in restaurant.

We found the service, wine and drink selections and menu choices as good as ever. While 4 out of 5 really enjoyed their meals, one person found his entree choice inedible - beef tenderloin was too salty. The restaurant graciously took that off of our bill.

Portions are always generous. On this trip, 3 of the 4 meals were very good. I ordered the Three Little Pigs. I was very disappointed with this entree. The St Louis ribs tasted like they had been cooked a couple days before and reheated, and the pork sirloin was thin and dry. The third ""pig"" the pork belly however was flavorful and moist. I would definitely go again, as anyone can have an off night, and their track record is pretty good with us, but wont order that entree again."

October 13, 2012|Ordered the filet medium rare|3|Ordered the filet medium rare and it was delivered medium well. I don't even think it was filet. The meat was very grainy. They offered to cook me another one but I was running late and couldn't wait. I did eat some of it. The filet was suppose to come with gnocchi but they were out. It was replaced with potato croquette. One bight of that was to many. They did take my meal off the check, but I wasn't really looking for that. I just wanted a good meal. I have dined here before and has been great. I guess it was just an off night.

Our waiter was very helpful, attentive, and informative. Food came to table in a timely manner. we were near the kitchen, so we appreciated the warmth on a Fall evening. Restaurant was crowded. Food delicious. We all enjoyed our meals. As we were leaving, we met a nice couple, who told us this they are regulars here. Since I travel here for business, I will be back, with my coworkers. A great find.

October 7, 2012|Maybe it was because it was|2|Maybe it was because it was a Sunday. The appetizers were better than the rest of the meal. Drinks, wine, and beer were good. Bread was not so great - an with all those wonderful bakeries in Providence! My mother had one of the rotisserie chicken dishes. She's 83 and was served the chicken set on top of a pile of not-so-warm french fries. Maybe cutting the bird into thirds would make it easier to eat. And skip the fries. The salad was good. The lamb shanks and tortelloni - well the pasta was very good, but the lamb shanks were dry, tasteless, and unappealing. The filet special didn't even taste like a steak - more like a roast beef. The vegetables accompanying the steak were wonderful - no starch served with the meal though.
October 6, 2012|We enjoyed a great dinner|4|We enjoyed a great dinner and our server Dave was helpful, fun and really knew what he was talking about when it came to the food. Great atmosphere and also loved then cocktail choices!

September 30, 2012|Winter Vegtable at its finest|5|"The ""White Farm"" Pork Rach with the Winter Vegtables were out of this world."
September 22, 2012|Where to start... the bread|1|"Where to start... the bread was dry and probably a day old, the mojito tasted only of alcohol, it was so noisy you had to shout to be heard (but good for them as the place was full), my water glass remained empty throughout most of the meal and was filled only as we paid the check. Those were the small annoyances... we ordered the 'asparagus appetizer'; we got the special asparagus salad which we ate anyway rather than make a fuss, but it was oily and bland. Could the waiter have clarified? My pork dish, also a special, was so tough I had to saw through the meat and sent it back (which I never do). It was replaced, but the damage was done... no ""can we offer you a dessert for your trouble?"" my companion was eating alone for a while, etc"
September 22, 2012|Always happy with the food|4|Always happy with the food choices and qulity. Service time can vary, but usually good. Noisy in some areas near the bar, but to be expected. Sitting in the back room is quieter and also pleasant. A fun place.
September 22, 2012|Consistent!!|5|Good Food...Great drinks...Great Service...Great atmosphere. Consistently good...can't go wrong for a night out...
September 15, 2012|Nice, friendly, high-energy|3|"Nice, friendly, high-energy kind of place. Very competent wait staff. However, we all found the food rather underwhelming. For the most part, nothing seemed freshly prepared, so things like the short ribs and ""3 little pigs"" were, although flavorful, rather dry and not so tender. Perhaps some more sauce could have helped."
September 15, 2012|Always a Favorite!!|5|"There's no better place on a busy Waterfire night, or anytime for that matter than the Parkside. Although you can't say Parkside is ""the best"" in any single category among the restaurants in Providence...it is however the most consistent and for my money one of the best run restaurants in Town. The food is always very good, the portions healthy, and the martinis perfectly made and generously poured. There's nothing I hate worse than paying up to $15 (not what Parkside charges) for a cocktail, only to receive what amounts to a ""half pour"" in the glass. Not an issue at Parkside, who've got to have the best bartenders in town. Overall, in my opinion, Parkside is the best quality/value proposition in Providence."
September 15, 2012|Great find!|5|Food was fantastic and they were extremely accommodating to my kids even though it wasn't necessarily meant as a place for kids. Everyone was fantastic! Valet parking in the middle of the city is ALWAYS a plus!
September 15, 2012|Nice meal before start of WaterFire|4|Always a nice meal, with a sophisticated flair. Wonderful restaurant for those attending WaterFire. We started with drinks outdoors, then moved inside for dinner, and i thought it was very nice how they accomodated that on such a busy evening. We sat on the upper level, which I recommend on very busy evenings if you want a quieter meal. We loved being within sight of the open kitchen, and watching the 4 gentlemen put on a show ... these guys worked their butts off! Food was excellent, good variety and quality. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because they had run out of the wine we selected. Other than this, a very enjoyable experience.
September 11, 2012|We've been to Parkside four|3|We've been to Parkside four or five times. On our last visit, the food was perfect but the service was not. I believe that our server just didn't have the right training, especially with wine service. She also went missing after our dinners were served and my husband had to get up to ask for pepper. The time before, the service was perfect but the food was not. For our tastes, the rotisserie items tend to be overdone but everything else we have ordered has been great. The starters are yummy and we're hoping that the foie gras shows up on the menu again soon. We will definitely be back.
September 7, 2012|One of my Favoriate's|5|Adam and staff do a great job. We have never been disappointed and are so glad that you all reopened. You were sorely missed the 5 months that you all were closed.
September 5, 2012|We hadn't been to the Parkside|4|We hadn't been to the Parkside in a while and after our last dinner asking ourselves why we had waited so long. We won't make that mistake again. Great service, ambiance and just love the aps. The meal was just unique enough to differentiate it from so many of the other places around. Go, you'll enjoy.
August 29, 2012|I have been to the Parkside|3|I have been to the Parkside probably 4x or 5x in 18 months. It was nice to see that the ambience had been enhanced with the addition of the half-round booths on right hand side since my last visit. My group of six met at bar for dinner (with two of the six joining us when we we were seated). The waiter was prompt, courteous and suggested a couple of great drink choices for some of the guests. And given his prowess with the drinks, we asked for dinner recommendations. He pushed 3 of us towards the rotisserie (spicy lemon chicken). I love chicken - but would have never ordered it out had it not been recommended. Regardless, the 3 chicken meals were bland and very dry at best. Big disappointment!! A shame, as atmosphere/booth - good.
August 27, 2012|The parkside always pleases.|4|The parkside always pleases. Rotisserie items are always outstanding and the duck confit was delicious. People watching from front window seats is always entertaining, while tables inside are cozy and inviting. Service is attentive while not lurking, and wait staff is knowledgeable.
August 18, 2012|Too noisy!!|2|"This is the 2nd time I have taken my friend to dinner here while she was visiting from Florida. We wanted to experience the restaurant again and view Waterfire 8/18/12. The area in front of the maitre d' was so crowded it could have been a fire hazard. The poor service people had to keep moving bodies out of the way to service the people outside. It was so noisy my friend and I couldn't even talk to each other. Ron, our waiter, was just okay. He was rushed and once a party of 8 arrived next to us, he had his hands full. The double pork chop my friend had was undercooked and needed to be taken back to the kitchen. My steak tips, a special, were slightly tough to cut even though they were ""medium"". Not a good experience."
August 18, 2012|A little too noisy & crowded|3|A little too noisy & crowded for me. chicken is a signature dish for this restaurant but mine was a little dry. Too many other great places in Providence for me to recommend this one.

Still very noisy probably due to the open kitchen in the midst of the dining room but still okay. Food is average and expensive. Our server, Destinie, was exceptional in her professionalism, beautiful appearance and polished interpersonal skills. She is a very class act. We would return on occasion.
August 1, 2012|AIR CONDITIONING WAS INADEQUATE,|4|"AIR CONDITIONING WAS INADEQUATE, CREATING A HUMID ATMOSPHERE ON A WARM NIGHT. THE FAMOUS ""ROTISSERIE"" CHICKEN WAS OVERCOOKED, DRY, AND UNIMAGINATIVE. I MAKE BETTER AT HOME. THE APPETIZERS WERE TASTY AND CREATIVE. THE DRINKS WERE GREAT, AND THE SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD. WHY ON EARTH THEY HAD TO JAM US, A PARTY OF SEVEN, RIGHT NEXT TO THE NOISY BAR RATHER THAN IN A MORE RELAXED SETTING FURTHER IN THE BACK IS BEYOND ME. IT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A GREAT PLACE, BUT WITHOUT FURTHER REFINEMENT, IT WILL ONLY BE A TWO NIGHT A WEEK CROWD INSTEAD OF A NEIGHBORHOOD ""GOTTA GO THERE !"" BISTRO."
July 21, 2012|My wife and I wanted to check|2|"My wife and I wanted to check out Providence restaurant weeks before it was over. We had always wanted to check this place out, so I made a reservation for this past Saturday evening. We arrived to a pretty busy place. Glad we had made the reservations! The hostess seated us outside ""al fresco"" which would have been nice had we not been right by the entrance. The prix fixed menu seemed really nice focusing on what they are known for which is rotissiere food. My wife and I ordered the cannelini beans with sausage. Seemed like we were off to a great start, very tasty! Unfortunately the rest of the meal did not compare, my wife had the chicken and I had the pork tenderloin. Both were very dry, we were very disappointed."

Overall an above average dinner, but not ""wow"" but did not break the bank either. Great service and nice ambience (bistro with quiet bar). Would return since was our first visit we would want to see the quality of the next meal."

The food was outstanding, perfectly cooked, the server was attentive but left time in between so you didn't feel rushed, so all the dishes came out with plenty of time in between. If you don't have that kind of time I'm sure you could ask them to check back more frequently, or bring courses closer together, but I enjoyed my extended lunch there.
July 13, 2012|Great food - Great service!|5|Parkside is our favorite restaurant and Ron is our favorite waiter. The food is fantastic, from everyday menu items to the super specials from the kitchen!

Each time we've been, the noise level is always so loud it is necessary to yell in order to carry on a conversation. This makes for an unpleasant evening. We won't be returning.

One of our group had to send her Pancetta wrapped Fillet back as it was overcooked for what she ordered. They not only replaced it without a blink but gave her a small salad in the meantime to tide her over. Our server, Dave, was excellent, and patient with us! Menu very diversed for choice and price, so something for everyone. Will be back.

The waitress was really good and made some accommodations with the orders. The food was excellent. The final bill without tip came to $55 per person and that's not bad considering that many had cocktails and there were multiple appetizers. Nice job by Parkside on a high pressure day. I had the rib eye and it was excellent. Others had the pork, hamburger with lobster, pasta with chicken and steak frites. ten people and no one had anything bad to say. My one comment is that the antipasto need clarity. There was a great hosue made salami that needs to be showcased.

April 28, 2012|Disappointing|2|"I really wanted to like this place (we visited from NYC on a weekend vacation) and I will say that the Shrimp cocktail was phenomenal and the duck breast was cooked to perfection, however my Duck Salad was advertised as coming with Duck Breast & Duck confit. Well, there was no duck confit on it and when I mentioned it to my server, he just said, ""Oh"" shrugged, and walked away. With that kind of service, I wouldn't return. The mac & cheese wasn't very good and my boyfriend had the Rotisserie cashew chicken (which was recommended) and he said it was ""Just okay."" His fries looked delicious but were under-seasoned and bit mushy. The salad had large lettuce leaves w/cubed beets/pears which made it impossible to get everything in one bite."

March 31, 2012|Exceptional|5|This was our first time at Parkside and it will not be our last. I had made the reservation on Saturday afternoon for a 7:30 table that evening. We walked in at exactly 7:30 and our table was waiting for US... The waiter came right over and fill our glasses with water. Then our server came right over to take a drink order and tell us about the specials ( the menu was also waiting on our table for us)! We were sitted right at the bar area, and it was lively!! However we will still able to hold a conversation thruout dinner. The food was excellent. My husband had the steak special and I had the halibut special along with the grilled octopus app. The deserts were also wonderful. We would definately recommend this restaurant.

March 9, 2012|Love Parkside!|5|Absolutely love the Parkside! everything here is great but the beef short rib is amazing. Friendly, attentive service without making you feel rushed. Bar is small and usually crowded which leads to a vibrant scene in the front of the restaurant. The quieter tables are in the back of the restaurant. So, ask for a table in the back when making your reservation if you are on a date night, front if with a group. Can't wait to go back.

Ridiculous!!! the tuna appetizer made no sense whatsoever. Tuna tartar and then one scallop and one shrimp cocktail??? How do you split that appetizer. The steak frites again with a mountain of greens over the steak and fries. What is it with this guy and greens?? Very disapointed. I have been going there twice a year for 15 years and this menu and new chef is a joke. I can't believe that Steve D. approves of the kitchen.

Made up for lack if attention at the end of the dinner but it was to late. I like to tip very well, at least 30%,but the waiter did not receive it. Not a bad tip but not as good as ir could have been. I would not recommend this place. I have had better food at establishments with fewer stars. My date was not impressed.

January 26, 2012|A rather disappointing experience.|3|A rather disappointing experience. This was our first visit after hearing many good things. For this reason my girl friend and I decided to try it during restaurant week. We both decided upon the Kobe Beef burger with lobster, and we both ordered them cooked medium. When they were brought to the table, they were over cooked, dry and charred. When it came to dessert, we were both brought the incorrect food, and when we brought this to our waiters attention, he actually questioned us. Not sure if I would return, or recommend that anyone take their chances either.

The lights are dimmed and there its quit quite. I went during restaurant week and had the crispy salmon, which was cooked well. The Thai Dumpling were yummy; it has a sweet and sour taste to it and not too deep fried. The crab cake was fabolous! The drinks are a bit pricey but worth it! As for the service, it was fair. The waitress was friendly but not as attentive as she was with the other tables. However, I would still recommend this restaurant. You may have better service then we did. =)

Get the pappardelle dish, fresh pasta, duck confit, crimini mushrooms, serrano ham, in a mushroom cream sauce, best thing I have eaten in a long time, just get it. Ask to sit up front for a more lively crowd, the kitchen view in the back is fun but the kitchen traffic gets a little hectic.

The server did compensate by providing us with complimentary cappuccinos. AFter our entrees were cleared we were asked if we wanted anything else; we had to request dessert menus. My friend was taking her time eating dessert, and the server asked if she'd like it to be cleared, but she was still working on it. A few minutes later, he returned and ""jokingly"" said ""Okay, I'm clearing this now"" and cleared her dessert!"

No apology just a snide comment oh I didn't see you. Mind you the area we sat is very small and he was serving a large party one table over from us. He also did not come to check on us until we were well into our meal. At that point my husband asked for a glass of wine that he forgot to bring until we were almost finished and his comment do you still want this.

February 19, 2011|My third time eating here,|2|"My third time eating here, I was unhappy with my entree (""Whole Wheat Penne""). There wasn't anything wrong with. I just didn't like it. It lacked flavor, which was surprising b/c it had, what seemed to be, a good mix as recipe as described on the menu. A curious thing about this restaurant is that the servers are always men - tall, thin, and handsome. It makes me question if the restaurant participates in discriminatory hiring practices. Offering the benefit of the doubt, this is my third time eating here on a Saturday evening."

Imagine her and my delight when a beautifully decorated plate with a piece of cheese cake was presented at the end of the delicious meal.Not only was my dining partner's birthday noted, the cake was free, unlike other restaurants. Our server was attentive yet not over-bearing. Our water glasses were always full. I changed my mind about window seating and our server/host did not miss a beat. We exclamed to each other that we could not remember eating a more tender piece of steak. Everything about our experience was top-notch. Before our lunch was over we decided to return to Parkside for another outstanding lunch. Congratulations to all for a wonderful experience!

It is not a large restaurant and perhaps because the bar is in the same roomas most of the diners it tends to be a bit more noisy than some might like, but it does not detract from the overall experience. I definitely recommend it.
February 12, 2011|Awesome experience. Food|5|Awesome experience. Food was great ( interesting menu with unusual choices for the area but also some ataples for the less adventuresome). Friendly, efficient service. The Parkside is small and noisey but it actually adds to the fun social experience. A solid A rating.

January 28, 2011|My husband and I went to Parkside|5|My husband and I went to Parkside expecting to take advantage of the Providence Restaurant Week Menu, but we were instead intrigued by the specials, so we each ended up getting one of the specials, myself a smoked mozzerella ravioli and my husband a veal chop. Both were excellent, with a very knowledgeable server. It was a little loud in there, but it was also a Friday night so to be expected with a busy place.

January 21, 2011|Great Food, Great Service.|5|My husband and I dined at Parkside last night. We were seated immediately upon arrival and everything came from the kitchen in a timely manner. Our server's name was Domenick and he was great. He was very professional and attentive. He should be commended for the way he was able to recite the daily specials -- I would never be able to remember all that! The food was very good, my husband ordered the NY Strip and it was cooked perfectly. The Au Gratin Potatoes are delish. This was our second visit to Parkside and we will be back.
January 15, 2011|We went to Parkside on a Saturday|4|We went to Parkside on a Saturday night with friends and had a great time. The restaurant was crowded which made for a festive atmosphere. It was perfect for us, but if you were looking for a quite dinner it might not be for you. The food was great (we had shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, a pasta dish and pork from the rotisserie) and the prices VERY reasonable. I was surprised when we got out of there for $70 per person which included a dozen shrimp, 2 orders of crab cake, 4 entrees, 2 bottles of wine and a few draft beers. We will definitely go back for more.
January 13, 2011|One of Providence's best restaurant|5|One of Providence's best restaurants... less formal than some of the older establishments, but rather is casual, warm, and inviting. The food is excellent: creative, no single theme, simple and complex dishes. Ambiance is great: cozy but not cramped, nice bar. Service is OK; wait staff isn't same par as a major steakhouse or high end Italian place, but is fine.

The regular menu offers delicious options with interesting tastes and textures. I had the sea bass that was cooked perfectly with a light, delightful broth and bok choy...I never knew I liked bok choy! The highlight of Parkside is the rotisserie -- anything you get done by that method will be outstanding. My dining companions had the beef tenderloin special that was so tender you could cut it with a fork and full of flavor. The bar scene is lively, but doesn't interfere with the dining and the drinks are top notch too. Service was excellent.

An unusual find in Providence, per someone who was born and raised in Providence. It's good for groups, but it is a small restaurant. So, you'll probably be the only group in there if you make the reservation in time. In fact, in thinking about it, it'd probably be a fun time for a group with its small-but-energetic atmosphere - and, of course, your being the only group. Enjoy.

December 3, 2010|My husband and I had lunch|2|My husband and I had lunch at Parkside and the chicken was dry and sat on top of greasy French fries. My husband ordered a steak sandwich and couldn't finish it because of gristle and toughness. The waiter was very good and attentive however. (he didn't cook the food). We have been to Parkside for dinner during Waterfire and it was a very good experience It was therefore a disappointment to eat such a poor meal, considering it's cost. Hard to decide if we would go back.
