We had to ask for the specials and were told of just one. Later on we heard there were several including a tuna dish my wife would have ordered. When I questioned why the appetizer was taking so long, the waiter stated we did not order one. He eventually realized he wrote it at the bottom of his notes. Our drinks were also weak. Dinner was on the expensive side for what we received. Probably will not be back....

February 16, 2016|It's the little things that count (or don't)|3|We went to Circe for dinner before a show at PPAC. We made a reservation for 5 pm so we would have plenty of time for a 7 pm curtain. Per Open table, they had valet parking only Wed - Sat, so as we were there on a Tuesday, we parked in the lot next door, which is only open until 9, so we had to repark for the show. As it happened, after we parked in the lot, it turned out they do offer valet on Tuesday! We were seated immediately at an odd shaped table in the front. There were four of us, so it was somewhat awkward as two people were along the banquet and the other two were on opposite ends of the rectangle. It made conversation a little difficult. A waiter came over relatively quickly, then went to get water and give us time to decide on the wine. I guess he forgot about us, because eventually the maitre d' came with water and took our drink order. When our waiter finally came back, we asked if they had any special additions to the menu. He offered to check with the kitchen. Once our food was ordered and received, it was delicious, but the service remained spotty. We had to rely on the Maitre D' for more drinks and water, and eventually to ask for the check. He assured us they would hold our car at the valet through the show. When we explained about the valet/garage dilemma, he said Tuesday Valet was a relatively new thing. We went to the show, opened the program and one of the very first pages was an ad for 10% off your meal at Circe with your show tickets! Just saying, it would have been nice if the Maitre D' had mentioned that during our conversation about getting to the show on time....
February 16, 2016|So glad I found you, Circe!|5|Valet parking on a torrential rain and windy night=perfect. Five minutes to the theater=perfect. Greeting and seating=perfect. Waitstaff attentive and helpful=perfect. Food exceptional=perfect. On a first time visit to Circe I was so happy that I found you on the internet and through Open Table. I have singing your praises to all I know. We had small plates. Each one was memorable. In particular I highly recommend the Maine lobster risotto with avacado ice cream. I also recommend the bomster scallop ceviche. Tucked away on lower Weybosset Street slightly opposite The Arcade, this is definitely a hidden gem. I will certainly return.
February 14, 2016|Valentines day dining|4|We went here for Valentines. I had the wild boar bolognese, it was good but not great. The bomster scallop ceviche as an appetizer was also good, maybe very good. My wife had the braised short rib, which was excellent. The service was good, it was busy so waiting and patience is understanding. The waiter did not ask if my wife wanted to take home her remaining portion though, which was substantial. She was disappointed with that. But, still, overall it was good to very good. I will try this place again. The braised short rib's made me re-think this place as we were leaving. and I liked the menu, it was interesting and thoughtful.
February 14, 2016|special V day dinner|5|Hubby took me out for V - day , it was perfect ! Items are large serving size , you wont leave hungry . Deserts are pretty good too.
February 14, 2016|Nice evening in Providence|4|"My wife and I found the menu to be rewarding in many ways. As this was Valentine's Day, I was glad to see that there was not a prix fixe menu, designed for the holiday. I order frutti dimari at many of the restaurants where we dine and Circe did not disappoint at all. I enjoyed not only the wonderful selection in the dish but also in its unique presentation. I found both the waitstaff and the management to be attentive without being overbearing. I also liked the fact that the host assisted when necessary in serving dishes and refreshing drinks. Oftentimes, there is a great divide between the two parts of the restaurant in this respect. My wife and I sat in the open area, second-floor, which was nice and warm on an extremely cold evening. Circe's knowledge of ""potions and herbs"" will definitely bring us back."

February 13, 2016|Best meal I've had in a long time!|5|Everything was top notch. My wife and I both agreed that it was by far the best overall meal we've had in quite a while. Definately try the lobster risotto and calamari as an appitizer.

January 29, 2016|Great Place Eat Before A Show|5|They were very patient with us, and got us out in time for our theatre performance. The food was great. I wish the beet appetizer were lighter, with no cheese, and that we had had the time to order some of the fabulous entrees which we were told would make us late to the theatre production we had tickets for. All but two or three of the desserts we were also told would take too much time. Give yourself more than an hour to eat! Only a five minute walk to the Providence Performing Arts Center. Worth it.
January 27, 2016|Great before theater|4|We went for an early dinner before theater in Providence. We'd never been there, but chose it because of a great menu and proximity to PPAC. The menu is essentially european, but with a healthy dose of Italian flavor. Drinks ( a martini and Jameson Irish) and appetizers (braised short ribs and seared oysters to start. Drinks were fine; appetizers were superb. The seared oysters were among the best food ever passing my lips. Entrees (scallops and lasagne) were good but not awesome. Coffee and desert - bill for two was $117.
January 23, 2016|Downtown Gem|5|Been here twice, and for good reason, the food is great, menu is varied enough for just about anybody and the atmosphere is modern and inviting. Has a terrific bar and the service is exceptional. Will be coming back!
January 21, 2016|Good Evening|4|We went early, and our table on the balcony was very nice. Ahmed was very engaged as our waiter. The grilled oysters, the cioppino, and the mocha mousse were outstanding, other dishes very good. Missed salt and pepper on the table, and bread never came, but overall a good evening.
January 18, 2016|It is a good restaurant. Food is delicio...|3|It is a good restaurant. Food is delicious. It was not too noisy since there weren't much people at the time, but since there's a bar I could see this place being very loud. Serving was.. okay- wasn't great. He forgot to bring us breads until we asked him for it and it was difficult to look for him when we needed him..
January 9, 2016|Spectacular date night|5|My wife and I went for a date night and were blown away. The ambiance was intimate and welcoming. The staff were attentive and present but not overbearing. The courses were wonderfully paced and expertly seasoned; we even experimented with and enjoyed new cuisine (who knew duck hearts were so good!) The drink selections were varied and delicious! And most unexpected, the DJ and bar area were really quite active and fun after dinner. We made a full night out of the trip out when we were only expecting a dinner. We'll be back the next chance we get. Bravo Carlo!
December 31, 2015|Very attentive service, great bar area|5|Have been to Circe multiple times and always receive great service at both the bar area and your table. Great variety of food from appetizers to desserts. The bar staff does a healthy pour and features unique potions. You won't be disappointed.
December 30, 2015|Great Service Good Food|4|The menu is awesome it's just seems like something is missing everytime I have been here. The service and staff here are awesome and very friendly the food is good just not great. I have not tried their brunch but want to.
December 26, 2015|Great spot|5|Great restaurant! Nice menu! Reservations were for 7:00 and bar & dining area were quiet. By 8:00 things were getting busy! By 10:00 the place was packed! Reminded me for a NYC or DC venue!!
December 11, 2015|great birthday dinner!|4|I took my husband here for his birthday before we attended a show at PPAC. Food was delicious, service was very good. Great martinis and pleasant atmosphere. Would definitely go back!
December 11, 2015|Consistent all the way around!|5|Circe is great for dinner before a show, a great martini or a place to celebrate. Love this spot. Great food.
December 6, 2015|Although I'm a native Bostonian, I do li...|3|Although I'm a native Bostonian, I do like Providence too! After reading great reviews, we decided to try Circe. My son is at PC and we thought we'd take him to a show at PPAC and a Christmas dinner out. Our waitress was excellent and the atmosphere was lovely...very contemporary and sheek. I ordered the special, a Scottish salmon over lobster mashed with local scallops and a tomato buerre blanc. It was so incredibly salty that I couldn't eat it! Also, the gorgeous piece of salmon was terribly overcooked as were the scallops. I didn't want to complain as my husband and son were happy with their meals, a shortrib and a lamb shank. I had my husband try my dinner and thought the same thing....Terribly disappointed considering the price tag of $36 for the dish.
November 22, 2015|Censational Circe !!!!!!|5|Friends had been the previous week for dinner and told us how GREAT the food was. So we decided to come from Ct. to meet them for brunch. I ordered pancakes and they were the BEST ever

She made great recommendations to us for food which we thoroughly enjoyed. We can't wait to go back. This place is a gem. Our only complaint was that one of the waitresses wreaked of cigarette smoke and walked by us several times right after we got our food which was a huge turn off.
November 21, 2015|Not well taken care of|1|Upon arrival we were left standing at the desk for an inordinate amount of time before being seated at a terribly exposed table near the drafty door. We informed our server that we had theater tickets, and he assured us that we had plenty of time for a leisurely meal, but the entrees took forever to arrive, leaving us less than 10 minutes to wolf down mains that should have been savored. Circe promotes their pre-theater dining, but they really fell flat this time, and I would be reluctant to trust them not to spoil another night out.
November 21, 2015|Great dining experience!|5|We came in before a show at PPAC so our reservation was early, 5:15. I had tried to make it for 6 pm for 4 people but it said it had no availability. And during our 2 hours there the place had not filled up yet. Anyway, we each had one or two appetizers, which were great and each had an entrees and split two desserts. All the food was fabulous! The only thing was our entrees did come out when we still had our appetizers, which made it seemed a bit rushed. Our server (I believe his name was Dave but not fully sure) was great! He was friendly but not obtrusive and his service was seamless. There was no valet when we arrived so we circled the block since we were unsure what was going on and when I asked to put my leftovers in the car after eating I was given my keys to do so despite the valet not having any cars to park and playing on his phone. A simple offer to do it for me would have been very hospitable. When we came back for the car there was a bit of a line so we just asked for our keys and got the car ourselves, which was no big deal.
November 7, 2015|Highly Recommend|5|It was the perfect place for a night out with friends. They offered complimentary Valet Services which was so convenient. I had the Hibiscus Martini and the Truffle Parmesan Fries and both were amazing in taste and presentation. Shawn was our server and was really attentive and was very personable.
November 6, 2015|Usually Amazing Service|3|"We love this restaurant . Had a glitch with service on our last visit. The hostess sat us at a corner table in the back...best table. It is! But, the wait staff did not know who was assigned to the table. Would suggest that staff ask, ""have you been....?"" We will be back for the exceptional menu. If ignored... ??"

October 31, 2015|Circe is enchanting.|5|Great location, inventive menu, knowledgeable staff and a good wine list. What more can you ask for? Go for the food, sit at the beautiful bar, be enchanted.

October 21, 2015|Fun food and ambience!|5|Thankful downtown Providence has Circe!! Great for locals and visitors - place to be!
October 17, 2015|Great experience|5|Even though I am temporarily on a restricted diet, the food was great. I can't wait to get back when I have full culinary freedom!

Dined on October 12, 2015|pleasant|4|Food was good, service was good, located near ppac so it is perfect for a 'dinner and a show' night out.
October 10, 2015|Gnudi|5|The gnudi was unique and delicious--I am a fan of gnocchi but had never heard of gnudi (which is ricotta-based rather than potato-based).
October 8, 2015|Fantastic experience|5|Overall great experience! Server was very friendly and informative and the food was amazing
October 3, 2015|Consistently Good Restaurant|4|We returned to Circe after a very good previous experience and were not disappointed. Our waiter was very attentive and pleasant to talk to. He was able to answer our questions regarding the food and wine and had good suggestions for indecisive members of our party. Everyone's food was very good and the portions sizes were about right for everyone which left us room for desert. The tables were a bit close together but adjacent diners were not intrusive. The only minor disappointment was the coffee which was not up to standard (old and cold!).
October 3, 2015|Good Food, and an Accommodating Chef|5|We were in downtown Providence looking for a place to eat on a Saturday night waiting for water fire to start, and discovered Circe via TripAdvisor. Since we eat paleo, we weren't sure how willing they would be to adapt their standard offerings. But, to our delight, they did. The swordfish was served with no cous cous (plus crab and calamari) in a wheatless bouilliabaise, and my wife's scallops were served with roasted cauliflower instead of pureed with butter plus zucchini spaghetti. Everything was delicious. The service was impeccable (thank you, Sean), and the atmosphere outstanding. Highly recommend.
October 2, 2015|Great 1st time expience|4|The appetizers, main course and attention from everyone was great. Found this on Open Table and will be back
September 26, 2015|Delicious food|4|Tries a little too hard to be hip, but an overall good dining experience.
September 20, 2015|A peasant surprise very close to PPAC.  loved it!|5|Food, service, owner, delicious, gracious, humble. Great food, desserts and drinks. Knowledge of all things restaurant!
September 19, 2015|Food and Service was great!|5|A friend recommended Circe and very glad we tried the restaurant. Love the ambiance, food and the service! We were also surprised to receive a discount because we were attending an event at PPAC. The owner was right there serving the patrons! Don't usually see that in a restaurant. We will definitely return!
September 15, 2015|delicious food|4|The food was absolutely delicious. The service could have been better. Had to ask twice for bread. Then we had no bread plates. We told them when we first sat down that we were going to the theater, yet our entrees took quite a while. BUT every meal was fabulous.
September 12, 2015|If your looking for great food, service ...|4|If your looking for great food, service and atmosphere. This place has it. Outstanding food and the staff was great.
September 12, 2015|Was just ok|3|My husband and I went here for my birthday based upon the reviews, and it was just ok. The restaurant has a modern, all white vibe. Our server was fine, but the food was just ok. Ordered the grilled oysters and stuffed artichoke and neither were noteworthy. I order the sea scallops which was good (best part of the dinner), but my husbands lobster gnocchi was under seasoned and underwhelming. We have 2 kids and don't get out all that often and overall we were disappointed. With so many great restaurants - we felt bummed we didn't go someplace else.
September 12, 2015|Another fantastic meal.|5|This place is never a disappointment. By far the best food I've had eating out. Going here is more than dinner, its an experience. Carlo, the owner, visits with everyone and is the most gracious host I have met. The servers and other staff are outstanding as well. And the food. wow. Their chefs create magic in the kitchen. Highly recommend the lobster risotto with the avocado ice cream (sounds crazy but its amazing).
September 6, 2015|pretty|4|pretty restaurant; nice staff; great food. we were there for brunch. delicious eclectic menu. nice spot.
August 30, 2015|Circe: Excellent Food Matched by Excellent Service|5|Tried this restaurant for lunch for the first week during the 2015 Providence Restaurant Weeks in July. I was impressed enough to bring my husband there for his birthday dinner. Circe did not disappoint on this special occasion. The menu is innovative, and my husband and I enjoyed first-rate meals. We will definitely return.
August 29, 2015|Excellent|5|We went here on a Saturday night with another couple and we all had a good experience. The food was excellent, service was very good and friendly and the drinks were great too. We would definitely return. FYI, the bar is open late(2AM) and there was a DJ playing(started around 10).
August 29, 2015|Wonderful  dinner experience at Circe!|5|The food was amazing and the service - impeccable. I ordered salmon with sautéed spinach as a side. It was a generous portion and cooked to perfection. Two of my dinner guests ordered the chicken and meatloaf and they raved about both dishes. Again, the portions were generous and beautifully presented. Our server, Ahmed, was pleasant, attentive and efficient. Would highly recommend Circe. You will not be disappointed!
August 28, 2015|Fantastic Evening Once Again!|5|"Many times have dined at Circe and this evening was no exception! Carlo and his staff treat you as if you are only ones dining in this restaurant. The service and hospitality are outstanding. Carlo even works hard at remembering frequent guests and it is so refreshing to find a dining establishment that really cares about its clients. It is easy to become a ""regular"" here. From the craft cocktails to the charcuterie board to the excellent entrees Circe is a can't miss! Very lucky to have found such great restauranting gem in Providence. Thanks again for a great meal Circe!"
August 23, 2015|What a find!|5|My husband and I recently came across Circe on OpenTables and decided to give a go for our one year anniversary. Although the restaurant was pretty quiet (it was a Sunday night), we received such amazing attention from our waitress and the owner(?) who came to chat with us about the menu and restaurant. Food and drinks were equally delicious (especially the homemade pappardelle pasta - wild boar and seafood) and we will definitely be coming back!
August 23, 2015|Quiet Sunday Evening in August|5|The service was outstanding - friendly, helpful and efficient. The food was very good to excellent, and certainly interesting, marking a departure from expectations. The grilled oysters were sumptuous; the Angus filet savory and perfectly cooked; and a vegetarian menu of beet salad, gnocchi and arugula salad was stimulating and very filling. Would definitely repeat and recommend.
July 31, 2015|wait and beg....|3|The food was absolutely good, but the service was awful. We had to wait, standing ignored for table tho we had reservations, and had called to confirm. the maitre'd did apologize, but then we were ignored again. At every turn we had to wait and flag down someone for attention. There were two big parties at the same time, but by 10, the restaurant was quieter and we still had to beg.
July 31, 2015|Good food, good ambiance, took 10 min to...|3|Good food, good ambiance, took 10 min to get seated at a table that was open the entire time we waited, took almost 90 min to get our food and had to ask multiple times for refills on drinks.

They also played music that was more suited to a club than for an expensive dining experience. Strange. First time and unfortunately last time."
July 17, 2015|Dinner in Providence|5|We really enjoyed having dinner here. We were staying in Providence for one night on the way back to New York, and we had such a great time! Everyone was so nice and attentive and seemed to be enjoying themselves and it trickled back down to the customer. I had the Salmon and my husband had the Gnocchi and both dishes were good. It was Restaurant Week and that menu looked excellent but we decided not to do the restaurant week as some of the things we wanted were not on the Restaurant Week menu. We had a bottle of wine which was good as well and moderately priced. If we are ever in Providence, I would definitely come back here for dinner!

Yummy lamb balls as a small plate and Braised Short Rib dinner or salmon a good choice. Try this place - busy on a weekday evening too.

June 14, 2015|Brunch|4|The good:Food was excellent. Wait staff very nice. The not so good: Delivery of food was a little slow, especially for being one of the first to arrive upon opening. After using my knife for the first course, I was asked if I wanted to keep it. For a rather upscale restaurant, would expect new silverware. Also, asked for OJ and received bottled-not close to fresh. Again this was my expectation for this type of restaurant. Would I try it again-yes but would not go out of my way. Would I recommend it-yes. Perhaps it was an off day but one would expect more attention to detail
June 12, 2015|Great overall experience!|5|We love this restaurant before going to the theater. Service is attentive and friendly. A great spot to return after the show to finish the evening with a cocktail and/or dessert.
June 12, 2015|GREAT|5|Four of us were going to P-Pac Ordered cocktails were served right away our host took our orders and we were servered making it to the show in more than enough time We have been there several times plan on going again Check it out
June 11, 2015|Didn't wow me|3|I know this may sound a little crazy but I was really expecting to be wowed at this restaurant. The atmosphere was nice the service was good and the food was OK. The menu was small which is very nice but not very adventurous. I had the Angus burger and my wife had the meatloaf. Besides the portions being too large the food was just Ok. I would think with a small menu the food should have been great. With a little creativity on the part over Circe this could be a fine food restaurant.
May 24, 2015|graduation dinner|5|We took our son for his Brown postgraduation dinner to Circe. The atmosphere was nice, the staff was very attentive, the food was great and the Death by chocolate dessert didn' t disappoint!
May 20, 2015|What a great time!|5|Had an unplanned dinner at Circe just to unwind and get over some difficult meetings during the day. What a fantastic choice in which to experience great cuisine, terrific hospitality, and a generous welcome and care! From the moment my companion and I entered Circe we were greeted with a friendliness and warmth that was very helpful. Our waiter Sean was excellent -- giving us enough time to peruse the menu and have a cocktail. The Kitchen demonstrated their talents superbly and the short rib and tuna special we had could not have been more delicious! Beginning with a charcuterie board is always a good decision. Even having Carlo, the owner, stop by our table to check on us was a very kind and made us feel even more at home. Thank you once again Circe for out-doing yourself!
April 23, 2015|Pre PPAC Dinner|5|"Prior to going to PPAC for an evening performance, we always dine at a different venue. ""Circe Restaurant"" was just enjoyable in every category. I would recommend it to anyone."
April 19, 2015|Like Eating Leftovers|2|"The major problem with our dinner at Circe was the service. We had ordered three courses, and we specifically asked our server to time the arrival of each course so that we did not have to rush through any one of the dishes. We asked for a shared appetizer with our cocktails. The appetizer arrived within minutes and, since it was a hot appetizer, one would expect the cocktail to arrive first or at the same time as the appetizer. Unfortunately, the cocktails arrived ten minutes later. Seemed like an inordinate amount of time to wait for a simple martini and one of the restaurant's specialty cocktails, considering that there were only two other parties in the restaurant at the time. The salads arrived before we could finish our cocktails. At that time, we once again reminded our server that the pace seemed a bit rushed and that we wanted to take our time. She assured us that she would not put in the order for the main course until we finished our salads. About two minutes later, two plates that looked exactly like our order appeared on the counter under the warming lights of the open kitchen. The plates sat there for the entire time we were eating our salads. Much discussion ensued between the chef and the manager while the plates remained under the warming lights. The server then came to our table and asked if we wanted her to put in our order. It took every bit of willpower not to say, ""Why don't you just bring them over from under the warming lights?"" Needless to say, those were our dinners and they arrived lukewarm and tasted like leftovers. Clearly this restaurant needs to treat its patrons a bit more honestly. Any self-respecting chef would have thrown those dishes out after sitting on the counter for 15 minutes or more, and made new dishes. There are too many fine restaurants in Providence - no need to pay dearly for poor service and ""leftovers."""

March 15, 2015|Disappointing brunch|3|"Went there with my wife for brunch on a Saturday. Having passed by the restaurant a number of times we both thought it looked like a nice place and the menu sold us on giving it a try. However, the food did not live up to the impression given by the location, menu etc. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. I had an omelette, which was ok, and my wife had the ""Carlo's way"", causing her to be quite disappointed. The poached eggs were not done right, one well over-cooked and the other under-cooked, and the dish didn't seem like a cohesive thing as much as a couple of different things put on the same plate. I don't know if this was an off day or if we just had completely the wrong expectation but we left with the feeling that we would have done a better job preparing the same kind of food at home. Still, I like the place and will give it another try for dinner. The complaint is only on the food as the staff was nice and welcoming, the service not lacking at all."
March 4, 2015|Terrific Downcity Eaterie|5|Food and service both excellent. Very attractive spot with interesting menu choices and great execution. Very good pretheatre service despite huge crowd.
March 4, 2015|Hip, high-quality pre-event dining.|4|Hip spot in heart of Providence. Walking distance to hotels and Providence Performing Arts Center. Balcony window seating provides cool overview of bar below and vibrant street scene. Diverse menu, duck was excellent. One annoyance: While our server was charming, he was EXTREMELY slow (or just overworked) with our drink order and didn't bring bread until we asked - it came 30 seconds before the meal arrived. Could be due to fact that servers have to climb stairs to reach balcony seating - it must be a workout, but others who sat after us had their drinks and bread well before us.
February 20, 2015|Delaih|4|Went for a dinner date with the man. We got the burrata and the scallop ceviche as appetizers. The burrata was delicious definitely recommend it. The ceviche not so much sent it back very fishy tasting. For dinner he ordered the bacon wrapped tenderloin and it was delicious, cooked perfectly. I ordered the gnocchi and it was very good. All in all the restaurant was excellent and we will be going back.
Dined on January 24, 2015|poor taste|2|There was nothing dramatically wrong with Circe. But there wasn't a lot right with it either. The beef tenderloin was fantastic. Other than that, our experience was disappointing. We arrived at a 6:00 Friday night reservation at 6:00, which seemed to fluster the receptionist, as it took her 5 min to seat us in the near empty restaurant. We were seated at the top of the stairs, so whenever waiters moved around they would bump the back of my chair. The chairs look like they were all made out of an NCYNC jacket. They photograph beautifully, but it's hard not to chuckle at the early 2000s styling for a restaurant that is less than 5-years old. The EDM confirmed that the place can't decide if it wants to be an elegant space or a bro-club. My fig manhattan came in a brandy glass, which seems like a good idea, but isn't. Or maybe I'm placing too much blame on the glass, as the drink tasted of old vermouth and not much else, and bartender missed an ice cube when he was straining it. The lobster bisque and the spring rolls were fine; the Wild Mushroom Bolognese has amazing hand cut fettucine that must have exhausted the kitchen because the truffles and the parmesan did almost nothing for the dish. The Chocolate 3 ways was a nice desert, much better than the apple & blackberry polenta crisp.
January 17, 2015|Nice place, but we had a long wait to be...|4|Nice place, but we had a long wait to be seated even though we had a reservation and there were many empty tables. The manager quickly made up for that with free drinks! My only complaint is for the architect: he/she should have thought about the placement of the front door since every time the door opened we got a blast of artic cold. Beside being chilly, everything else was wonderful; the food was great!
January 17, 2015|Wonderful Food and Service|5|We were there as a couple on a Saturday night before a PPAC show. It is just a short walk away from the PPAC and the restaurant offers free valet parking - car can be picked up after the show. We happened to dine during restaurant week, although that was not planned. The offerings for restaurant week were fabulous. Every course was delicious and memorable. I had the lobster bisque which was very light and delicious. Main course was the bacon wrapped tenderloin, cooked perfectly and also delicious. Dessert was a white chocolate pumpkin creme brûlée with caramel popcorn - fabulous. I have to mention the most delicious martini every - the Hibiscus Martini topped with an edible orchid. Drink was light and delicious, not to mention beautiful to look at. What really made everything perfect was our excellent service. Katie was so attentive and allowed us to linger with each course. We never felt rushed and had a delightful experience. Will go back again and again!
January 16, 2015|disappointed|1|Food was so-so, service was slow and atmosphere loud. Would advise checking bill when presented, may have been because of restaurant week with staff looking for tips, with automated system these billing errors don't happen by accident. Many other great restaurants in Providence, will not be back.
January 10, 2015|GO THERE YOU MUST NOT MISS OUT ON THIS GEM|5|"I love the relaxed feel of this place I definitely would return to try more dishes. Service was well-timed and friendly."""
December 31, 2014|New in Providence|4|Nice addition to Providence. Interesting menu. Upscale decor and dining. A little rushed on NYE but I guess that is to be expected. Has the nice feel of a big city restaurant.
December 28, 2014|great surprise|5|we were looking for a brunch in Providence.....Circe was perfect. Service was exceptional. Food was great. I had the chicken and waffles which has become a favorite of mine since I moved to FL. but hadn't tried it in RI. Would highly recommend Circe. They offer unlimited mimosas for $20.
December 13, 2014|Wonderful start to finish.  Great drinks...|5|Wonderful start to finish. Great drinks, apps, dinner and desert. Excellent service and atmosphere. Can't wait to have dinner there again
November 7, 2014|Great dining experience!|5|Amazing food, the drinks were out of this world, and the wait staff were friendly and attentive.
November 7, 2014|Modern chic|5|The white leather bar stools and chic environment is inviting. The presentation of the food is the focus. Delicious! I can't wait for my next visit for brunch or before the theater.
October 23, 2014|I found a Gem|5|Literally stumbled upon Circe one day last year & simple sat at the bar the first time. It has become my favorite Providence Eatery
October 21, 2014|Tony from Bristol|5|Our dining experience at Circe was a delight. It was my birthday and we wanted the night to be special. We were seated in a romantic corner and enjoyed both the fine food and the privacy. I enjoyed the muscles starter and the one pound pork chop and my wife felt the same about the Beet salad and the Salmon on the menu. I encourage you to be a diner at this lovely restaurant.
October 17, 2014|excellent location, but that's it|3|I love an energetic spot, and will gladly pay for an excellent meal, but this place was lacking. It wasn't energetic, it was just plain loud. I was sitting directly across from my husband and could hardly hear him. The food was just okay, but the prices were outrageous. I don't mind paying prices that high, but the food has to wow me. In this case the food just made me meh. I'm glad we tried it, but I won't be going back.
October 12, 2014|Disappointed|2|The food was very good. The service was not and it colored the whole evening a dreary shade of gray, much like the decor. We dined there on a Sunday night. The place was not packed but they led us past empty tables to the back corner next to the service area with a lovely view of a dismal section of the kitchen. This location, however, did not guarantee us service. I do not know what the waitress was doing but it was not serving us. I expect to be treated as a valued customer I was not. The water/bus boy was the only one to pay any attention to our needs. With so many wonderful restaurants to choose from there is no need for us to return here.
October 11, 2014|Great Find|5|My wife and I were looking for a nice restaurant to try and found this Gem on open table. Food is awesome. I had the lamb. My wife had the lobster risotto (appetizer) and the chicken for dinner. Both were exceptional. The music was nice but not loud. The noise level was dinner appropriate where my wife and I could hear each other but didn't feel like a library. Patrons were well dressed. Staff was very nice and helpful. Great place.
October 4, 2014|Good Choice|4|Everything was top quality except the service was marginal at best. We spoke to the owners who were friendly and showed interest. Good location and a nice ambiance with recent improvements to the decor that were beneficial.
October 3, 2014|Service was excellent.  Calamari was exc...|4|Service was excellent. Calamari was excellent.The sole special was delectable and my husband loved his seared ahi tuna.
September 30, 2014|Birthday dinner|5|Found this online of a review of restaurants in Providence. I was looking for a new place to celebrate my husband's 60th b'day. This was a restaurant we had never been to before and were very pleased. The service was wonderful, the food outstanding and the atmosphere was great! Highly recommend!!!
September 27, 2014|Excellent!|5|There was a group of four of us, we started with our excellent waitress Kate who was an absolute pleasure. The menu had enough choices without being bogged down. Two of us had the Scottish salmon, one had the salmon with scallops special and another veal and pasta. The salmon was huge, you ordered your sides separate. We all cleaned our plates..the food, service and ambiance was absolutely excellent. I visit a lot if the PVD restaurants and have to say they after this experience I cannot wait to go back..this is my new favorite restaurant..did I say I cannot wait to go back...excellent chef!
September 27, 2014|cals|5|Excellent food, great wine & wonderful service ! Hope to return real soon
September 20, 2014|Amazing! Highly recommend.|5|We ate dinner there this past Friday night and the food was amazing. This was our first time eating here so we really didn't know what to expect. Everything was extremely fresh and the Chef did a great job with flavor combinations. My son started off with a lobster risotto which was delicious and then he had the duck which he said was really good and before I got to try it, it was all gone. My husband had a caesar salad to start and then the Veal bolognese. Yum. And I had a few different apps. All very good. We were so full we couldn't even have dessert. Which was a shame because the list looked incredible. I would definitely go back. All 3 of us were really pleased.
September 12, 2014|Fabulous food|5|Dinner here was wonderful! Food was delicious. Carlo the owner came by to our table at least 3 times to check on our experience. I have already recommended this restaurant to friends. I can't wait to come back!
September 5, 2014|Fantastic|5|I brought my best friend for her birthday, and while the other two guests did not show up, the service was great and the waitstaff was amazing.They treated us perfect for her birthday and were so kind and patient with the situation. The food was phenomenal and it ended up being a relaxing birthday night. I can't wait to come back.
August 31, 2014|Great food and drinks!|5|We really enjoyed our dinner here. The food was interesting and delicious. And the special drinks quite fun. Our only complaint is the noise level, a bit loud even when mostly empty. They did their best to find us a quieter table.
August 22, 2014|another excellent meal|5|Dinner for five. all courses, wine and service were top notch. the pasta dishes and seafood were exceptional. Owner is attentive and incorporates feedback productively. it is closer than you realize and has free valet parking. check it out.
August 20, 2014|Pre-theater|5|Great place to eat before the theater.. Or second thought.. Eat there anytime ..
August 16, 2014|Great place to celebrate|5|Went out with a group of 4 people to celebrate friends moving into the area. Service was excellent, cocktail and wine list was fun, the menu options were superb. It was difficult to pick among the options, but everyone was happy with their choice. And the dessert was the perfect end to the evening. We felt well cared for the entire time.
August 10, 2014|Great birthday celebration!|4|Fantastic food and cocktail selection! Quiet on a Sunday night. Great dessert presentation for a special occasion! Service was outstanding!
August 9, 2014|Five star dining|5|A five star hidden gem. The best restaurant in any country I have ever visited is Circe. The food is so memorable that you will never go anywhere else again. The bar is a delight to the senses. The attention to detail and romantic atmosphere is intoxicating. The staff is knowledgable and attentive to your every need. The sights, sounds and artistic tones will leave you wanting more. This is something you just have to experience.
August 9, 2014|Incredible food and great service!|5|We live north of Boston so we don't get to Providence very often, but we had such a nice evening at Circe that we have to share. Four exceptional meals were delivered to our table last Saturday night, and we truly appreciated our server; Dave. He did an outstanding job and made us feel like we were his only table. It was a fun-filled, delicious, unhurried dining experience, and one we will remember for a long time. Well done!
July 27, 2014|We found this restaurant through Open Ta...|5|We found this restaurant through Open Table. We were in Providence and stopped for brunch. It is definitely five stars. The restaurant is beautiful and the service and food were over the top. We had omelettes, caprese salad, Jonah crab hash and another breakfast egg dish. All were wonderful.
July 26, 2014|A Find!|5|"We took a risk going to Circe, knowing nothing about it other than what we read on line, and we were taking out-of-town guests. So we were thrilled to find another restaurant to add to our ""Must go back"" list. The service was outstanding. Our waitress was enthusiastic, helpful, and attentive, as were the young men who assisted her. The cocktails were unparalleled. Carlo's special recipes were like nothing we'd ever tasted. We were particularly fond of the Whole Foods cocktail and Hibiscus martini. We started with the calamari, lightly breaded, done to perfection. Two of us had the scallops which were delicate and perfectly prepared. The salmon was also lovely. The meal ended with lemon tart and white chocolate crème brule. Wonderful."
July 24, 2014|Hidden Gem|5|My wife and I wanted to try a new place and we found some great review about Circe... which caused some shock when we arrived, because it was relatively empty. The bar was almost full with seemingly a post-work (Thursday) cocktail crowd, but only one or two other tables with guests dining. The service was fantastic, the food was delicious. The only reason it marked a 4/5 stars was that I wasn't a fan of the spices in the meatball appetizer -- but my wife was the one who ordered it, and she loved it. We had the grilled pizza and beef tartar, which were both phenomenal. The owner even stopped by to check on us and showed a clear passion for his restaurant, which is always refreshing. I hope more people start going!
July 18, 2014|Nice mod look with strikingly upholstere...|4|"Nice mod look with strikingly upholstered chairs, a nice buzz in the atmosphere. Good drinks and an exciting wine list, the all-Spanish theme is bold and there are some real bargains (e.g Mas Donis and some Bierzo selections as well as Lopez de Haro Rioja, all Parker 90+ wines in the $20's and low 30""s!!!) Very nice selection of tapas well prepared, some dishes genuinely exciting (Chilean Sea Bass Cheeks over lobster succotash was superb) and others standard issue (Gambas al Ajo would have been nicer crisped up in shell especially with heads on) ....overall a winner and will definitely return"
July 17, 2014|Eh|3|The restaurant is beautiful but the food was just ok. Everything we ordered was cooked well but it all lacked flavor. Nothing tasted bad, just didn't make me want to come back. It was Restaurant Week so not sure if that was a factor.
July 17, 2014|Awesome Bar Staff|5|Had a great time at the bar. Bartenders were friendly and made some amazing drinks. Great bar menu as well. Overall a great night!
July 16, 2014|Deborah Moxham|5|Circe has a striking space with dramatic high ceilings, a clean white look, and a happening bar. It offers plenty of seating, including a balcony which overlooks it all but affords a quieter space. The menu is full of appealing options and the food is stellar. Everyone at my table of six though this own dish was the best, from the fried oysters to the watermelon gaspzpacho , the range of appetizers was notable. My cider brined pork chop with chutney and a sage cream sauce was a knockout. I would go back for this dish alone. Desserts were equally scrumptious. To add to all this, our waitress was perfect with service and recommendations on food and wine and got the cocktail orders just right.
July 14, 2014|Not a good experience|2|I came to Circe with 3 others to enjoy the food of Restaurant week. We were seated right away and introduced to our server, Kevin. However the prompt service vanished as soon as it was apparent that we weren't ordering any alcohol and were using the restaurant week menu. From then on Kevin barely came to our table. It took 40 minutes for BREAD to be served after having to ask again for it. It took one hour to get our appetizers and the restaurant wasn't even crowded! As for the food, the pasta dish was inedible with the hand-cut pasta too doughy and a disconcertingly oily sauce. The English Summer pudding was fairly bad - the fruit didn't taste fresh. Overall the service and wait times were terrible and accompanied by equally bad dishes.
July 12, 2014|Are there 6 STARS? FABULOUS!|5|We booked this GEM for dinner and all 4 of us can't stop talking about it. Creative cocktails received rave reviews. Unique appetizers ranging from watermelon gazpacho, or roasted beet salad made the best of local farm fresh produce. You could taste the summer sunshine! The entree's were 10+. PERFECT angus sirloin and scallop dish, served with sautéed spinach and scallion mashed potatoes. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the beef is sliced and fanned out on your plate so that a knife really isn't necessary. A very flavorful and most tender cut. Perfect presentation! Great service! Beautiful transitional interior with respect for the architectural details of the building. Fine dinning at its BEST!
July 11, 2014|Excellent drinks and food!|4|They have the best cocktail menu in providence. I love the age range of the crowd ( 30-50) The food was excellent. The owner treated us very nicely! Thank you for a wonderful date night:)
Dined on July 5, 2014|Absolutely wonderful!|5|Great food, extremely attentive service, great wine list, cool atmosphere -what more could you ask for?
July 4, 2014|Excellent again|5|Had another excellent dinner at Circe! The food was top notch as well as everything else. Specialty cocktails that delivered, creative and well executed menu, great atmosphere and service. What more could one ask for? Circe tries hard to please and succeeds. I will definitely go back!
July 3, 2014|Exceeded expectations|4|Pleasantly surprised, met and exceeded my expectations. Great food, friendly staff, and nice ambience. Definitely a place I plan to visit again.
June 15, 2014|???|1|This was my second time having dinner at Circe; the first time was a Saturday night, the restaurant was very busy, the food was very good and there was valet parking. The reviews stated customers attending PPAC were given theater discounts and were able to keep their cars valet parked at the restaurant; having theater tickets for this past Sunday night we decided to have dinner again at Circe. It was like a different restaurant, no valet parking, although we were allowed to park in the parking lot across the street, the restaurant had very few customers, the food lacked flavor, and we were not offered a theater discount. With so many good restaurants in Providence to choose from, I will not be having dinner at Circe again.
June 14, 2014|Perfect!|5|Service, atmosphere and food were all perfect! Great location if you are going to Waterfire.
May 30, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|This was a perfect place for our anniversary. Free valet, great cocktail list, and a very energetic, attentive and friendly server. (wish I remembered her name). We had lamb meatballs for an appetizer, the bacon wrapped sirloin, and salmon. All were fantastic. I have recommended this place to friends.
May 25, 2014|Lovely graduation dinner|5|In spite of the challenge of dealing with several large groups celebrating local college graduations, the team at Circe made our evening memorably pleasant. Our server was very knowledgeable and spent a lot of time explaining menu items and specials. We started with local cheeses paired with a bottle from the very good wine list, and our party ordered a variety of entrees, giving us a good cross section of the menu. The salmon with mango salsa was the best salmon dish I've had in a long time. We did lose our server halfway through the meal, as he was apparently pulled away by a party of 12+ in the back of the restaurant, but that small glitch in service in no way compromised the fine overall experience.
May 25, 2014|Perfect dinner celebration!|5|We went to Circe for a special graduation dinner --- and it could not have been more perfect! The staff went out of their way to take care of our large party (including making a couple of special plates for some family members with dietary restrictions) and every dish was absolutely delicious. Everybody raved about their meals (and this is a crowd that frequents restaurants in NY, Boston, etc.) The evening was paced just right. We absolutely loved Circe and will be back--a real find!
May 24, 2014|Great value|4|We were a party of four on a very busy Providence Waterfire night. Our table was ready, service was timely, our waiter was experienced and knowledgeable, and the food was very good as expected. What is truly appreciated at this restaurant is the scale. The noise level is moderate and the tables are nicely spaced. The cost was less than what we expected to pay.
May 24, 2014|commencement celebration|5|We had a dinner celebrating college graduation. The reserved table for our group was in the front window alcove which was nice for quiet conversation and very comfortable. The noise level in other parts of the restaurant may get to be rather high, given the active bar clientele, but it did not disturb our group. Service was attentive and the food was outstanding, with beautiful presentation.
May 21, 2014|Beattraffic/Go to theatre/Anytime|4|"This is the second time dining here and it was as good as the first. My husband and I chose to do small plates for dinner and order in ""courses"", from the bar menu, to enjoy the flavors - chicken fingers fried in bacon/bacon fat with a chipotle dipping sauce, duck confit eggrolls with a hoisin peanut butter dipping sauce; split the meatloaf; each had the Caesar salad (request all romaine and beets on mine. Everything was prepared, presented and served wonderfully. The first visit was before the theater and had plenty of time to dine and arrive on time. This time it was to wait out rush hour traffic back to Mass. It was a very pleasant way to wait out the traffic. The staff and owner are very welcoming."
May 10, 2014|"Circe=Greek for ""Great restaurant""?"|5|"This restaurant has it all...inventive dishes perfectly executed with local ingredients, excellent service, cool vibe, and very convenient to other downtown Providence sites, including PPAC and Waterfire. Pricey but well worth the cost. We had tickets to PPAC and received the ""pre-theater"" discount, courtesy of our server. Standout dishes included the salads with Shartner's Farm beets, mushroom bolognese (vegetarian), lobster risotto, and grilled Bomster scallops. The french fries with the garlic aoli dipping sauce were a hit, too (we wouldn't let our server take away the sauce after the fries were long gone). No time for dessert this visit, but we'll definitely be back. Highly recommended. Interesting fact: ""Circe"" is pronounced ""sur-see""."
May 10, 2014|interesting fresh menu|4|The decor of the restaurant was great. It was comfortable and modern. The menu was interesting with many local ingredients. The lobster risotto with avocado ice cream was outstanding. We loved the trout stuffed with crabmeat special as well. It was a wonderful start to a fun evening at the theater. The complimentary valet parking was a nice bonus.
May 10, 2014|Exquisite!|5|I am so glad we tried Circe! It was within walking distance from the PPAC, which is perfect for before or after a show. Their 3-course Prix Fixe menu offered enough variety to suit all four at our table, and everything was delicious! To highlight a few items: the calamari was light, tender and crispy; the truffle-infused bolognese was packed with rich flavor; the salmon was cooked to perfection, accompanied by the freshest mango salsa. The service was prompt and courteous. We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Providence!
May 9, 2014|Great any time!|4|We first had a family dinner last December at Circe before going to PPAC. The food was fabulous, the atmosphere lively with a long crowded bar, they offer valet parking, and after dinner, we walked to PPAC since Circe allows theater goers to leave their cars with the valet! This is a real find for folks with tickets to the Providence Performing Arts Center. We returned to Circe for Mother's Day. Again, the hostess was extremely accomodating, and the food delicious. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because the table configuration is somewhat limited; however, they do a great job with the decor and the space they have!
May 9, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|We had dinner at Circe before a show at PPAC. The Food was wonderful. The wait staff was very attentive, and knowledgeable. I would definately return, and recommend Circe to friends
May 4, 2014|More a bar than a restaurant|2|We went after the theater around 9 pm on a Sunday. If you like pounding house music, this is the place for you. We were seated as far from the bar as possible and still couldn't hear each other. First two choices of appetizers were not available. Finally found some things on the menu that they actually had. Very mediocre food. The sashimi small plate was particularly uninspired, slices of raw fish (which were fresh) served with three accompaniments, one of which was just a bowl of capers. I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner, but the bar seems popular.
May 4, 2014|Excellent food|5|In a city where the restaurant norm would equal greatness in most of the rest of the country, based on our single experience Circe would stand out as one of the best. The food was creatively conceived and artfully prepared from excellent ingredients. We'll be back.
May 3, 2014|Disappointed|2|I chose this restaurant as we had theatre tickets and they were located close to the venue. We were promptly seated and our waiter asked if we were going to the theatre, obviously concerned about timing. We had an hour to dine. I ordered Jonnie Walker scotch and was told they were out-a red flag, how can a restaurant be out on a Saturday night. The appetizer was served promptly but dinner was not brought out to us until we questioned the waiter and ultimately had less than 10 minutes to gulp it down and ended up being late for the show. On my way out I tried to grab the manager to discuss the matter but he was already engaged with another unhappy theatre goer.
May 2, 2014|Just what Providence needed|4|Great location and ambiance. Very chic restaurant with a lively bar. Service was great. Food was excellent...however, the lamb meatballs we ordered for an app were undercooked. Our entrees were cooked to order perfectly. They went out of their way to address my food allergy and took the necessary precautions to make me feel at ease. Not to mention the 10% off for attending before the theater was an added bonus. We can't wait to go back!
May 1, 2014|Good food, disappointed by service |1|We loved our appetizer and cocktails, but were disappointed because our entrees took and hour and 15 mins to come out. We were heading to a show at PPac that night so had to have our food boxed up without even getting to enjoy a bite of it. The reheated leftovers the next day were not nearly as good as they would have been of they were fresh. I usually don't complain, but it was extremely disappointing to wait all that time and not even enjoy the food...
April 29, 2014|Great Business Lunch|5|Hosted a business lunch for 6. Service was fantastic, food was fantastic, price was reasonable. I will go back.
April 26, 2014|Dinner out with Colleagues|5|I was in town for a conference and went to dinner with some close colleagues. Dinner was wonderful! The best meal all week. The service was wonderful. I had the lamb and it was some of the best lamb I've ever had. The chocolate by death was wonderful but so large! The portions could be scaled back -- but that was true for ever restaurant I visited in Providence.
April 21, 2014|Spectacular Dining Experience!!|5|Took eight members of our staff to dinner at Circe on Monday evening. A fantastic experience all around! Our server Amy was most gracious and hospitable, making us feel not only welcome but at home and special. The food was one terrific experience after another and the ambiance and setting perfect for our celebration. Circe is a wonderful gem of a dining establishment in downtown Providence and a superb addition to my group's list of culinary exceptional finds! Thank you to the staff and chefs at Circe for a memorable evening!
April 20, 2014|First time at a Circe Brunch|5|We ate brunch on Easter Sunday, and had tickets to the performance @ PPAC. Everything was very good. The food was delicious, and came out promptly. Our server was attentive, and professional. I would definitely recommend Circe to anyone, and look forward to returning.
April 12, 2014|Great location for before|5|Great location for before or after theater. Wait staff very attentive & knowlegable.
April 1, 2014|Excellent|5|Our favorite restaurant. Great drinks, food, and atmosphere.
March 15, 2014|Great food, awesome servers!|4|Three of us had dinner at Circe recently and the whole experience was great. It is slightly pricey but you absolutely get what you pay for! All of our drinks were just the right combination of tasty and strong. The hibiscus martini was incredible. The servers and owner were always available but never intrusive. They truly seemed to care how everything was and appreciated the feedback. We will definitely go there again!!
March 15, 2014|Providence rocks again|5|One of the best dining experiences ive had in a long time. Great vibe, service and food.
March 8, 2014|Late Night Dining Surprise|4|I checked with OpenTable for late night dining downtown and found Circe Restaurant. Great find! The service from Kavon and David was great. Everyone there was so accommodating. The decor is fabulous.And the food was quite tasty for everyone in our group. I had the lobster risotto and it was mouth watering. If you love chocolate, do leave without getting Death By Chocolate....to die for...for sure!
March 8, 2014|Great place for a pre-show dinner|5|My friend and I chose Circe for dinner before a show in the city. We found the food to be delicious, service attentive and pleasant, and the ambience, lovely. We split the beet salad for an appetizer, and it was refreshing, delicate and delicious. I had the surf and turf special which consisted of thinly sliced scallops and beef tenderloin medallions, over a bed of spinach, over lobster risotto. My friend wanted the same dish, minus the beef, so the chef substituted with more scallops. Both of our meals were delicious. We split the espresso creme brulee for dessert. It was perfect. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience and will definitely come back again.
March 1, 2014|Hot Spot Downcity|4|It's great to see Circe attract a great and diverse crowd to its stunning restaurant. The chef has crafted an impressive menu, augmented by interesting specials, that will appeal to almost any pallet. The service was superb and conscientious. Our meals were tasty, well plated, and served properly, although two guests felt theirs was salty. Overall, a wonderful, hip destination for a fun, special or romantic night out.
March 1, 2014|Great Service!!|3|The service was impeccable and the restaurant itself is beautiful. The owner took the time to chat with us following our meal which left us with a very good impression. We plan to return in the future.
February 23, 2014|I love this restaurant, the|5|I love this restaurant, the tomato Florentine on the brunch menu was delicious. Circe does a fantastic brunch. Its my new favorite spot.
February 22, 2014|The mussels were ok. Next|4|The mussels were ok. Next time I'd skip the appetizers (except the olives) and go right to the entree which was very good.
February 22, 2014|Great local food|5|Really enjoyed the wonderful food pairings and great drinks. The mojito I had was the best one I've ever had. We started with the cheese tray which also included small cubes of beets, walnuts and a compote in addition to the cheese. Delicious! We went to this location when it was another restaurant...they have done a great deal to improve the interior.
February 21, 2014|Impressive|5|Our server was attentive and intuitive. The food was fresh and it's presentation was a work of art. We will definitely return!
February 21, 2014|Wonderful!!|5|Everything we had was great. Mushroom Bolognese salmon over vegetables and the mussels app... All great! Such a great find
February 16, 2014|Fantastic food and atmosphere|5|Everything about this place was fantastic except for our service. More specifically the waitress. The bartender who happened to be the owner was fantastic he gave us a taste of this fantastic Pinot noir that we wound up buying a bottle of. The waitress on the other hand was not good at all. We never saw her except when she brought our food to the table. Never came back to ask how it was and also said she would bring us bread but that never came either. I would say we probably saw her every 20 mins or so throughout our visit. But still never asked if we enjoyed our meal. The food was absolutely great. It was exactly what we thought it would be and the portion size was right on. We were full but not stuffed. I will definitely return again.
February 14, 2014|Perfect for any occasion|5|Whether a special occasion or just craving fabulous food from a fabulous menu, Circe is the new hot spot in Rhode Island! The atmosphere at Circe is one of comfort and elegance. The staff is courteous, the restaurant is clean and once again the food is phenomenal!!!
Dined on February 14, 2014|Couldn't handle volume.|4|This was my first experience at Circe. Food was great, ambiance as well. However it was valentines day and they were extremely busy and unable to keep up. With multiple people handle the hosting duties that was an initial source of confusion. Once we were seated our waiter came over with an excellent attitude and was very informative and proper. Once the food wait became longer than usual the waiter would walk by and avoid eye contact in stead of stop by and give the almost done line or apologize for the wait. They also forgot to bring us our dessert but remembered to bring the check and the espresso was sub-par and not very warm. All things considered it think it is a great restaurant and would love to go on a weeknight, just not a holiday
February 9, 2014|Great Service|4|When we arrived we were greeted by a hostess and Carlo, the owner. Evelyn, our server, visited us enough that we were attended to but no so much that we were disrupted. Carlo also visited the table a few times, even personally making a special drink for my girlfriend. Everyone will find something that they will love on the menu. We were very pleased with the qualify and speed of the kitchen- everything was delicious.
February 8, 2014|waited forever for our dinner|2|waited forever for our dinner - no bread offered - waiter disappeared and we had to flag another waiter to order dessert
February 8, 2014|Great food and ambience|4|Went with some friends and all loved the diverse menu, small plates, appetizers and main courses which are broad across all food types. Very happening place and the bar was packed but it was not too loud or crowded.
February 8, 2014|Good but $$$|5|My wife & I enjoyed a wonderful dinner but we were a bit surprised when the check came - one entree was $50 BUT it was VERY good just thought it really should have been $35-$44 before they SHOULD have mentioned the price - Shame on us for not asking! as my wife and I agreed - the Food, the Service were both Very Good but Honestly, we would consider alternative restaurants.
January 31, 2014|dining experience|2|I found the atmosphere to be beautiful, T he bar area looked like fun. The dining experience was poor. Small portions and not very good. The service was slow and alot of mistakes with the drink orders. I would go again for a drink but not for dinner.
January 30, 2014|Circe is a beautiful space|5|Circe is a beautiful space with a fantastic menu. Tina the bartender mixes great cocktails.
January 25, 2014|Good find|4|Had a father daughter dinner, and from appetizer to dessert it was delicious. Very generous appetizer of mussels we shared was enough for 4 people. Our dinners were perfect. Great service! Two thumbs up!
January 25, 2014|New Favorite Providence Restaurant|5|The food, service, and drinks were all excellent! We were out to dinner to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. We had eaten here a week earlier for the first time and knew that we wanted to come back as soon as possible. I loved the lamb meatballs appetizer and the brussels sprouts (cooked in duck fat with bacon) and my husband loved the salmon. The service was great without being intrusive. Oh, and the drinks were perfect! We will be back soon!
January 25, 2014|Love it!!|5|We came for dinner with friends at the beginning of January and every one of us raved about our meals. My husband and I enjoyed it so much that we came back at the end of January to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is a true gem.
January 20, 2014|Worth a visit and many revisits|4|We were there for lunch on MLK day so it was almost empty, but the food was excellent and service was quite prompt and attentive. They may have just been grateful to have anyone there, but they treated us like royals. I'd like to go back for dinner just to experience the bar scene and how well they do when the place is crowded, but I'm very optimistic.
January 17, 2014|Outstanding!|5|This was our second trip to Circe and I had asked to go for my birthday. I was not disappointed. We happened to go during restaurant week and ordered the 3 course meal that they had for restaurant week. I had crab cakes, trio of pork and espresso creme brûlée. All were outstanding! The service was outstanding, I was a little nervous that the restaurant was crowded and the tables are very close together, but after about a half hour some of the tables emptied and it was quieter. I'm not sure what the restaurant's policy is for seating upstairs, next time I think I will ask if that is a possibility. The food flavors are unique and exceptional. I look forward to my next visit!
January 11, 2014|fabulous|5|Been here for drinks and apps but dined here before seeing wicked at ppac and chose the restaurant week menu. Everything was amazing...kind server, excellent waiter, quick food witha amazing flavor. We will be back a true gem of a restaurant.
January 10, 2014|Loving Circe|5|Circe is wonderful. The food is impeccable. Staff is very educated in all they have to offer. Have dined here 3 or 4 times and always a incredible experience.
January 9, 2014|Business Dinner|4|I have had several business lunches at Circe, and all were excellent. The food options hit most people's appetite and the service has been quite good. This last occasion was for a business dinner, and during restaurant week. Most of us ate off the restaurant week Menu and all seemed to enjoy our meals & dessert.
January 9, 2014|Atmosphere, food & service|5|Atmosphere, food & service were all impeccable ! Enjoyed our meals immensely .
January 4, 2014|Good, really good - a few glitches:|3|Circe has really great food, they just need to tighten up their game. There are a few areas that should be improved upon right away: Coat check - we kind of awkwardly draped our coats over our chair backs. Not classy. Giant TV at the bar: muted and placed so that the bar patrons can see & hear, but not the dining room guests. Table placement and lighting: I had to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu because the wall sconce was above and behind me causing my head to cast a shadow over the menu. My partner's side of the table was completely dark. Staff: if the kitchen is out of an item, tell us prior to taking our order, not after (I really wanted those scallops!). We'll try this again, hopefully improvements will have been made.
January 4, 2014|Dinner before PPAC|4|Everything went perfectly. Table was ready and we were immediately seated. Service was very good....menu specials explained in a way that I wanted to try them all! Presentation was great, I tried the wild mushroom bologonese appetizer that was fabulous....All our entrees were very good And a nice surprise, when check came our waiter explained that they took 10% off since we were going to the show at PPAC I am looking forward to going back there soon!
January 4, 2014|Delicious|5|"We went to Circe before going to see Wicked at the PPAC. Couldn't say enough wonderful thing about Circe. We were not rushed, but our server was aware that we needed to leave in time for our show. The food was like heaven in my mouth. There was not one weak dish. My husband got a drink called ""The Esquire"" that he said was wonderful. On top of the food, the service was impeccable. Our waitress was pleasant and joked, but once she received the information she sought, she was gone allowing us time to ourselves. The other wait staff was equally helpful and friendly. We will definitely be returning!"
December 31, 2013|Loved it|5|Great server, special was terrific had the two pound lobster presentation was excellent. Loved the mood and the food
December 31, 2013|Good But|3|"""We had dinner at Circe New Years Eve & it will likely be our last. The restaurant is nicely decorated, the service was great with the owner being very involved. But our issue is how cold the restaurant is especially near the door. We knew from other reviews & asked to be seated away from the door in our reservations, but we were seated in the front section. The food was good, the spinach and romaine salad was fresh but under dressed. The pumpkin ravioli was good but was skimpy on the filling. The Crab Risotto and bread pudding were very good."" Open Table, the note I put in the reservation was completely ignored, as a matter of fact when I asked the owner who sat us he knew nothing of our request to be away from the door and the cold."
December 31, 2013|Wonderful New Years Eve|5|We had the most wonderful New Year's Eve dinner at Circue. The food was amazing and they accommodate a food allergy (gluten) just fine. The best part was that no one rushed us at all through our meal, despite the fact it was a holiday and they could have been trying to turn over tables quickly if they wanted. It was just a perfect evening - thanks for a great night!
December 28, 2013|Great Night Out|5|The quality of food paired with the outstanding ambience, make Circe a definite fantastic night out!
December 28, 2013|Excellent Food & Wait Staff but...|4|We went there for my birthday and had a wonderful meal and Dave the waiter was terrific and attentive. The only problem was that it was noted on the Open Table reservation, via email to the restaurant owner, and it was mentioned to the waiter that we were there to celebrate a birthday (mine). Nothing was done until we were literally on our way out the door at the end of the meal. The owner did recover though and made a very generous gesture that was very much appreciated. These things happen and the service and food were both excellent. We will definitely go back.
December 27, 2013|My sister and i took mom here|4|My sister and i took mom here as part of a dinner and a show gift. Since I had been before and the dessert was amazing, I suggested we order a few apps and share a couple of eentrés in order to save room. The butternut squash soup was creamy and light, and the grilled corn had a pleasant kick from the chipolte sause. We also tried the beets, which were good but I didn't care for the gouda cheese that was part of the dish. For mains, we had the duck duo which was divine, especially with the lime vanilla potatoes. Also ordered a steak with scallops, but the duck was definitely the favorite. Sadly, the dessert I so fondly remembered was not on the menu and the chef has changed so while good it wasn't fantastic. Service was excellent
December 22, 2013|pre-Christmas brunch with friends|4|had a lovely brunch with friends from CT, MA, RI-good central meeting place! friendly staff, very clean, great food!
December 18, 2013|Circe - A Wonderful Experience|5|"We enjoy the choices in menu at Circe. There are small plates and larger plates so that we usually have several small plates and then share an entree or two. Food is great and service excellent. Had beef tartar, a salmon pasta dish, and mussels - ""small plates - and then a duck entree. All were great and an interesting assortment."
December 14, 2013|Fun Night Out With Friends|4|We had a great night at Circe. The food was good, the service was great, and the atmosphere was conducive to loud talking and laughter. They have a deejay that spins later in the evening so we stayed after dinner for cocktails and dancing. If you're looking for a quiet night out, I would recommend somewhere else, but for a fun group of friends this is the perfect spot.
December 13, 2013|NYC Vibe & Feel in Providence|4|Went this past Friday and had a great time. Food was excellent. Ambience was great but we were there when there was a lot of Christmas parties and it was hard to hear conversation. Service was good considering the crowd. Would definitely recommend. One thing they need to work on was cold air coming into the restaurant everytime someone came in and left. We ended up eating with our coats on but everything else made up for it. They do have the beginnings of a plastic vestibule in front of the main door. But without the plastic door, it doesn't keep out the cold.
December 7, 2013|Fabulous Experience|5|Circe was a fabulous dining experience! The complimentary valet parking was much appreciated in the cold weather. We had made a reservation for 8pm, but arrived early and had drinks at the bar. The drinks were delicious, and the bartender was great. We were seated for dinner promptly at 8pm. Our server was friendly, well informed about the menu and specials.The food arrived promptly and was amazing! We were so excited about each other's dishes, we were sharing bites of each. Dessert was delicious also. The atmosphere was pleasant, dimly lit with a nice ambiance. The restuarant was full, but not too loud; we could easily hear each other talk. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and we look forward to returning.
December 7, 2013|"""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"""|5|I don't know if anyone from The Food Network has been to Circe and tried the Jonah crab and sweet corn risotto, but it is truly the best thing I ever ate! The overall dining experience is one of the best my husband and I can recall, from service to ambience and of course food and drink. An unforgettable night from start to finish that made us wish that we lived nearby so that we could become regulars!
December 7, 2013|Great Spot Downtown!|4|We loved our meals at Circe -- deliciously fresh and inventive salads, fabulous halloumi and veggie kebabs, and a great slice of not-too-sweet cheesecake with a tasty graham cracker crust. The service was very good (if a bit inconsistent), and the cold breeze blowing in whenever the front door opened took away some of the pleasure of the evening. But, overall, this was a great find downtown, and we'd gladly come back again.
December 6, 2013|Excellent|4|We had a wonderful dinner. Tables were a bit close, but the atmosphere is great. Very relaxing.
December 6, 2013|Great Experience|5|We were visiting Providence for a college visit and Circe was an excellent experience to top off a wonderful day. My wife and son shared the surf and turf Lobster & Filet. There was plenty for both and they were commenting the next day what a great meal. I tried the locally raised chicken and brussel sprouts special and was pleasently suprised how different and juicy the chicken tasted from what I normally get from the supermarket. The mashed potatoes were a little mushy, but overall I really enjoyed my meal. The service was smart, attentive and welcoming. Wish I had tried a cocktail but we had to attend another event at the school and I didn't want alchol on my breath. Maybe next time.
December 1, 2013|Rainy Sunday Brunch|4|A friend and I went to Circe for brunch when they opened on a Sunday at 10:00. There was no one else in the restaurant when we arrived so it was very quiet. The food was decent...nothing to rave about. The waitress was attentive and kind.
November 30, 2013|Pleasant Surprise|5|I really enjoyed this restaurant from the quality of my steak to the donuts and coffee ice cream for desser. It was a perfect evening.
November 29, 2013|A+|5|First time dining at Circe and cannot wait to return. The decor, the atmosphere, the service were all outstanding. The food was incredible. Ordered the duck and pork tenderloin, both were amazing. The tenderloin was moist and flavorful. Not eating duck often, and when asked how to order it was unsure of the best answer, the waiter was very helpful in guiding me. We dined just before a show at PPAC and it was ideal location, we had a leisurely meal. We cannot wait to go back.
November 24, 2013|A gem in downtown Providence|4|(Good location for gluten sensitive) The service was great, even accommodating us with a window table on a very chilly night. The view onto Weybosset was terrific. The food and cocktails were great (cocktails were tasty and inventive), with a solid wine selection. The menu selections had ample variety for all tastes. They were also very accommodating to a member of our party with gluten-sensitivity. I will go back on my next trip to Providence.
November 23, 2013|Two steaks ordered medium|2|Two steaks ordered medium were very rare. Waiter said sorry. Owner said they were having kitchen problems. I say it's going to be a long time before i go back.
November 23, 2013|Pizzaz|5|The restaurant was very fresh with a dynamic menu and ambiance . I ordered the tuna and it was delish! The next time I go, I want to try the cheese plate, it looked inviting. I will definitely be back, I enjoyed myself and so did my group! Keep up the level of service and quality and this place will thrive! The menu had something for every picky palate, even vegetarians and it was hard to make a decision. My group ordered the bread pudding for dessert and oohed and aah'd, I was trying to practice self control so I didn't have any but even if I had changed my mind, it was all gone so I guess that says it all. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Only one quick comment, during the winter, don't sit near the door, it can be a bit chilly.
Dined on November 23, 2013|Nice Place|4|We had a nice evening there, the service was impeccable and the food was good. We had two appetizers and a salad and then split the entree between us. The kitchen split it which was surprising since it was a veal porterhouse and had a bone. Overall I would recommend.
November 16, 2013|Great Service and Attention|5|The minute we arrived, we were greeted by Emily, the hostess. She was so attentive!! She spent ime with us, making sure we were happy with the table we wanted. She stopped by to make sure everything was OK throughout the evening. Thank you!! The waiter was also great. He too the time to explain all dishes as well as wine selections, The apps were just wonderful. Oysters were the best with the condiments. The owner stopped at our tabla and was was very attentive and friendly. Just a very nice evening. It was my wife's birthday and they made it a great experience. Lot's of energy later with music and people. Wish I could have kept it going!!!
November 16, 2013|Good food and reasonably priced|4|Really interesting selections, great food. Reasonably priced for downtown Providence. Waiter was wonderful - really good service (checking in, remembering allergies, refilling water) and very accommodating for vegetarians (no problem getting the brussel sprouts without duck fat and bacon) and those with food allergies. Would definitely go again.
November 16, 2013|outstanding food. everything|5|outstanding food. everything in the kitchen is being done just right. BUT... there is some disconnect here, maybe not enough staff ? our waitress was great, very attentive, but we were not offered bread while waiting and other tables were, would have been nice with salad course, and food came out slowly, it was early on on a Sat night, the place was not packed or anything and we noticed the couple next to us waited even longer. still worth the wait in terms of food quality and I will go back
November 2, 2013|A gem in Providence!|5|Great food and nice vibe throughout the restaurant. Excellent menu. The hostess was very helpful and the waiter was great. All of our entrees were excellent--lamb shanks, chicken and filet mignon. The restaurant was quite busy and it is easy to see why.
November 2, 2013|Brine and Belly|4|"Food and service was great. More then I had hoped for. Reviews were correct. A little noisy with a party upstairs. The only thing I would change. The scallop dish. It was excellent, but shared the spotlight with the pork belly beneath it. Too much in fact, pork belly kinda took over the dish . Great dish Chef, but add a scallop and nix some of the pork belly. Or change the name to "" Brine and Belly."""
November 2, 2013|a new favorite|5|first timer..food was creative, varied and delicious. Love the variety of small plates. Open kitchen fun to watch as restaurant filled up on a busy Saturday night- impressive friendliness of chefs and seriousness as they focused.
October 26, 2013|Local flavor with a flare|5|Appreciated the locally inspired menu with many farm fresh seasonal selections. Beginning with RI oysters and an iced cucumber topping; Schartner farm beets combined with smoked Gouda and balsamic pearls. Generous portion of lightly seared ahi tuna. Attentive service offered detailed description of dishes with suggested modifications to suit our needs. Nice atmosphere for celebrating a special occasion.
October 25, 2013|Super chef|5|We dined here on Fri nite and liked the menu so much, we went back on Sat nite. Unusual selections, beautifully presented, delicious meals. Bar can be noisy, but there is a very quiet second floor option, for those like us who want to have conversations with our dining companions. Decor is smart, waitstaff is knowledgable and professional. Overall one of the best Providence dining experiences we have had.
October 19, 2013|Invested owner!|5|One of the main things I enjoyed at this restaurant was seeing the owner, Carlo, constantly over seeing everything. To be successful every restaurant owner should be as involved as this! The food, ambiance and service are all top notch! I only personally wish there was a Spanish-speaking server for my husband's benefit but even still Carlo engaged him warmly and we both felt well-attended to. I will return for brunch and lunch next time!
October 17, 2013|interesting|5|brilliant combination of ingredients. I mean pork belly and scallops? to die for. On top of it owner cruising the tables and asking the all important question: Can we do it any better? I say your right on track. We cant wait to come back and try something else on the menu. Cheers from Seattle!
October 12, 2013|from Boston|5|my group of friends and I traveled down to Providence from Boston for the WaterFire. When making dinner reservations, we wanted to go to Federal Hill for Italian but no one could accommodate a group of 9. I picked Circe somewhat at random after looking at a few of the other reviews on OpenTable and Yelp. We were not disappointed at all. The drinks were quite well made, especially the cucumber martini - so smooth and delicious. Extra points for having blue cheese stuffed olives. Everyone raved about their meal, and we could not believe the portion sizes! The amount of ahi tuna on my plate was enormous, and the pork belly with the scallops was huge! Delicious food, great service, good atmosphere, reasonably priced.
October 12, 2013|Amazing experience|5|Food was unbelievable. Service was great. Only complaint is that valet parking was not complimentary for diners, as was stated on the website. It was a Waterfire night, but still the restaurant should eat the extra cost to provide this service to customers...it just doesn't look good.
October 12, 2013|What a Treat|5|"This restaurant was fantastic. We were 5 including a 8 year old and we all loved our dinner. Food was great, service really attentive. The ""good"" looking owner stopped by our table to make sure we didn't need anything. I would go back to Providence just to eat there again."
October 12, 2013|first visit and will visit again|4|Very good experience on a busy Saturday. Enjoyed the food and the service. Owner very attentive. We will be back.
October 7, 2013|Amazing|5|Brought a friend for her Birthday and had such a great time. Kevin was our waiter and he was the best. Very kind but also joked along with us. The drinks from the margarita to the busted nut were delish and the meal was outstanding. I will be back soon!
October 5, 2013|The food at Circe is outstanding,|5|The food at Circe is outstanding, as well as the service we received! I had the 16oz sirloin meal with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach, it was fantastic! For dessert we shared the coffee and donuts, which was delicious! I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family.
October 3, 2013|Food was exquisite - without|5|Food was exquisite - without being precious - and the service was terrific. We eat out 3-4 times a week and this was one of the best meals and dining experiences we've had in a long time!
September 28, 2013|Just OK|3|Wife and attend had dinner her on 9/28/2013 to celebrate her birthday. We both thought it was just ok. likely would not return. T he decor was good but restaurant was really noisy and table were far to close to each other. Service was average, nothing special. The food was delicious but I ordered a steak which came pre-sliced. In my opinion, a basic pleasure in ordering a steak is being able to cut it as you eat. Why would anyone want a pre-cut steak?!? The steak was good but again, I can probably get a comparable steak at Outback.
September 28, 2013|Exceptional Restuarant|5|Wonderful food and great service. The wait staff are very educated from the wine to all the food. Making it not just a dinner but more of an experience. Will be back soon.
September 21, 2013|Very Good Restaurant..We'll Return!|4|"A ""food as art"" (faa) restaurant. Excellent quality! Beautifully presented. Excellent service, nice atmosphere Two in our party had tenderloin filets, one had chicken, and I had pumpkin ravioli. All enjoyed their meals. My only complaint is that given the cost, portions could have been more generous, but that is generally characteristic of all faa establishments. We plan to return, but the cost and nature of presentation, will make it an occasional event."
September 21, 2013|Celebrating our anniversary|5|Celebrating our anniversary and the restaurant went above and beyond. From the lovely and knowledgable hostess to the server who was a delight (Ahmad?) it was a wonderful culinary experience.
September 14, 2013|Great restaurant but..|2|Difficult to review as we really enjoyed the food, the lovely restaurant and the creativity of the kitchen. I want to highly recommend the restaurant. Only problem was that near the end of the meal I did not feel well and turned out had some type of allergic response that soured the wonderful day and excellent meal with my wife, my son and his girlfriend. It was probably the oyster but I cannot be sure; had hives/swelling over 50% of my body that took three days to resolve and had to take antihistamine. An unfortunate ending to a great beginning and they all told me the dessert was fabulous.
August 24, 2013|Great staff, location and menu|4|The location is excellent, steps to WaterFire. Valet was efficient and fast. The Owners/Managers were very welcoming and conversational, curious how we found the restaurant and why we chose it. We got there early and they gave us a great seat to have a birds eye view of the room. The menu was full of great, fresh options. The beer list was on the weak side, would've like to see beers that could possibly include local microbrews, but at this point I'm just looking for things to be slightly critical of. The most challenging part of the night was trying to choose what to order, really terrific menu. It's all around a great choice for dinner, on the higher scale. Great staff, great menu, and really impressive food.
August 23, 2013|Our waitress Amy was great,|5|Our waitress Amy was great, very informed. The food was awesome. From start to finish Circe made our 16th year wedding anniversary very special. I suggest the Bombster scallops for an app. The salmon was spot on, as well as my wife's duck which she requested medium. The intermezzo of peach sorbet was a nice touch, as well as the chef sending out a crab app with a wanton wrapper, on the house. The owner was present and made sure everything was to our liking. We will definitely be back!
August 10, 2013|Great new restaurant - gotta try it|5|Everything was outstanding! Food, portions, wine list service. This is NOT a redo of Downcity as seem on Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon Ramsey would approve. Providence Foodie
July 27, 2013|Wonderful new gem in Providence|5|From the decor to the waitstaff to the owner to the food, Circe was top notch. Looking forward to going back soon.
July 25, 2013|CIRCE, GODDESS of CULINARY DELIGHT|5|With a name drawn from Greek mythology, that of CIRCE, Goddess of herbs and potions, to an upscale urban boîte in the heart of Downtown Providence's thriving night scene...this is CIRCE,...a hip but accommodating restaurant that you'll want to visit again and again for the food, atmosphere and camaraderie. Or is it the smidgen of herbs and potions that these modern-day culinary gods and goddesses add to the food to get us to keep coming back? Who knows? Gods never reveal their sources...or sauces for that matter. Carlo and his capable staff really know what to do.
July 20, 2013|My wife and I were in for|5|My wife and I were in for restaurant weeks and had a great experience. The Bombster scallops rocked, the wine pairings for $13.95 were well worth it. The Charcuterie board we added as we both enjoy this item and it did not let us down. Nice job to the kitchen staff you folks surely should be listed as one of the best places in Providence. Our waitress was on point and very nice, we will be back very soon.
July 20, 2013|Our waitress Amy was so wonderful!|5|Our waitress Amy was so wonderful! food was amazing!!
July 19, 2013|Good food|4|First time dining at Circe. The food was good with some good creativity in it. Dessert were good too but they could be even better. They have also a great cocktail list so do not forget to try those too
July 16, 2013|loved it!|5|Plan to return next visit to Providence, great service delicious food.
July 16, 2013|AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|5|This is a top notch place in providence. It is my new favorite in town! Everything to service to food, this place is 5 stars!
July 13, 2013|Fantastic choice|5|We go down to Waterfire every year; this year we decided to make a reservation. Great choice! We were stuffed. Started with the mushroom ravioli and then one of us had the mushroom risotto (with enough leftover for lunch) and the other had the pork tenderloin. Both were absolutely delicious! The margarita was good too but in retrospect a glass of wine would have been better with dinner. Ambiance and decor were both lovely as well. We will definitely remember Circe!
June 26, 2013|BYOB?|4|The food was excellent, but the wine list was sparse and over-priced. Best to try making it to the 4-6 PM half-price Small Plates at the bar scene.
June 20, 2013|Love it, Great Location within|4|Love it, Great Location within walking distance to the PPAC. Food was great
June 15, 2013|fanatstic food|5|Highly recommend Circe. Food was amazing, service excellent and prices just right.
June 8, 2013|Circe has it all!|5|The ambience is perfect - the decor elegant. Our food was spectacular - everything we ordered surpassed our expectations. The grilled oysters really stand out!! Our server was delightful and management made sure we were happy. Truly a great night out!!!
June 8, 2013|Good food, a bit pricey|3|"As befits the name of the restaurant, it sports a very ""ancient Greece"" feel with the servers and décor all in black and white. Our server was attentive and helpful. The salads were quite large and very fresh. The cheese plate was more modest but offered excellent pairings to go with the cheeses. Dinner was pasta and an excellent beef tenderloin. Portions were reasonable and the food was excellent. On our way out, however, the valet tried to shake us down for $10 even though the restaurant offers complimentary valet service. The argument was that it was a Waterfire night, but we were clearly not attending. We did NOT pay the fee, but we found the attempt to collect it after the fact extremely tasteless for a $150+ for two restaurant."
May 26, 2013|Brunch|4|Went for brunch twice and once dir dinnet~I'm a foodie the pork belly hash weren't all they were revved up to be. The French toast is amazing and so is the crab cake~
Dined on May 25, 2013|Food was delicious. Service|5|Food was delicious. Service was pleasant. My only complaint: it took the restaurant 25 min to bring dessert.
May 25, 2013|Fantastic cheese board, excellent|5|Fantastic cheese board, excellent sangria, and quite possibly, the best dessert we have ever tried... and we eat A LOT of dessert. The server was delightful with just the right amount of attentiveness coupled with good knowledgable suggestions... it was at her recommendation that we tried the dessert tasting plate. Atmosphere is a bit posh, but fun, and if you can get seats away from the bar, the noise level is bearable.
May 25, 2013|Too loud|3|Food was good, service was fine, but was way too loud. The noise at the bar overtakes the entire restaurant.
May 25, 2013|What an exciting new entry|5|What an exciting new entry to Providence's vibrant culinary tradition. The service level even stood out more than the food, which is unusual these days but I will bet is due to the hands on nature of the principal owner and chef. Everyone should give Circe a try and when pleased, try again! We will.
May 23, 2013|Fabulous find!|5|Found this place by searching open table for somewhere new and different to try. Definitely were not dissapointed and will go back. The ambiance was wonderful and the menu even better. Interesting menu definitley fit for foodies. If you are looking for ordinary food that anyone can make at home STAY AWAY. If you are looking for interesting and new foods to try it's your place. The roasted beet salad with hazelnutswas wonderful. I never had polenta as a dessert but this one is definitely worth going back for.
May 12, 2013|Mother's Day 2013|5|Circe was fantastic on Mother's Day!! Our party of nine was seated immediately and we had an awesome server. Drinks were delicious and the food was delicious. Sunday brunch menu was the same price as any other Sunday would be. Amazing for a holiday as popular as M.D. I had chicken and waffles and it was delicious. Simply Sinatra by Mike Dutra was just an added bonus. Cannot wait to get there again.
May 12, 2013|Circe is what dining out should be.|5|The experience here on Mother's Day for brunch was just perfect. Couldn't have asked for better atmosphere, food, or service. Everything was delicious and picture perfect. Friends, family, and fun that's what it's all about in this fun and bright space. Throw in an excellent menu and great staff and you have the perfect spot. They even have complimentary valet! This is a top ten restaurant in Providence for sure. Will most definitely be going back!
May 11, 2013|Very good but...|4|The service, appetizers and drinks were great, but the pasta primavera was a little bland and the salmon entree was a bit dry. Also, although it was very pleasant, the service was a little fast. For what Circe promises, a more relaxed pace would have been nice. Maybe next time we will ask that they slow it down and relax a bit.
May 11, 2013|Great find|4|As soon as I walked in I knew I was in for a treat. Knowing the restaurant was categorized under tapas I figured it was going to be small dishes. I had the pork belly morcella and scallops app. And it was outrageous, the only criticism is the order is small it should be offered as a large plate as well. Service was a bit slow granted its a busy place. You can see into the kitchen which I love as a professional cook myself, there was no sense of urgency from the cooks which in my opinion was why service was slow. But all in all food was fantastic. The ribeye I had was so tender and had the perfect amount of fat.
May 10, 2013|After enjoying several lunches|3|After enjoying several lunches at Circe, I decided to make a reservation for Friday night. Circe was busy, but not filled to capacity. My friend and I ordered the confit duck pizza (a special) for an appetizer. It fell a little short of our expectation based on our waitresses description. The duck was dry, probably due to being cooked on the pizza, and the crust was doughy in texture. I ordered Salmon for my entree which was slightly over-cooked. However my friend ordered the scallops which were cooked to perfection and delicious. I had high hopes for dinner at Circe, but I was underwhelmed. I have enjoyed delicious lunches at Circe, so I definitely recommend venturing to Circe for lunch. As for dinner, perhaps it was an off night
April 27, 2013|One of the best new restaurants|5|One of the best new restaurants to open in Providence in quite a while.
April 21, 2013|Brunch was a hit!|5|Great food and great service. $18 bottomless champagne during brunch was definitely a perk. We stayed for a while and didn't feel rushed at all. Will def be back soon for another Sunday brunch!
April 14, 2013|We went for brunch pre-theatre.|4|We went for brunch pre-theatre. Nice selection and delicious food. There was a baby shower going on upstairs, so it was very noisy. Probably would have chosen somewhere else if we had known about that. Server apologized that food was coming out slowly because of the party, but we still were finished in plenty of time to make our show.
April 11, 2013|Great Old Southern service|4|The decor reminded me of Old Southern, lots of white columns inside....the food was very good, our waitress Carla was just the best - friendly, enthusiastic about the restaurant (she also cooks in the kitchen, so she really knew about the menu offerings). The only downside was the noise....between the bar and the kitchen and the staff shouting at each other, it was difficult to really carry on a conversation. I would give it one more try but I definitely would request a seat upstairs.
April 9, 2013|Lovely meal - well taken care|4|Lovely meal - well taken care of - host station had not read my special request for seating as we were celebrating a special birthday. Initially sat us in an OK seat and then immediately offered something much more special - in an area of the house that was not really open at that time but with a lovely view and a very accommodating waiter.
March 30, 2013|A great experience from the|5|A great experience from the time the valet greeted us to the time the valet brought our car when we were leaving. We were immediately and cordially welcomed and seated. The wait staff was personable and informative. We had the advantage of being seated at the chef's table and enjoyed watching the professional staff and all of the great dishes being prepared. We had several appetizers and ended up sharing all of our entrees. Every bite was delicious. I can't wait to go back.
March 29, 2013|Overpriced. Good, not great.|4|Had an enjoyable dinner. Everything was good. Some people will find the portions to be small. Most sides are a lacart. Prices are rather high for what you get. The place has potential but right now it's only good, not great. Lowering the prices or throwing in a side would be smart.
March 23, 2013|A little disappointed when|4|A little disappointed when the small plate seared bombster scallop arrived to our table & there was only 1 scallop. Would have loved if that small plate came with 2. It was yummy but definitely kept you wanting & wishing there was more (even if it were only 1 more). Drinks were amazing!
March 23, 2013|not enjoyable|1|food was great...service was terrible... asked for beer glass chilled...felt like it just came out of dishwasher....waiter brought a second one... 7 pm reservation and veal special was no longer available......... had to ask for salt and pepper, unfortunately by the time the waiter (Kevin) checked on us half of my meal was finished (unsalted).... asked for second beer w/chilled glass..it came with no glass (I used my old one)... one order of tuna w/spinach...asked twice more for spinach (2 different waiters)before 3rd waiter (Kevin) told us the kitchen was busy and we would not get it (he forgot to order it the first time.. he apologized for his error.. had a tuna dinner with no vegetable )... desert ice cream and coffee. coffee 10 min
March 19, 2013|I enjoyed Circe. The ambiance|4|I enjoyed Circe. The ambiance was great, the service was excellent. The waiter took care with all the little things he is very observant. The food was perfect,not too much and I left feeling like I ate a good meal but just enough
March 16, 2013|Went here to celebrate our|4|Went here to celebrate our engagement. The food is top-notch for a reasonable price. Don't expect big portions, but rather a journey thatyour ttaste buds will never forget. For a special occasion, this is the place to go. Gourmet for $20-$30 a plate? Please and thank you. Try the duck.
March 13, 2013|Great food. Will def. dine again|4|"One of the better meals I've had in metro Boston in a while. Food was excellent, actually fulfilled the aspirations of the menu which is harder and harder to find these days. Plate sizes were a little wacky. Some of the ""small"" plates were tapas size (eg single scallop) but others (the mussels) were huge, so we ended up with more food than expected. Not a huge problem given how tasty everything was. If anything was lacking, the coffee and cappuccino could have been a little better. The service had a couple of bumps, check mix up, and coat snafu, but was friendly and genuine, which I appreciate more than flawless execution. Decor was nice, clean, trendy. Really loved this place - will definitely dine at Circe again."
March 2, 2013|The best night in town!!|5|First time at this restauran from the moment you step into the place you feel different!! the ambiance, people, decoration, it is so unique and romantic, chic but at the same time elegant, I believe it is the place to celebrate any occasion!! Price is good and the wine list excellent!! good for a very intimate dinner but after 10pm for a night full of fun, the music and people made our night unforgetable!!
March 2, 2013|Food was fantastic and our|5|Food was fantastic and our waitress was very attentive. After 10 PM the restaurant had a DJ playing fun high energy music and it turned into a night club with a relaxed atmosphere. What was thought to be a couple hour dinner turned into a full night out.
February 25, 2013|Fantstic first visit|5|We had read the RI Monthly review and were intrigued. Our experience was top-notch, in all respects. We were there on a Monday, received the far-corner table, and the staff turned the music volume down for us. That wouldn't happen on a busy Friday night; so if you come for the food, come on Monday! And the food was indeed fantastic. Creative, careful in the details, balanced, never forced. Absolute winners: scallop ceviche (perfect thinness), grilled oysters (incredible flavor blending), pasta with lobster and truffle (rich, complex harmony), and the amazing dessert: Apple-Ginger-Polenta Crisp, with two kinds of Sauce Anglaise (texture heaven). Ask for the knowledgeable, flexible, simply terrific waitor Jason!
