On both visits he staff was very friendly and accommodating, our table was ready right at our reservation time, and the food was great. We will be returning!

February 14, 2016|Excellent meal|5|I have been to Shula's multiple times and decided to take my wife there for Valentine's Day. A good choice. The food was tasty and the wedge salad large and delicious.
February 14, 2016|Not Great|2|"Most Providence steak houses were booked for Valentine's Day. Shula's had openings. We arrived and the restaurant was a third full at 5:30. The bread and tuna appetizer were good. My Caesar was overdressed and contained too much vinegar. We ordered a ny strip from Shula's special cuts. We were told that they had just sold the last one. Steak house with no strip at 6 on Valentine's Day. Ordered the filet, medium. It arrived and I cut into it, 3/4 of an inch deep. No pink at all. I sent it back. A small $38 filet should be perfect. The manager came over to talk to us. Apologized and said that if I had cut deeper it was (kissing his fingertips) ""perfect"". I said to send it back out, I would eat it. He said it was no problem, they had a fresh one on. So, he stopped by to tell me how ignorant I was? The new filet was good, not great. The baked potato was undercooked. He did offer us a drink for the wait. We had a glass of wine. Maybe it was an off night for them, but on Valentine's Day? They are away from the busy mall area, but the good restaurants are busy. Things were disappointing."
February 14, 2016|Less than expected|3|I had visited the Shula's steakhouse in Chicago many years ago, so my expectations were based on that experience. In comparison, I was disappointed in the quality of the steak selections. My party ordered the Rib Eye and Cowboy Steak, both were not as flavorful, more fatty, and of lesser quality than expected. I would say it wasn't worth the price.

February 13, 2016|Good Food, Great Service|4|Tried Shula's because we were staying at hotel and were pleasantly surprised. They have a good selection of dishes and a variety of steaks. The service is impeccable. Our waitress was knowledge about food and very efficient and pleasant. Would go back.
February 11, 2016|Beyond Horrible|2|Service was beyond bad!! Blackened steak tips tasted like they were dropped in charcoal and my entr√©e was dry and tasteless.
January 27, 2016|Great steak!!|5|I had one of the best steaks I ever had, cooked to perfection and didn't even need steak sauce. My server, Desiree was really good and was very friendly. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!
January 26, 2016|As always an excellent dinner and great ...|5|As always an excellent dinner and great service. Jeff , aOur server was very attentive to our every need.
January 21, 2016|Consistently good!|4|"Over the years, I have been to Shula's 347 many times despite not being a big Miami Dolphin fan. While a ""red meat"" fan, I was there for lunch with a friend who had never been there before despite being walking distance from work for him, and chose to get the wedge salad instead of a burger or steak. The salad was as good as I remembered it, my standard salad before dinner when there before. Zach was our waiter and gave my friend and I time to talk but was available right away to take our order and deliver it timely."
January 17, 2016|Overpriced|3|We were very disappointed with the quality of the food. The scallops were very salty and the steak was mediocre. The ambiance was lacking for such an expensive restaurant. Entrees did not include and salad or bread. The service was good, but not exceptional.
January 9, 2016|Excellent Steak House|5|I have been to many of the high end steak houses and I find this to be as good or better than the rest. Not only are the steaks top quality, good service, but the price is much more reasonable than the others. You not only get your steak, but a potato and vegetable come with it. I would highly recommend this location.
December 31, 2015|Loved the restaurant but the service was horrible!|4|Obviously the bartenders in Providence didn't want to be working on New Year's Eve. The food and restaurant were great but the bartenders were miserable. We had to badger them to put an order in or get another drink.

November 15, 2015|Delicious food|5|The salmon burger I had was very delicious, as were the fries! All of my friends were very happy with their meals. We also went last year and the year before (during the literacy convention down the block) and the food was consistently good! They are very accommodating, and didn't mind giving each of us a separate check.
November 6, 2015|Great steaks|4|We dined at Schula's 347 recently and enjoyed the Filet Minon and blackened steak tips. Both of our meals were delicious and cooked just like we ordered them.
October 24, 2015|NICE EXPERIENCE|4|we visited the restaurant in providence to celebrate our son's 14th birthday. when I made the reservation I did not realize that it was not the same type of Shula's that we visited in Orlando last winter. this restaurant was very casual and not as fancy, which we were expecting. However, the waitstaff was wonderful and the food was good. The steak was a tad overdone by still ok. I had the tenderloin medalions which I think were overpriced. At $28 for 2 pieces of meat, it left much to be desired. The desserts were very good. We had a nice evening and enjoyed it. I think that next time, it may be more of an appetizer and drinks before a show type of restaurant.
October 11, 2015|Nice Place|3|Arrived on a Sunday Night for dinner with my son. We were seated promptly and then greeted by our server who was very personable and guided us through the menu. Delightful wine menu. We enjoyed the fried calamari strips which were fresh and among the best we have ever had. Dinner service a bit of a hiccup as my son's filet mignon arrived mooing. Took us a few minutes to flag down staff and our server arrived shortly thereafter and took the steak back to kitchen. We waited an additional 40 minutes for the steak to be reserved. When server realized the snafu she was extremely apologetic and had manger comp the entree and desert. Gracious staff and a restaurant we recommend highly.
September 5, 2015|Shulas Providence|5|What a great find, we have been here a couple of times and it's just as good as the first visit. Staff is overly friendly. We find it enjoyable and look forward to returning.

June 27, 2015|Nice Find|5|Was a great experience, will def. go back. Our water David was very attentive.
May 24, 2015|food and service were 5 stars!|5|The service was excellent, we definitely will return when able!
May 16, 2015|Very quiet on a non-event night|4|Was very surprised to see how empty the restaurant was when there's no event at the Dunk. Overall, food was very good. Not as upscale as the Shula's Steakhouse (which would be on par with Ruth's and Capital), but definitely a solid place for a carnivore looking for some steaks but more burgers and sandwiches. Burgers were amazing, probably the best I've had in the Northeast, and the other dinners were very good (filet medallions, fish). Desserts were also very good (in this case, the creme brulee and key lime pie were better than the dessert I had had at the full-fledged Shula's in PA the week before). Kind of disappointed how quiet it was - I know they do a great business when there are events going, but hope more people go and it stays because it is a definite sleeper in the downtown area and one I'll go back to often!
March 14, 2015|Shula's 347 Grill  - Highly Recommended|4|I have eaten at Shula's several times both in Providence and New York and have never been disappointed. The food is always excellent, the restaurant has a pleasant environment, and the servers are always ready to go out of their way to make my dining experience as pleasurable as possible. In fact, at another table the night we were having dinner, someone in the party received their meal cold. The server couldn't stop apologizing, took the plate immediately to the kitchen to heat it up, and offered the diner a free drink. I thought the free drink was a nice gesture to apologize.
February 21, 2015|Fair Experience|3|My wife and I come to Providence quite a bit for performances at the Vet. We like to try new places to eat. The food was good. The service was poor. A large party came in and I think our waitress forgot about us. I was a little disappointed with the experience. I don't know if we would eat here again.
February 6, 2015|Not up to par for the price|2|Wasn't what I expected. We got a bottle of wine, appetizer, two steaks for $160. It doesn't even come close to what you get at Capital Grille or some other places. If it was closer to $100, I'd probably have been ok with it, but the server also seemed to either have a cold or be getting over a cold. Plus, they were out of the bottle of wine we ordered. I never understand how restaurants can run out of wine that is on the menu. Basically, good but overpriced for what you get. Service and food quality doesn't match the price range they are aiming for.
January 31, 2015|Nice spot|4|Food was very good, I would return. My entree was excellent, I had the ribeye. The apps were very good, but the hog wings were a little over done.
January 24, 2015|Bring deep pockets for not so much....|4|Atmosphere was not what I was expecting. It's more of a bar/restaurant trying to be upscale. Food was a little pricy, the NY Strip I had was $39 and at the price I would expect a excellent stake,it wasn't. Good but did not meet my expectations. Overall I might go back the only thing holding me back is the pricing.
January 10, 2015|Great Steaks Good Service|5|My wife and I went here on my birthday and both had the Cowboy steak. It was prepared perfectly and was very good. It came with a vegetable and potato so not like most expensive steak houses. I would recommend it if you wanted a great steak.
December 31, 2014|Just average. Probably wouldn't go runni...|3|Just average. Probably wouldn't go running back. In that price bracket, I have had much better. Worth a try, but not a Favorite.
December 7, 2014|Good choice for post P Bruins game|5|We have been going to the hockey games for 3 years and knew of the restaurant and decided to try. What a pleasant surprise as we arrived early for our reservation time, and we were seated promptly. Also a nice surprise was the half price apps and drafts, which to my husbands delight included Guinness Stout. For an app we chose the crab cakes, which we split and were excellent. I had the filet medallions which were cooked perfectly, as I like rare, which came with mashed potatoes and herbed carrotsand my husband had the bbq burger. We opted to take a piece of the triple chocolate cake to go, as we had an hour ride home. This steakhouse/sports bar will definitely be a repeat visit as we have more tickets for this season, Where entrees included sides this was an excellent value. I also received a follow up call the next afternoon from the restaurant inquiring as to if they could have done anything else to make our experience better.
December 6, 2014|Great place for pre-event dining|3|Located across the street from the Dunk, you will not find a better location. The calamari was EXCELLENT. I will be back.
December 6, 2014|Catch it before the event|4|Food was great. The server was aware we were going to the concert right next door so they made sure we were in and out in time. We made reservations for 5:30 and were seated at 5:30 when we walked in. They did not rush us but still got us served and paid for before the show. If you are in the area check this place out. I am a Patriots fan but good food is good food even if it is from a Dolphin Coach.
Dined on November 8, 2014|Awesome food|5|I consider myself a bit hard to please when eating out. I absolutely loved the taco appetizer and my burger was the best I have had! Definitely recommend this place!
September 27, 2014|5 Star|5|Great find. Awesome food. It is inside of the Hilton but your parking is validated. The view and location is great. The decoration is outstanding. You'll love it.
September 21, 2014|Excellent venue|5|Knew Shula's existed but had never been until 9/21. Pleasantly surprised!!!! Our server was excellent and this made for an enjoyable meal.
August 1, 2014|Great Steak|4|The food was very good, the waitress seemed awkward, nice woman but out of her element. The ambience was like a hotel bar, not what I expected , Ruth Chris has a much more elegant style. This really isn't a special place to dine, probably because it's in a hotel and the dining room is like a corridor. The meal was good but the atmosphere didn't feel special at all, and the waitress wasn't secure in her dealings with patrons.
June 28, 2014|Good food and service|4|The restaurant was completely dead on a Saturday night. I don't know why because the food and service was very good.
June 20, 2014|Great location.. Attentive staff|4|Good food, attentive and friendly staff in a great location.. Matt our waitir was AAAA+++. Will definitely go back with the kids.
June 13, 2014|Just OK|3|"Schulas 347 aspires to be a top notch steakhouse, but isn't quite there. The service was very good, but the steak is not up to the level of other first rate places. My son and I both had the ""cowboy"" ribeye. Very tender, cooked med rare, but was pre salted a little too much in my opinion. It was good, but not worth the $38.00 price. I have had much better at Capitol Grille, and Ruth's Chris for about the same price. The steak was more like you would get at Texas road house type of place. Again, it was good, but just priced a little too high for the quality of the food."
June 11, 2014|Apparently when we checked in the hostes...|5|Apparently when we checked in the hostess didn't register on her computer we had made a reservation through you. We did in fact have a reservation and enjoyed our dining experience.
May 31, 2014|This place should be on everyone's list ...|5|"This place should be on everyone's list of the ""under $50 for 2"" restaurants."
April 29, 2014|typical hotel restaurant but food better...|5|typical hotel restaurant but food better. not much action /
April 11, 2014|Repeat visit and just as good..|5|Usually I shy away from chain restsurants in hotels, but this is a memorable exception. Friendly server, outstanding service, great drinks, interesting apps and perfectly prepared food. I will return and will not only recommend it, but will look for other Shula's in my travels.
March 21, 2014|Good for lunch|5|not very busy for lunch so we got in an out with ease. Burgers are awesome!
March 16, 2014|FOOD NOT THAT GREAT...GOOD WAITRESS|2|First time here. The location right at the Hilton and next to the Dunk makes it convenient to people in the area. We ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon and the 14 oz NY Strip...both medium, which means pink center. When the steaks arrived, they were more medium well...no pink center. The manager asked to cut into the steak to make sure it was to our liking, we noticed that there was no pink in the center...but we decided to just go ahead and eat them. They were not tender, not juicy. For dessert we ordered the Dulce de Leche cheesecake and the key lime pie....none of them were very good..... the dulce de leche tasted more like molten toffee than caramel. The key lime pie was very very sour...
March 12, 2014|Great steak & service|5|Had an amazing 16oz Cajun Cowboy steak, it melted in my mouth! Matt was a great server, very attentive and paired a wine perfectly with our meal. Looking forward to our next visit!
March 1, 2014|Portions Need To Be Larger|3|Great food and nice Ambience, unfortuately the Portion size has a lot to be desired for the amount your paying to eat here. Appitizers especially are very small portions, & so are the Non Meat dishes. One thing I found odd, no bread was served at this location. As far as the quality of the food goes it was excellent, just not enough of it. Being a Don Shula & Dolphins Fan all my life I really liked the memorabilia on the walls & on display. If your looking for a high end Steak House where you get the same quality of food but a lot more of it for the same prices, go to Fred & Steves Steak House at Twin River.
February 28, 2014|Reasonable prices and options|4|Shulas may be known for steak but this restaurant offers a variety of options other than steak. Their burgers are amazing as well as their seafood. And the chef selected sides are creative and delicious. I have sat at the bar many times to enjoy an ice cold beer and a burger but my last experience brought me into the dining room. I had the sea scallops entr√©e which I highly recommend!
February 18, 2014|Avoid it on a game night|2|The hostess was curt even though we had reservation. The food was slow coming out of the kitchen. The server tried to be attentive but also slow. They could not seem to handle the crowd on a PC game night.
February 16, 2014|Great Food after the game|5|Want to get a good dinner after seeing the Providence Bruins game. Made the reservation, and got right in. Food was timely, atmosphere was great. Service was prompt and witty. Portions were reasonable. Everyone had a great time!
February 16, 2014|Shula's Beats All; Best Steak !|5|Short and sweet...Once you have had a Shula's steak - Filet mignon, Sirloin, Cowboy or Porterhouse - you will never want or settle for anything else. Shula's steaks are by far more flavorful and tender. Pairings of fresh salad, baked potato, and fresh asparagus make for a complete and fulfilling meal. Complement your dinner with an excellent mixed drink or choose from a selection of reasonably priced wine. My wife and I are Big Shula's fans...try Miami, Naples and Providence: All are fantastic! Bon Appetit.
February 15, 2014|Perfect for a Romantic Date|5|This restaurant offers great food, great service and an energetic environment! Their prices are excellent for the quality of food and service which you are receiving. I highly recommend Shula's 347 Grill!
February 15, 2014|Enjoyed the food, not the noise|4|My wife and I decided to get away and go for an overnight to Providence. Since a few of the notable nearby Italian restaurants were booked, and we knew it would be snowing very hard, we decided to try Shula's at our hotel. We split a wonderful salad. I had the tuna and my wife had a delicious fish sandwich. We really enjoyed all of the food. It was also notable that a number of staff came over at various times during our visit. It was, however, not the relaxing dinner at a nice restaurant that we had expected. There had to be about 150 or more boys staying at the hotel for a hockey tournament. Unfortunately, a group of boys near us went from a little loud to bar-like rowdy. Anyway, we may return, but not for a quiet evening. dinner.
February 14, 2014|Shula's is a good steakhouse.|3|Shula's is a good steakhouse. With prices similar to other high-end steakhouses, Shula's is subpar in terms of service and overall restaurant energy. The food is similar to high-end steakhouses.
February 14, 2014|Delicious every time|5|Had yet another wonderful meal at Shula's for Valentine's Day! Steak and lobster outstanding. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose from their delicious menu. Can't wait to head back again next time we are in RI!
February 14, 2014|Review|5|Everyone at Shulas Prov. does a Fantastic Job!!!!!!!!!! Special note to Gregg, Craig, Devon a Big Thank You and Managers are all about Customer Service.
February 14, 2014|Great dinning|5|The experience was excellent dinner. Was great. Definitely a place to continue to dine at
February 14, 2014|Met expectations|4|As expected, food was good, as expected from prior reviews. Menu was just a bit limited but understandable given it being a steak house. Most impressive and I mean really impressive was the staff. From the maitre d to our wonderful server Andre, the level of maturity and confidence of these young professionals was really nice to experience. All very polite and respectful, Andre had a very nice disposition, was professional at all times and knew the wine list exceptionally well. It's easy for a less than stellar server to make the dinning experience very forgetable. While the food was very good yet by no means exceptional, we'd return as it was a comfortable, professional environment and this suggests very consistant quality of product
January 21, 2014|Great meal before a game|4|We were a bit late for our reservation due to weather conditions but they had no problem accommodating us. We ordered sandwiches for a quick meal before a basketball game and we enjoyed them very much! Good service and good food.
January 18, 2014|Great service|4|The service was outstanding. Food was cooked to perfection. The bernaise was cold and oddly flavored. The restaurant was a bit noisy. Overall good experience.
January 11, 2014|Great Steaks|5|My wife and I went here for my birthday and had the Cowboy steak. It came with two sides. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were excellent. We also shared a Arugula salad that was more than enough for two people. The waiter was very pleasant and helpful. If you are looking for a good steak dinner I would recommend it. When you consider the sides you get it is a fair price for a quality steak.
December 31, 2013|Service was very good. Good|4|Service was very good. Good wine list. Boneless buffalo wings were the same exact as Applebee's offers. Prime rib special was not very flavorful. Mashed potatoes were excellent as we're the carrots.
December 27, 2013|All hotel restaurants should be....|4|"All hotel restaurants should be this good! Very impressed. We were in a rush to make a performance of ""Wicked"" at the Providence Theater. Our waiter was totally on top of things and got us out the door in perfect time. We would return for sure if in the area again."
December 18, 2013|Good place to dine before|5|Good place to dine before attending a show nearby. Food was excellent, service attentive, and conveniently located in downtown Providence.
December 17, 2013|Everything just clicked!|5|Three of my college mates and spouses got together for dinner and a PC bbal game. This had been planned for about two months and despite the weather we forged ahead. I requested a round table for better conversation and it was provided ~ everyone stayed involved in the conversation. Most of us ordered burgers, they were served as requested and very good. Our waitress was very attentive, very patient, and there to answer any questions. We were enjoying ourselves so much we almost decided to forego the game. We would absolutely go again.
December 14, 2013|Good,restaurant, great food|4|Food was delicious. The service was a little slow. The room was a bit cold. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back if I was in the area. Very convenient for a pre- show dinner.
December 13, 2013|Service was slower than usual|2|Service was slower than usual and food was good but not up to past performance and certainly not worth the premiere steakhouse prices. Been there many times before and they can and have done better. Uncharacteristically noisey due to a young girls hockey team there. Wanted a quiet booth which matre d' obliged but hostess was going to seat us at a table near soccer team. We and matre d' fixed that but still too noisey. Wedge salad great and bigger than remembered from past visits. Wife's chicken Milanese not to her liking and covered with greens and said had she known, she would not have ordered a Caesar salad. My fillet was good but not great.
November 23, 2013|nice location next to civic center|2|went to dinner after a Jeff Dunham show at the DD center,very convenient & beautiful environment. Had a reservation seated right away and after 10 minutes finally the waiter came over and took the drink order, didn't see our drinks for another 10 min. after complaining to our waiter things got better and the food was good.
November 9, 2013|great location|5|we enjoyed the meal and the service, and the Dunkin Donuts Center is right next door: great meal, easy walk to the concert
November 9, 2013|Before The Dunk|5|Saw Elton John Show at the Dunk, booked a reservation online the day before, it worked out great. The place was mobbed, i think the staff was a bit overwhelmed but they handles it. It took about 15 minutes after my reservation to get seated, but the service was good and the food came quick. I great pre-show or pre-game stop.
November 9, 2013|Shiula's delivered - again|5|Another excellent dining experience. The restaurant called Saturday morning to confirm our reservation. We had a 6:30 reservation and were a few minutes early. The bar was loaded and the overflow was into the hotel, but we were seated immediately. Service was prompt, friendly, and professional. The food was excellent (entrees were the Seared Ahi Tuna and Chicken Milanese). It was a very busy night in downtown Providence with Water Fire, Elton John next door at the Dunkin' Center (we came for a pre-concert dinner), and Beer Fest. That did not adversely affect the service and quality of the food and the overall experience was what we have experienced in the past. Definitely recommended.
November 9, 2013|Hopping pre-concert restaurant!|4|We went there for dinner before a concert. The server told us immediately that the bar was slammed (which it was) and that the drinks will be a few more moments. We ordered the arugula salad which was HUGE. Thank goodness we only ordered one salad to share! My date ordered the filet mignon medium and I ordered the ahi tuna rare. BOTH came out well done! While we were in a rush, we felt we didn't want to pay the price for a bad meal, so we called the server over. Immediately, she saw that both meals were overcooked, and promised to have replacements out within a few moments. When the meals came out again, they were PERFECT and delicious. This is why I gave this restaurant a 4 stars, otherwise, it would have been a 5!
Dined on November 9, 2013|Great Experience|4|I probably could have given it a outstanding, but the dessert (carrot cake) was a little dry. It sounded like it was going to be this outstanding 5 layer cake, that really wasn't. The ladies had salmon and I had a steak sandwich. Salads and soup first. The meal was excellent and the staff was outstanding. Service was great. It works well if you are going to an event at the Dunkin Center. Short walk and valet parking at the hotel. Easy in and out. I would do it again.
November 9, 2013|Squashed seating|2|We have been to Shula's on a number of occasions and have enjoyed the proximity of the restaurant to the arena where we would be attending a concert or sport event. We always felt the food was very good, and this night was no exception. The service, was adequate. And generally the wait for dinner to arrive was always fairly long. However, on this occasion we had booked for a party of six and were never told that it would be difficult for them to accommodate us. Upon arrival, we were seated in a booth which was very tight and uncomfortable. It was not meant for six average adults. No effort was made to reseat us even as they watched two of our company struggle to stay seated at the open edge of the booth. We will not return.
November 9, 2013|Excellent service and food|5|Great place to have dinner before catching a show, love their steaks.
October 24, 2013|Great Restaurant|5|We enjoyed a delicious steak dinner recently and will definitely return.
October 6, 2013|Texas Roadhouse at a premium price|3|Great for a quiet night out. Steak was ok but not worth the premium price. Dessert was poor quality, size and also overpriced. Drinks and server were good. I felt I still paid too much and I had a coupon for a free entree. This is built for the Hilton guest on an expense account not the local diner. Free Parking for 3 hours was nice. Better to go to another steakhouse unless quiet is what you want.
September 28, 2013|Food was good. Decor is modern|3|Food was good. Decor is modern but comfortable. Don't know if it was an off-night, but for a Saturday (and a Waterfire night) it was VERY quiet.
September 22, 2013|Very Nice Experience|4|As usual, Shula's 347 was a great experience. The food is very good, the wines by the glass are intriguing and the ones I tried were very good, and the wait staff (which I counted at a least 4 people) were very attentive. I'd certainly consider going back again soon!
August 28, 2013|Great as always!|5|Awesome steak. My wife and I always enjoy coming here.
August 27, 2013|Excellent|5|The food was delicious and abundant. Which is a good thing. And I thank you for my Compliementary Birthday Dinner which we celebrated on my BD 8/27
August 6, 2013|Shula's in Providence|4|"Overall, the experience was good. We all had steak and the only disappointment was the ""Cowboy"" steak. Did not meet expectations."
July 27, 2013|Top Notch Steak|4|Been to a number of the big name steakhouses but Shula's has the best steaks!
July 23, 2013|Hotel surprise|4|Hidden within the Providence Hilton is this sleek, modern dining oasis. Quiet on weeknights, the bar offers a scenic view of downtown while the kitchen offers a number of apps, entrees, and desserts, that would satisfy a variety of tastes. This chain is noted for their high quality beef so you can't go wrong with a steak, burger, or ribs choice. There is also an extensive wine and cocktail list. Locals, we come here to celebrate birthdays or other special occasions. Prices are reasonable for the downtown area and the hotel has complimentary valet parking.
July 21, 2013|All around AWESOME!!!!!|5|Mike R. and Chris H. were spectacular!! Food was great and it was an all around great experience!!! Keep up the great work!!
July 12, 2013|solid experience|4|1st time visitor looking to take advantage of Providence Restaurant Week offer. No complaints here. The welcome, drinks, service and food, were all very good.
July 12, 2013|Great steak|5|Top-notch food and service. Very comfortable and inviting. Made my wife's birthday very special.
July 5, 2013|Everything about our dining|5|Everything about our dining experience at Shula's was perfect. The atmospher, service, and food all deserve 5 stars. The hosts and the servers were very friendly and accomodating. I can't wait to go back!
June 28, 2013|Quiet Friday night|4|"First time ever to Shula's. Surprised how few people where in the restaurant, although there were more people in the bar area than the restaurant eating dinner. The wait staff was good, although due to the lack of business, maybe a little too attentive to our needs? I ordered my steak medium well and it came out more on the rare side, so I did have to send it back, but then at the end of the night, they offered two desserts on the house, but I was full, so only my wife took advantage of it. Overall, a good experience, but wonder how they stay in business with such a small ""crowd"" for dinner."
June 8, 2013|Disappointed|3|In what was our first visit and probably last to Shula's we were a little disappointed. The food was overpriced and the service was a little laxed and the restaurant wasn't busy at all...which made the issue worse. For a Saturday night, the place should have been hopping being right in the center of the city and being the only restaurant in the hotel. But it wasn't, which makes me think we are not the only ones who have had a disappointing visit here.
May 18, 2013|Consistently Excellent|5|This was the second time in the past week we ate here. The food is terrific. The first night we dined at Shula's we had a party of 9 everyone raved about the food. The steak is far better than the other steak houses in the area and the seared tuna is perfect. The restaurant isn't busy and I can't understand why because this place is a five star for food, service and atmosphere. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.
May 12, 2013|Mother's Day breakfast|5|My son and I took my wife for breakfast to celebrate the occasion. Service was very good and staff was professional and attentive without hovering.
May 11, 2013|Great Experience|5|Our server was terrific! Her suggestions and recommendations were spot on. Our steaks were as good as any served at the top Chicago steak houses. Overall, a great dining experience!
May 10, 2013|Great Pregame Meal|4|The family had a great meal before the Providence Bruins. We parked in the hotel garage which was close and reasonable. The bar was full but the dining area not so much, so we had a quiet spot next to a big TV. The kids had three helpings of chicken fingers and fries while I had a burger and my wife an entr√©e salad. While it took a little longer than expected to get the meals, every enjoyed their choices and we were out to the game next door in under an hour.
May 3, 2013|Great food and great service.|4|Great food and great service. The only problem is the restaurant is attached to the Hilton hotel an you can get parents with large groups of kids like the cheerleaders on the night we visited.
May 1, 2013|I had to send my steak back|3|I had to send my steak back because it was over cooked.
April 27, 2013|Hotel Restaurant|3|It's a hotel restaurant, and it wouldn't really survive on its own.
April 6, 2013|Restaurant was empty when|5|Restaurant was empty when I arrived. Was very concerned, as I'd read some mixed review in the past. So unfounded... Didn't try the steaks, but individuals in our party had sandwiches and burgers. Fantastic food - not just the entrees, but accompanying sides as well. Very fairly priced. Excellent service. Very convenient to Dunkin Donuts center as well. Would definitely go back. Highly recommended.
March 2, 2013|First time customers. We|4|First time customers. We had a wonderful dinner before the PC vs St John's game at the DDC. This will be our first stop at all future events at the DDC or convention center.
February 26, 2013|Great place to eat before|5|Great place to eat before a concert. Good food and very good service.
February 26, 2013|I knew we were going to be|4|I knew we were going to be in Providence for The Who show. I had recieved a MyPerks.com email for a $50 dinner for $25. Food was great. Waitstaff was very attentive. My son had the ribeye and said it was very good. I had the burger and smashed potatoes and that was delicious as well. Very enjoyable evening.
February 23, 2013|We have visited Shula's on|5|We have visited Shula's on multiple occasions as a couple as well as in a group of several couples and we have never been disappointed. The Hilton offers free valet parking for Shula's which is very convenient. The staff are amazing, food outstanding and the osphere terrific. We will be back!
February 16, 2013|When we arrived they said|2|When we arrived they said that they did not have our reservation,their computer was done. After about 20 minutes we were finally seated. We waited another 20 minutes and then I went to the Maitre'd and asked if we had a waiter or waitress to wait on us. She assured me we did and after waiting another 10 minutes our waiter came over all apologetic. They did comp us a appertizer and beverage which was very nice. The food as always was excellent. I would definite go back, just one of their off nights. It was a special occasion and just wanted everything to be perfect. The steak is so worth the wait!
February 16, 2013|Give your review a title (optional)|5|The reservation never went through even though I had a confirmation email so they took 10% off the bill. Very nice and they were able to accomdate us on a busy Saturday night.
January 28, 2013|We grabbed burgers before|5|We grabbed burgers before the AHL Allstar game. Service was excellent and our food arrived quickly and cooked as asked. It looks like they can handle the quick and easy bar food customers as well as the customers who want a fine dining experience, all in a relatively small space. Will go again soon!
January 19, 2013|Terrible service on a Saturday|3|Wait staff was horrible. Never received bread, had long wait between courses...no utensils. Need more wait staff.
January 13, 2013|The food is always excellent.|5|The food is always excellent. The service has always been great.
January 12, 2013|This was our second time here.|3|This was our second time here. The back room is very noisy. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed. She did not come to our table once we were seated for close to five minutes. When she took our order we ordered a salad to share and two entree's. After waiting about 15 minutes for our salad, I stopped her to see where it was and she said she would check. She finally brought it to us. My wife had requested pasta in lieu of mashed potatoes when she gave her order and the waitress said fine. When her entree was delivered it came with mashed potato's. We told the waitress and she said she would get the pasta which she did. Overall we were disappointed in the service and found the food to be ok, but nothing exceptional.
December 31, 2012|The service was excellent.|5|The service was excellent. The atmosphere was great. The food was great. I would recommend to anybody
November 27, 2012|Pre-Game Meal|4|Went for a pre-game (at the Dunkin Donuts arena next door) meal. Service was good as was food.
November 3, 2012|OVERPRICED CAN GET BETTER|2|OVERPRICED CAN GET BETTER FOOD IN THE AREA FOR MUCH LOWER PRICES
October 27, 2012|Although the steak was excellent,|3|Although the steak was excellent, the mashed potatoes were on the cool side and the seasonal vegetables were not cooked enough. I originally ordered stead and two vegetables but I received the steak and asparagus and mashed potatoes that were cool. They immediately replaced the mashed potatoes and I told them to forget about the seasonal vegetables. However, a few minutes they brought the vegetables along with the warm mashed potatoes. We have always had good luck with Shula's; however, the asparagus was excellent but the seasonal vegetables (very large cut carrots and a few pieces of summer squash) were lacking.
Dined on October 12, 2012|Steaks were very good, restaurant|2|Steaks were very good, restaurant lacks ambiance and any kind of identity. The waiter service was young and very inexperienced. For a high end steak house, I would have to rate it as a poor overall experience.
October 9, 2012|Great service. The mushroom|5|Great service. The mushroom ravioli was so yummy that I ate it twice in the same week!
September 29, 2012|The only good thing about|1|The only good thing about this resturant is location (close to Dunkin Donuts center). Food was fair at best and service was terrible. Would not recomend.
September 24, 2012|When we arrived, no one was|5|When we arrived, no one was there. We were treated like royalty by the staff and management.
September 20, 2012|Save your money!|3|One persons seasonal vegetables were to oily to eat. My cheese burger was burnt on one side which the cover with the cheese to hide the mistake. I ordered it cooked medium. You can not hide the taste of burnt food! The last person was happy with the Shula Club sandwich. She said it was delicious. We share the calamari fries we thought the were very good. The second day of our Convention two of us returned because it was close by. Sometimes you hit a bad day. We both ordered the soup of the day beef stew and two apps to share. When the waiter brought the stew out we thought we had the wrong soup. It looked like a vegetable soup. Thin orange in color you had to search for a few tiny pieces of beef. Crab caked were delicious but cold.
September 18, 2012|I was veru disappointed in|3|I was veru disappointed in the steak, For $35 dollars i would expect a steak with some flavor and not alot of rubbery fat. My steak had zero flavor and lots of rubber like fat.Also, it was 8 o'clock at night and they were out of baked potatoes. REALLY?
September 8, 2012|Awesome Dinning Experience|5|Best dinning experience we ever had!!! We choose Shula's for our 15 year anniversary, based on personal recommendations and online reviews, and we were completely blown away by the entire dinning experience. When I made the reservation we noted that it was our anniversary and from the moment that we arrived at Shula's the staff and management made our evening feel so special. You could tell they spent time prior to our arrival on planning our evening; from our table location (unbelievable), level of service, to a special message on our dessert plate, everything was done tastefully and with class. The meal was equally as impressive, I would recommend Shula's to everyone and we will be back!!!!
August 31, 2012|First time visit. Seated|4|First time visit. Seated promptly. Very professional waiter. Extensive wine list. Surf & Turf with Filet Mignon and Shrimp was very good. Shrimp was outstanding!
August 18, 2012|Food and service was great.|5|Food and service was great. What was weird is there were only about 15 people in the entire restaurant. I personally dont care for a booth when I'm on a date since we are talking accross from each other. I noticed that there were no tables in the restaurant.
August 7, 2012|Highly recommend|5|Top of the line steak house. Food and service great all around. We will be back.
August 6, 2012|Shulas|4|Shulas is always a safe bet. Food is good and its not quiet as pricey as say a Ruths Chris.
August 5, 2012|Went for a quiet dinner. Shortly|5|Went for a quiet dinner. Shortly after being seated a group of five with a crying baby was being seated right behind us. The manager was on the spot and offerred them a bigger table in the back. We did have a quiet dinner. Congrats to fast thinking manager.
August 3, 2012|My husband and I went to Shula's|5|My husband and I went to Shula's 347 to celebrate my husband's birthday. The restaurant was excellent! The atmosphere was great - not too loud and very clean! We both had filet mignon and it was the best steak dinner we've ever had. We've been to many steak places throughout the state, but this was by far the best! The service was superb and one of the things we noticed is that the manager's attentiveness to the diners was exceptional. He was very concerned about our dining experience and helped to make it the best for us! He helped bring out the entrees, clean the tables and managed to ask each diner about their individual experience at the restaurant. I feel that deserves an A+.
July 30, 2012|Not only was the food all|5|Not only was the food all of what we expected, we visited the one in lake Mary last year, the waiter was a pleasure and a great credit to your company. We will return even though we have resturants closer to home and you are an hour drive. Keep up the good team work.
July 26, 2012|So so|2|Slow night when we dined. One steak overcooked and the other done right. Both ordered at same temp. Disappointing wine list. Better steak restaurant choices within walking distance from Schulas
July 21, 2012|A Waterfire delight|5|We've been at Shula's multiple times. My wife had a coupon for a free entree for her birthday and we were going to Waterfire down the street anyway, so took advantage of the coupon. The service was excellent, got the free entree and they even threw in her dessert for free. My wife had the seared ahi tuna and said it was one of the best she's had ever. I had the small filet and it was cooked to perfection. I took the seasonal veggie and turned out to be corn on the cob which was just sweet and delicious. Shula's covers 3 hours of parking free and so we got to park there for Waterfire when it is usually just a zoo parking around there. Just a great, relaxing, enjoyab;e evening thanks to Shula's.
June 16, 2012|The food at Shula's 347 is|4|The food at Shula's 347 is always outstanding, especially their filet. I love this place because you can go casual and have a choice of casual food or their top of the line steaks / seafood. They always have a great wine selection. My only complaint about this particular visit is that they served the entrees way too quick. We weren't even done with our appetizers and felt rushed which shouldn't have been the case given the restaurant was very quiet.
June 9, 2012|Nice Suprise|5|This was a great suprise, the decor was simple and sophisticated,they seated us quickly and everyone was very friendly. It was clean and comfortable. For a chain restaurant the food was excellent. There is a very cool bar area over-looking the city.
June 2, 2012|The last time we went to Shula's|5|The last time we went to Shula's the service was atrocious however, the food was still good. This time everyting was excellent!!! Looking forward to going again.
May 26, 2012|Compared to nearby local restaurant|3|Compared to nearby local restaurants, the food was only fair to good. The experience was not bad, but it was not memorable either.
May 19, 2012|Food was excellent,service|3|Food was excellent,service needs improvement. Barely saw our waitress and when we did she was occupied with her other tables....however when she came to our table she was personable and friendly....a lot of wait time before our appetizer,dinner,and desert orders were taken....all of the food was excellent...if you want great food go to Shula's, if you want good service you will need to go elsewhere....
May 19, 2012|The food and service is great.|4|The food and service is great. The staff goes out of their way to please the patrons.
April 28, 2012|Shula's was probably the worst|2|"Shula's was probably the worst dining experience I've had at a ""steak house"". The service was terrible considering the extravagant prices. If I wasn't hungry and the food wasn't great my husband and I would have walked out. Not a good experience. Would not reccomend."
April 24, 2012|Good food great service.|5|Good food great service. Somewhat of a limited menu.
April 8, 2012|Great dining in Providence|4|"This is the second time we've been to Shula's and the food was wonderful, again. It seems we tend to go there during ""off peak"" hours (Sunday evenings, both times, after bringing our son back to college in Providence), so it's been quiet. But the bar looks like it is probably a good hit for Happy Hour on other days. The steaks are perfect and the sides are creative and delicious. The smashed potatoe, baked potatoe, french fries and asparagus were our favorites. The kids had burgers, which were also very good. Key lime pie, even if you are already stuffed, is worth every mouthful. Share it with someone if you have to! The decor is sports related, with a smart casual feel and relaxing. Staff is very attentive & professional."
April 6, 2012|Definitely not great food...and|2|Definitely not great food...and quite expensive for the mediocre food. Steak was just OK, shrimp were overdone, and crabcakes were tasteless. Not planning to return.
March 9, 2012|way tooo overprioced for fair|3|way tooo overprioced for fair and average food. they had Kraft mac & cheese, really? for $8, ugh, cold chicken and small, small portions on the over $30 steaks. the baked potato was twice as large as the staek.
February 14, 2012|Heard mixed reviews. Food|5|Heard mixed reviews. Food was delicious and my girl was happy too..enough said. Would def go back
February 14, 2012|Jenifer|5|We found Shula's to be a great atmosphere with friendly and good service. The entrees were delicious and Management was very accomodating to us, having a special diet. Very happy with our expeirience and hope to visit again!
January 27, 2012|Just OK|2|Nothing special. Food was ok at best. They wouldn't let me use my coupon because there was a concert going on in the city...but the place wasn't near full. Will not go back.
January 19, 2012|I have been to Shula's 347|5|I have been to Shula's 347 Grille a number of time and everytime the food and the service has been outstanding. would recommend it to everyone. It's a little expensive but worth it and especially good for special occasions.
January 14, 2012|Wait staff was quick with|1|Wait staff was quick with drinks, appetizers and salads, but we had to wait one hour and fifteen minutes for our entrees. Obviously our meals were forgotten or the waitress forget to place the order. When we finally questioned her about our food she said it would be right out, 30 minutes later it appeared, over cooked and died out. We should have gone to the Cheese Cake Factory right down the street, but we thought Shula's would be upscale, boy were we surprised.
January 14, 2012|Food took almost and hour|1|Food took almost and hour to get, and we just ordered sandwiches. We did not see our waiter from the time we ordered until after the food was served, Never came to offer another drink, etc.Waiter said the kitchen was backed up. It was a Saturday night, what did they expect? They are located inside a Hilton,next to the Dunkin Donuts Center. It would not be a first that they would be busy on a Saturday night. No sign of management
January 13, 2012|Good for Dunk events, otherwise no|2|Nothing Special about Shula's. Convenient place to go before an event at the Dunk. Have dined there 3 or 4 times. Service is personable but often slow. The food the last two times arrived sporadicly and getting drinks from the bar seemed to take forever. One particular thing that was a negative from last visit was the a glass of wine was served to us in a hot glass. So go if you want convenience to the Dunk, otherwise there are better choices.
January 13, 2012|Food was great but price was|3|Food was great but price was high. Not a great food value. Our server was excellent.
January 10, 2012|Mike I|5|Food and service were excellent. Its a tad pricey but not as expensive as Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris. I have been a few times and every time it has been good.
January 7, 2012|A nice night out|4|The food was tasty- but probably not something I will remember 6 months from now. The ambiance is quite lovely, a great date spot. Our waiter was very friendly, and bordered on overly attentive, but I would certainly prefer that to the other extreme. The restaurant was surprisingly empty for a Saturday night, but it is January. Complimentary valet parking was a nice touch.
January 6, 2012|We had the Cowboy Rib steak|5|We had the Cowboy Rib steak and it was very flavorfull. It was served with a starch and vegtable. Our service was exceptional.

Dined on December 3, 2011|We would not go back. My|2|We would not go back. My husband had to send his steak back. He ordered it medium, and it came to the table rare. It took so long to finish broiling his steak, I was nearly finished. I had the filet mignon, which was great- but the asparagus and garlic parm fires that accompanied it were not piping hot. When we got the bill, we noticed we were charged $19 for a $10 martini! Also- for a Saturday night- it was not busy at all- you could easily have walked in without a reservation.
November 25, 2011|Utterly disappointed!|1|We had tickets to go see a concert and made our reservations for 6:30. We arrived early and was seated at 6:15. It took a few minutes for our waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink. It didn't take long for our drinks to arrive, we than placed an order for an appetizer. We also told the waitress that we needed to be out by 7:50 the latest because of the concert. It took a while for the appetizer. We ended up getting it around 7:00. We than ordered dinner. We waited..waited. Finally arrived at 7:40. We literally had 10 minutes to eat our food. We ate as fast as we could, while eating we asked our waitress for the check. My boyfriends burger was overcooked and my salad was mediocre. I couldn't even finish my $12 drink.
November 25, 2011|Seriously disappointing|1|Disappointing doesn't begin to describe our experience. While they didn't appear to be busy (many tables empty), the waitress was harried, didn't come back to check how our meals were and the server wandered around with our meals checking with several tables before bringing them to us. NY Strip was terrible - for a $34 plate, I expected more. No subs allowed - I didn't want potatoes or the veg of the day, just a salad -- wouldn't substitute, so I got a inedible steak on a plate that I carved off the charred outer layer to eat the meat within (ordered med rare). Caesar salad was awash in dressing and cheese and just as poor quality -
November 12, 2011|Went in expecting an expensive|5|Went in expecting an expensive meal (Just looking for a great steak) - had been to Shulas in Naples, FL = pleasantly surprised to find the prices more affordable and a big more extensive menu. The Ahi Tuna was to die for!!!! Will be back soon
September 24, 2011|Mediocre|3|Slow service. Took the waiter almost 15 minutes to deliver 3 Martinis and one glass of merlot. Dinner was delivered with green beans instead of asparagus as advertised. Food was OK. Nothing to rave about. Even with a complimentary appetizer the prices were high in comparison to what we received. Waiter, although slow and marginally attentive, was nice. The only thing that got delivered on a timely basis was the bill. I'll give Shula's another try when I'm in Providence for a game or concert at The Dunk.
August 20, 2011|First time to Shula's. Two|4|"First time to Shula's. Two of us had fish. Excellent. One of us had steak. Also excellent. The service was excellent. Only complaint is the servers ""checked in"" with us too often. Once we have said everything is good and we don't need anything else, we like to be left alone."

July 16, 2011|5 Star Service|5|We dined at Shula's on Saturday, July 16. We loved the restaurant, but the service we received by our waitress was what really set Shula's apart from any other restaurant. She was attentive, helpful, friendly, and prompt. The food was delicious.

Salads out in a timely manner but main course a little slow. Dessert wait was at least 15 -20 minutes which was surprising since there was only one other occupied table in restaurant. I can't imagine how long the wait would be if it was busy. The lobster and steak were very tasty.

June 10, 2011|Great for a birthday!|5|"The food here was absolutely amazing. The servers were very attentive and the manager came over to make sure we were enjoying our food. I took my mother here for her birthday and it was an enjoyable occasion! It was a little pricy for an ""everyday meal"", but great for a special occasion!"
May 27, 2011|Went there on a quiet Friday|3|"Went there on a quiet Friday night - hardly any customers. That said, the service should have been better. Meal was great. When I am at a ""top notch"" steak house, I expect every facet of the meal to be top notch. There are just too many good steakhouses in Providence to settle for less."
April 22, 2011|Bar area was pleasant and|2|Bar area was pleasant and nice for pre-dinner cocktails. Host was pleasant/welcoming. Waitstaff lacked in attention to detail in both what was ordered and additional items requested (silverware, drinks, etc.) Was very disappointed after my first experience at Shula's in Ft.

January 29, 2011|My husband & I were looking|2|My husband & I were looking forward to participating in Providence Restaurant Week as it's a great way to try new restaurants. We chose Shula's because they had great options for the limited menu. Our server was great, but there were many things that lacked in our meal. My husband's steak wasn't cooked as he ordered it and our sides were luke warm. The worst part came with dessert: we ordered Carrot Cake and it was delivered to us still partially frozen. The server and manager apologized, brought us a new dessert, but it still put a damper on an already mediocre meal. Prices aside from the special menu were pretty high (drinks and such), so we probably could have had a better meal for the same price elsewhere.
January 22, 2011|Was a suprise how enjoyable|5|Was a suprise how enjoyable the evening was. Food was hot, cooked to perfections, and wait staff was outstanding. Would recommend to anyone.

December 31, 2010|This was our first visit to|5|This was our first visit to Shula's for New Year's Eve 5:30 reservations. We were greeted kindly, although our reservation was not listed. Not sure why because I had a confirmation email in my hand. It was not busy so we were seated immediately at a spacious booth with plenty of room for the four of us. Two burgers, prime rib, and crab legs were our choices. The food was presented nicely and portions were not skimpy. Our server was very friendly and helpful. We were not rushed and had plenty of time to get to our 8:00 show. We even got a visit from the executive chef who shared some stories with us. Overall, it was a very pleasant dining expereince.

October 30, 2010|Overall, the experience was|4|Overall, the experience was very good. The grilled asparagus was good but the quantity was very small. The grilled shrimp plate was very good. I had a cowboy steak, Pittsburg rare. Cooked right. Waitress service was quick and professional. Check it out if you have not been. However, this restaurant is not a true Shula's Steak House, a la Miami or Naples. Those are high end steak places. Providence is more of 99s or Outback but with a nice lounge area. PMR
October 8, 2010|As always with Shula's, the|3|As always with Shula's, the food is to die for and the service is awful. If this place could get on the ball with the service, they would be a top notch establishment. I frequent the place because its close to the Dunkin Donuts Center and the food is good, but I would go elsewhere if not for the convenience. We visited late, 930 reservations. There was about 3 other parties in the place. We ordered the chowder, which was good, but we waited, and waited. Finally the waiter noticed we didnt have it and went to get it. Then we had the NY strip, both were cooked to perfection, tender and tasty. However, we still didnt have silverware. They werent busy, no excuse. They really need to get a clue, I suspect its the reason it was so empty.
September 25, 2010|Shula's is off the lobby of|4|Shula's is off the lobby of the Providence Hilton, which make it an interesting mix of casual and serious. There are many quiet tables, but you can also sit at the round bar watching sports. Even at the smaller tables, you can have a TV nearby switched to your favorite station. The food is American with some creative twists. Meat quality is very high (especially steaks). The sauces are on the hearty side, which works well with burgers, beef, etc. Portions are very large. The service is fabulous -- friendly, concerned, attempting to meet whatever special wish you might have.
August 14, 2010|My wife and I live locally|2|"My wife and I live locally and were staying at the Hilton Providence attached to Shulas. We thought it would be convenient to get a steak at Shulas as opposed to walking to Federal Hill. The service was excellent. The bartenders, hostess and waitress were incredible and very attentive to all of our needs. The atmosphere was unnecessarily busy and more suited for a sports bar than an upscale steak restaurant. The food was spotty. Our steaks were cooked with precision but the quality of the steak, the ""Cowboy Cut"", was subpar. On the other hand, the side dishes and appetizers were a suprising treat. Since we went to the restaurant primarily for its steaks though, I would rate our experience as average making the pricing a concern."
August 7, 2010|Really lacked professional|2|Really lacked professional service. the server was nice but probibly came by ten times to ask how we were doing... little too much... she needs some professional training. Food ok, thats all. drinks good. Although we ordered drinks and I got mine husband did not and she asked if we weee ready to order dinner? I had martini and she walked away with the left overs and never asked about rocks on the side.... train your servers please.

When Rest. Week started I decided to give them another chance...Big Mistake !. The staff is awful. We had 2 people waiting on us who never communicated with each other. We wanted the rest.week special (Soup, meal & dessert)and we ordered an app. We were almost done with our app and the meal comes...NO SOUP...I called the waitress over and explained we didnt get the soup...Oh sorry (no offer to take it to go) and then the waiter came over and said asked if we wanted the check, so my friend said ""didn't this come with dessert ?"" his response ""oh some people don't want it""..Shouldn't he have asked ??"

April 23, 2010|We went here for the first|4|"We went here for the first time. In my mind it's always been a place for a drink before or after a PC game but we don't think of it other times. Had time constrictions for TRINITY so went here because it was close. Sadly, place was empty at 6:30 Friday night. Perhaps two other tables and half dozen people at bar. Whole city was dead with Trinity the only draw. Able to park on street. OK Now, we found the food very good. Unlike other ""steak houses, my moderately priced, done to perfection tenderloin came with giant baked potato and, probably, the best asparagus I've ever had. Many interesting wines by the glass. Wonderful waitress. Understandably quick service. So, my mind now sees Shula's as a destination in itself and we will return"

Food was ok, nothing great. We have had much better at other Shula's. This was the only place we could get in on Valentines Weekend tho, on short notice.
January 28, 2010|I had one of the best steaks|4|I had one of the best steaks of my life at Shula's and the price was not to be believed. They had a special going on where for $29.95, I had an 8 oz filet mignon, ceasar salad, two sides (I selected smashed red bliss potatoes and asparagus with a light balsamic vinagrette sauce) and a generous slice of cheescake for dessert. My husband had an equally wonderful meal. We are so glad we found this place and we will be back to visit Shula's again in the future.

It was cooked perfectly, was so tender my son was cutting it with his butter knife, and tasted like heaven. My son ordered a sprite, they brought him a ginger ale. He ordered his mashed potato without parm cheese, he got them with cheese. I always go back for the food, but the service could improve. our server was friendly and nice, just not very detail oriented. This was our 4th visit, and it's always the same.

All the food was excellent. The only reason I didn't give five stars was that the portions were far too large. Don, my waiter, was personable and knowledgeable. I can't comment on the special features.

The seafood special, halibut, was ordered grilled and it was absolutely perfectly done and delicious. The NY Strip was ordered medium, but arrived medium rare -- closer to rare.

Lastly, we receieved two chocolate covered stawberries, compliments of Shula's...an unexpected surprise. We took them home and ate them for breakfast the next morning. All and all, we enjoy our meal, and would visit Shula's again.
February 14, 2009|Steaks were excellent as promised.|4|"Steaks were excellent as promised. My husband and I would rate them in the ""top 5"" steaks we've ever had. A little pricey, but it IS in down town Providence, so compared to other area restaurants the price is comparable. I'd definately go back, there were a few other things on the menu a little less pricey that I want to try. I'd recommend trying Shula's at least once. The bar area looked fun, and overlooks the entrance to the Dunkin Donuts center arena, would like to have a drink there, it looks like an interesting spot. Can't wait to go back."
February 14, 2009|We were going to a basketball|1|We were going to a basketball game at the Dunkin Donuts Arena at 7pm. The hostess asked us if we were going to the game when we arived at 5:45PM. The waitress also asked us if we were going to the game She said no problem. We were a party of 5. we ordered 4 burgers and a grilled cheese. Our food did not arrive until 6:50pm (10 minutes before the game was to begin) The burgers were not cooked as ordered. One which was supposed to be medium was very very rare. Because we did not have time to return it to the kitchen, it was not eaten. The waitress was pleasant but ineffective after repeated concerns voiced by us about the long wait and our fear of missing the beginning of the game.
February 14, 2009|Our dining experience was|5|Our dining experience was excellent. The hostess allowed us to sit in a very comfortable booth with a big screen TV close by. Our waitress, Kristen, was most attentative and took care of each of our requests. The maitre'd visited our booth and we had an informative and enlightening conversation with him (Bob Silva). As noted above the service was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. This was our third experience at Shula's 347 Grille in the last month and we would highly recommend this to anyone planning to visit downtown Providence!!!!! It is the perfect place for anyone attending an event at the Dunkin Donuts Center or the Providence Convention Center.
February 14, 2009|After having attended Shula's|1|"After having attended Shula's steakhouse in Orlando, my wife and I were thrilled to book Shula's 347 for our Valentine's Day dinner. You can imagine our shock when we were given cold side dishes (twice), an overcooked piece of meat, and were seated near a really rude woman who depicted ""show mom"" to her cheerleader daughter. In all, this is NOTHING like the classy restaurant we would have expected based on previous Shula experiences. If not for an outstanding bartender and server, this would have been a complete flop of a meal."
February 13, 2009|Shula's 347 was not what I|2|Shula's 347 was not what I expected. It was more of a Hotel restautant than a (Steakhouse). They had only 3 Steaks on the menu a Filet & a Cowboy steak (a ribeye) and a Strip Steak. The menu centered mainly around lunch-sandwiches. The Steaks were OK, the martini was good, I won't be running back there.

December 31, 2008|My husband and I went to Shula's|4|My husband and I went to Shula's in Orlando a few yeras back. When I made the reservation in Providence, I thought it was the same place, but was told that Shula's has steakhouses and grilles. The grilles such as Providence are much more casual, more of a sports bar. Although the atmosphere was not what we were looking for on New Year's Eve (the one that we had in the steakhouse in Orlando), the food and service were excellent. I'd go back again wearing jeans and not on a special occasion.
December 31, 2008|We had a great dinner at Shulas|4|We had a great dinner at Shulas 347. We all had steak (not a given since there are only three steak choices on the menu) and enjoyed our meals. We lamented the lack of mushrooms or other sauces for the steaks but it didn't ruin the meal. I also wish they offered Prime Rib - they had a sandwich offered with prime rib, but not that cut of meat for a meal. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the waitress asked us to check the doneness when she delivered them. The starchy sides were tasty but the veggies sides were limited. The tomato and mozzarella chop salad looked unlike any I've had - but VERY delicious - highly recommended! I think we expected more beef choices from a steak house - but we enjoyed what we had!
December 29, 2008|This was the second time we|4|This was the second time we visited Shula's 347, and it was very good. We had visited on the opening weekend, and the service at that time was spotty, I think it was our waiters first day! This visit was much better, service wise. We had cesear salads for starters, and the dressing was the fresh made! I much prefer the fresh made to a bottle, and would have liked the anchoives but you usually dont get them. I had the 14 oz ny strip, my wife had the fresh fish selection, which was swordfish on this date. My steak was ordered medium rare and was cooked perfect. During the fist visit they had me cut open the steak and check the doneness, but not this time. The swordfish was expertly prepared, grilled to a light brown and very tender.

Prices were reasonable with a good mix of expensive steaks with cheaper priced dinners to even cheaper sandwiches. Needs some more ""bar-type"" apps, ie. anything fried.

It was my first time ever going to a steakhouse where sauteed mushrooms were not on the menu. Also, it would help if the plates the steaks were served on were warmed up in advance. Steaks were just fine but for the same price you seem to get much more of a total experience at a typical Morton's or Ruth Chris or Smith & Wolensky's.

My family was in from out of town and I wanted to take them to a nice restaurant and Ruth's Chris was booked until 10pm. At this point I wished I had just waited until 10 because the service ruined our dining experience. We waited 25 minutes when we got there to have someone take our drinks, but instead of taking our drinks she proceeded to drill my parents on why they choose Shulas. What the heck was that about? After that our waitress could not recall the specials, informed us that they were out of all the steaks on the menu and then did not know how to explain what a Kansas City or a Porter House cut meats were, despite being the only things left for my dad

The food quality was outstanding, everything was so fresh and cooked perfectly. The 8oz Fillet Mignon was the best beef I have ever had. We had the crispy ravioli for an appetizer and I would go back again just for that! It was amazing. The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was great. We were there early in the evening, so it was quiet and very comfortable.

I had to ask one of the waitresses if she knew who would be waiting on us. She waited on us and after one hour of sitting, I asked the Maitre'D where our food was. He promptly asked the wait staff to check on our food. Although the filet mignon for 2 of the guests was overcooked (nobody came to ask if everything was OK until most of the meal was done) and 1 guest didn't receive her beans instead of vegetables, the overall taste, presentation and price were fine. The kitchen needs to have better return time, the staff needs to be attentive to its guests and the tables/chairs need to be thoroughly wiped down before new guests arrive.

Shula's 347 Grille in Providence is just fantastic, with the food measuring up to the ""parent"" restaurant with ease. Our server, Kelly, was incredible - seriously! Normally we are surprised to see the server appear more than once during dinner. In this case it was somehow as if we were her only table, though she did have several others (even attentive to our 4-year old daughter's needs). If you like steak, go to Shula's 347. The New York Strip was beyond description in taste; aged and cooked to perfection."

We were heading to a concert right at the DD Center for 8 we did not get our appetizer until about 7:25 mind you we arrived at the restaurant early around 6:10 and was seated by our 6:30 reservation. We didn't even get to place our drinkorder until about 7:10. Our server was excellant and apologetic. The manager did come to our table but with waiting so long and being a little irritated you think he would have offered to take something off the bill we spent about 200.00 that night the gesture would have been appreciated and shown that the concern for his customers was there. Regardless we enjoyed dinner and hope to go back with little concern or dismay
April 10, 2008|Our entire experience was|2|Our entire experience was awful.........clearly they were not staffed for the volume of customers: they were out of the first two beers ordered and then had to change the keg on the third. The cheese on the salad had been frozen and had no taste, waiters kept bringing other 's food to our table and ours to another table: The cole slaw was diced so finely it was uneatable and also warm. The french fries with my steak were one inch long and also cold. We were on a way to a concert and this dining experience started the evening off in a very unsatisfying way. We have eaten at Shula's in the past and it was ok: but unless they have a total reorganizattion, they are not going to compete with the other fine steak houses in Providence.
