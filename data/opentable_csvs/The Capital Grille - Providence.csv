ays ago|CAPITAL GRILL NIGHT OUT|4|Food was good but like the old restuarant atmosphere was much better.

February 27, 2016|Top Steak house|4|This was the second time in 2 months we dined at Capital Grille , both times were special occasions (50th birthday celebrations) The food , service, ambiance were all top notch. It was such a great experience both times. My thirteen year old daughter absolutely loved it. The only misgiving is the cost , it is at the high end of $$$$ which limits going there to special occasions
February 25, 2016|Just Ok Lunch Experience|3|First time visiting the new location and was happy with the water views and sleek modern layout. Greeted warmly , seated promptly, nice server engagement. As it was a business lunch, ordered their signature cheeseburger while colleague had caesar salad with grilled shrimp which he enjoyed. Unfortunately the burger was underwhelming, cooked closer to medium -well vs the medium requested... liked the handcrafted aspect of the burger but it appeared too small for the bun! Lightly grilled onion on top with tomato along with very thin slice of cheddar was it for topping if you offer grilled onions then actually grill it as it was translucent:'(. Tasted decent but left hungry. Fries were tasty but a little on the salty side. For almost $20 was expecting more. Will try something else next time.

February 21, 2016|not my favorite|3|Service was extremely poor. Bread came way after food. There are many better places to visit in Providence. Will not be my choice again unless it's a work group dinner.
February 20, 2016|Consistent with Capital Grille expectations|4|This location was similar to any other Capital Grille - the steaks were perfectly prepared to order. The macaroni & cheese was the highlight - delicious. The restaurant was very busy but not too loud. The waiter was a bit awkward at times, but he was attentive.
February 19, 2016|Best steak in town!|5|Best steak in town!
February 19, 2016|My experience at the Capital Grille|5|The Capital Grille is a very nice, upscale dining experience. The steaks are excellent, the staff extremely knowledgeable and attentive, and the ambiance is great! I would highly recommend the Capital Grille to anyone who wishes a fine dining experience.
February 17, 2016|30th Birthday Lunch|5|Our server Joe was amazing!!! Great service makes a simple lunch extraordinary. Kudos to Joe!
February 15, 2016|Capital Grille Experience|5|The whole experience was outstanding . The food, ambiance, and service were all that could be expected of the Capital Grille. The one down note was that the valet turned on my headlights from their automatic setting causing me to wake to a dead battery the next morning.
February 15, 2016|Restaurant is superior; service is poor|4|It may have been the Monday lunch hour, but the service staff was simply not engaged. The restaurant was nearly empty, but still it took forever for our waiter to take our order; for the food to come; for the plates to be cleared - even for the bill to be presented. The food was very good, but not spectacular. Prices are moderate.
February 14, 2016|It was Valentines Day, so they wanted tu...|4|It was Valentines Day, so they wanted turnover to be quick. We ordered Scallops and my husband ordered Tuna. It was ok, but we should have ordered steak I think. Dining room was very comfortable, bar area was very nice. Reservations were kept ontime. Very nice, I just think we ordered the wrong food. I also think they are over priced. Ruth Chris was very expensive, and they are not there anymore.....
February 14, 2016|Always Top Notch!|5|My wife and I visited for Valentines Day. The table had rose petals and small heart shaped confetti type decorations on the while table linens. Always a class act. We enjoyed a number of appetizers, our entree's and some wine. The food is always superb. Wait staff are true attentive professionals. We had a wonderful time.
February 14, 2016|Valentine dinner|5|Great service, great food and great way to celebrate Valentine's Day!

February 13, 2016|Amazing food, great service!|5|The coconut cream pie is life changing! I had the tomato mozzarella salad, filet, creamed spinach, and scalloped potatoes. They are literally to die for! The food is always so good! Everything is made fresh in house, down to the cookie on the coconut cream pie.
February 13, 2016|almost always good|5|Ken is always amazing. We usually gives 5 star reviews because of him. The food was good but my steak was overcooked which I understand because it was valentines day. The 2 things that made me most upset was the fact that It took 20 minutes for us to get to the valet. We were waiting inline 20 minutes just to park our car. Second We wrapped 2 steaks because we got apps and could not finish all of our food. When we got home only one of the steaks and none of our sides made it into the bag. The Capital Grill is usually our favorite place to go. Ken was still awesome and it was a fun night. I was mad that we paid for a steak we did not get (all of)
February 13, 2016|Over-Hyped|2|Went Saturday night before Valentines day. #1 accident downtown, not Capitol Grille's fault but every reservation was backed up at least 30 minutes. We sat at 8 for our 7. Other tables had hearts and red confetti on the table, not us. Waiter really did not give us his full attention. Only the filet was worth any of the a la cart pricing. Fiancee had the chicken which she said was almost not edible. Sides are cooked in a funky flavored oil. For much less money, CAV is the place.
February 13, 2016|Excellent restaurant|5|The food was excellent cooked exactly as we liked it. Our waiter was Mark Deland , he was first class and made our night very enjoyable, and the view of the city was wonderful. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, just be prepared because it is a little pricey but worth it.
February 12, 2016|reservation was changed by the restauran...|3|"reservation was changed by the restaurant I had 9:15PM they pushed me back to 1/2 an hour..we just sat in the lounge area.Food was really good service was solid Hostess ""seemed"" stuck up..."
February 12, 2016|DownHill...Not the Value for Money|2|It was my wife & I anniversary dinner...+$350 dinner you would expect better food. And not asking for the wine you ordered when the plates hit the table. We go out a lot & were looking for a high end experience -- like Maloney & Porcelli of NYC but in Providence. We were at the Grille in old location & it seemed more high-end & better quality then. Our servicer was a nice guy but he had ton of tables on a very busy night....
February 12, 2016|Treat yourself as frequently as possible!|5|The food is wonderful: the steaks can't be beat, but I had a pork chop on Saturday night, and it was the best I'd ever eaten. It was difficult for me to order something other than a steak, but I'm happy I did.
February 12, 2016|Fabulous Steakhouse|5|A great steakhouse to visit a few times each year. The food is fabulous!
February 12, 2016|Just as we expected.|5|We had been to the Capital Grille in Boston and expected nothing less than a great meal, attentive service and a memorable evening. The restaurant delivered on all three counts. Loved it!
February 6, 2016|Great birthday dinner!|5|The food was great. The waiter was outstanding. Highly recommend!!
February 5, 2016|Birthday celebration|5|We celebrated my daughters birthday. The nice touches, rose pedals on table, a sample appetizer and the desert were all great touches. These things made the night feel special ! Only negative is they didn't have my Malbec!
February 3, 2016|Anniversary Dinner|5|When I made my OpenTable reservation for The Capital Grille and let them know it was an anniversary dinner, I had no idea just how special they would make it for us! From the handwritten card and confetti on the table and the champagne toast to the delicious dessert platter that ended our romantic meal, the staff went above and beyond to make it a night to remember. On top of that, the food was simply outstanding.
February 3, 2016|The new location is beautiful. Much larg...|5|The new location is beautiful. Much larger bar area. What can say the food, service and ambiance is always top notch. We have never had a bad experience there.

January 29, 2016|First Time in Providence|5|My wife and I travelled to Providence for a long weekend getaway. We wanted to dine at a nice restaurant, but Providence is inundated with highly reviewed restaurants and we chose The Capital Grille. Wow! The moment you walk in one knows there are high expectations. The ambience, the patrons, and the staff complemented the experience. Every part of our meal, including, drinks, were uniquely remarkable. Our waitress, Meaghan Lombard, had a command of her service and amiable personality. Superb choice!
January 26, 2016|Good but...|4|Overall, the Grille is great. You typically can't beat the quality/level of service, the food and the atmosphere. My most recent experience left me wondering if they were slightly understaffed. It took about 7-10 min for the server to greet us. We then had ordered a bottle of Champagne, only to find out 10 min later that they were out of stock. So after not being greeted, then running out of stock and then finally choosing another bottle, it was 25 min before we were able to take our first sip. The rest of the evening went a bit better. This isn't a typical experience at the Grille and certainly shouldn't discourage anyone from going, but it's worth mentioning. We'll be back again.
January 25, 2016|A birthday fete|5|Service was impeccable as always. We were seated right away. I've never had bad food, ever. Yes, it's pricey...but you get what you pay for and you won't be disappointed. oh...the salted caramel ice cream- DREAMY!!!
January 23, 2016|Snowstorm birthday|5|I had made a reservation for my husbands bday before I knew we were getting snow. The restaurant was still open so we went an hour before our reservation and there was plenty of openings. This was our first time in the new location. Our server Nicole, was very nice and was very attentive to us. Our food was delicious. We both had the filet and the lobster Mac and cheese which is so decadent. The birthday dessert was delicious. My only detractor was that we were seated near the kitchen which was a little noisy. There were plenty of other tables so it was an interesting choice to place us. We will definitely be back.
January 23, 2016|The Capital Grille never disappoints.  T...|5|The Capital Grille never disappoints. The potato chips at the bar are fantastic and the the best stole doll around. Thats not to overlook the fantastic steak and always wonderful service at this location.
January 22, 2016|Great place|5|Excellent Resturant enjoyed the meal and the service was excellent.
January 22, 2016|Solid place with consistent quality--new location|4|The Grille has been a solid and consistent location for many years and that hasn't changed. The new location is terrific inside with nice outdoor views. The big negative however, is the lack of any parking and poorly executed valet parking. A restaurant of this stature needs a better solution. The balance, the food, service, ambiance, etc. are all solid. The old location had the superior parking solution.
January 22, 2016|Always a good meal!|5|Love the Capital Grille, was disappointed when they moved as I liked the old, original one but love the new one. The bar is bigger and open and love the decor. It is by far the best restaurant for Providence restaurant week you will find.

January 22, 2016|Always Outstanding|5|"Capital Grille - Providence, is the place to go for a special occasion. Have been there for wedding anniversaries, business dinners and special out-of-town guests. This most recent visit was to celebrate an upcoming retirement for the only Jesuit priest assigned to Rhode Island. The priest got caught up in his duties and we knew he'd run a little late but then he got lost. While lost, he called the restaurant for directions which were happily given. Despite our not being ready to eat for 40-45 minutes after our reservation time, our server, Megan, and staff were consistently cordial, friendly and understanding. The service, as always, was excellent and it happened to be the last night of ""Providence Restaurant Week"" and all the things I was going to order were there for a reduced price. Can't beat it!!!"

January 19, 2016|My fave for Providence Restaurant Week|5|Great value for Providence Restaurant week! Steaks were perfectly cooked. Made for a great dinner with friends! Gorgeous location and excellent service combined!
January 19, 2016|Nice view in expansive restaurant|5|I like the new location in old Ruth Chris Steakhouse building. Steaks are the reason to go. Delicious. Service is very attentive.
January 18, 2016|Dining as it Should Be|5|We went here for Restaurant Week. We've been to other restaurants that skimp and give a lesser dining experience for Restaurant Week. Not Capital Grille! Three steak options were available, as well as two delightful desserts to choose from. Our server, Matt, was helpful and fairly on-top of things - offering anchovies for the Caesar Salad and getting the name of that excellent Claret for us to take home. The food was exactly as you would expect it to be at Capital Grille - delicious and impeccably presented. Over all a very good dining experience.
January 17, 2016|We had another great meal at The Capital...|4|"We had another great meal at The Capital Grille. We've been to The Capital Grille Providence several times, but this was our first at the new location. The more modern decor adds some excitement or ""life"" into what used to feel more like ""your father's"" chop house. The steaks, sides, and cocktails were superb, as usual. Everything was perfectly prepared. My complaint, which I hate to make but cannot let pass, was the service from our primary waiter. Never at a restaurant of this caliber have I witnessed a waiter reaching over and across a patron, but ours did it routinely to place new silverware, pick-up dishes, even passing hot soup across my daughter to serve to my wife. There was plenty of room for him to work around the table, but maybe he was tired due to a long Providence Restaurant Week. Regardless of excuses, at a restaurant like The Capital Grille, I expect better. I expect near perfection."
January 17, 2016|restaurant week|5|was a fantastic deal; food was phenemenal. Waiter was knowledgeable - will definitely be back.
January 16, 2016|A little disceiving, not as advertized!|2|We made our reservation through Opentable from the advertised restaurant week website. Once we sat at our table the waiter informed us that they don't honor the restaurant week menu on Saturday's. We sometimes try new restaurants during these promotional weeks, it’s a great way to try a premium restaurant without over paying for a potential disappointing night. The food and atmosphere was good but I dislike misleading deceiving advertising.
January 15, 2016|Delicious!!!|5|The service was absolutely amazing! Very friendly and tentative. We had a 30 min wait on our reservation and received complimentry appetizer because of the wait, which was really nice because normally that doesn't happen at other restaurants. Food was amazing and cooked to perfection! Atmosphere was very mellow and welcoming.
January 15, 2016|Very disappointed|2|We made reservations through open table for 7:45pm.. We arrived at 7:30 and the desk person told us they were running late. So we headed to the bar.. It was very hard ordering drinks at the bar (very busy, bartenders were overworked.) The wines by the glass only offered 4 different Cabs (for a steak house I find this very strange.) At 8:15pm we approached the manager to find out how much longer our wait would be. She was very apologetic about the lateness and very nice. However we did not end up sitting down at our table until 8:30. They did give us calamari on the house (my sister is allergic to fish so she could not eat it.) the food was excellent, but inadequate service. My sister asked for a diet coke 3 times and my mom had to ask for her wine a couple of times before the waiter brought it... We were very disappointed... The creme brûlée was actually very runny too.... I think that they were overbooked because it was restaurant week... My sister and I used to go to the old capital grille in providence and the service there was always impeccable .
January 15, 2016|Great Time|5|great food as usual. Super attentive waiter. Decent value w/Providence Restaurant Week. Valet parking pickup is painful
January 15, 2016|Great meal in beautiful surroundings|5|This was our first visit to Capital Grille since they moved into their new location. There new site is beautiful! You feel like you're in NYC! The waitstaff is wonderful - helpful without being over-present. I had a nice clam chowder - smooth and flavorful and my friend had the Wedge Salad & enjoyed every bit. I had tenderloin which was cooked perfectly and was very tender and flavorful. My friend had surf & turf - a perfect filet with beautiful, huge shrimp. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake - best I've ever had and my friend had a wonderful crème brûlée. Interesting was that for the first time in almost 2 years, he was pleased with his very dry martini - perfection! We can't wait to go back. Hope you get Matthew as a waiter...he is charming and knowledgeable :)
January 15, 2016|Always consistent|5|Just dined at Capital Grille Providence during Restaurant week. Martinis at the bar with Bobby were perfect. Three course dinner with Mark as our waiter was cooked to our liking and consistent with other times we have dined there. Great steaks! SAMs mashed potatoes are very good. We love this restaurant for special occasions.

January 13, 2016|Always an excellent experience.|5|Always an excellent experience.
January 13, 2016|Restaurant Week|4|Wonderful petite filet mignon during reastaurant week. Mine was cooked perfectly however, my dinner guest's was over cooked. True to being an upscale restaurant our waiter made everything all right.
January 13, 2016|Great steak bad service|2|Steak was delicious. Sides were cold. Took 20 minutes for a drink refill. Waiter never checked in on how food was after it was delivered by staff. Waiter had arrogant rude demeanor. I have frequented this place for special occasions often throughout the years and this time it will be my last.
January 11, 2016|Happening Place|4|"We were here on a Monday night, and oh boy this place was hopping. Maybe because it was Restaurant week in Providence or its just busy all the time. Anyway, the food was great the service was very attentive, very friendly staff and will certainly return. I liked the mashed potatoes very much, they didn't have that ""restaurant taste"" more like home made and also the green beans were very good as well. The filet was cooked perfect and was fabulous!!!! Anna"

January 10, 2016|wonderful dining experience|4|Don't be upset having to wait for Valet. Once you get into the grille, the experience makes everything worthwhile. The food is consistently excellent and the wine menu is out of this world
January 10, 2016|providence week|5|providence week is something we always enjoy. It is wonderful food and we really like the value.
January 10, 2016|Capital Grill, Providence|4|I'm glad it was Restaurant Week. The meal would be vastly overpriced if I hd to pay the menu prices for it.
January 9, 2016|Excellent Evening|5|From start to finish, an amazing time. Hostess couldn't have been sweeter, bartender make an amazing French Martini and dinner was, absolutely fantastic. Ken, our server, was truly the best. A fantastic sense of humor and white glove service. If you visit, you must ask for him. Even thought though I often dine in Boston I would travel to RI for this experience.
January 9, 2016|Amazing|5|The food was out of this world. Service, from the greeting to the bartender to the server was fabulous. If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. My wife and myself will definitely be back.

We were impressed by every step of service, every course of food, and that management took the time to come around to say hello to guests.
January 2, 2016|The Capital Grille is always a good take...|4|The Capital Grille is always a good take and this time was no exception. It was our 1st visit to the Providence location since they moved into the old Ruth Chris space and the ambiance was spectacular. With outdoor seating available it should be even more spectacular in the warm weather. Our waiter Tom, who has served us before, is the finest server we've ever had. Everything was timed perfectly and we did not once find ourselves looking to find someone to provide any type of assistance.
January 1, 2016|We celebrated my mom's birthday on New Y...|5|We celebrated my mom's birthday on New Years day. Joel, our server was excellent. He paid attention to every detail. The food was fabulous and all the extras greatly appreciated.
December 31, 2015|First time at new location and...|4|Really like the new place. Makes me realize how cramped and dated the old place was. Definitely an upgrade - larger bar, larger dining room, more private dining options and while packed for NYE, it wasn't like you were sitting on top of other patrons. That being said, I do have some issues... The parking garage is a lot less convenient if you decide you don't want to valet. The prices at CG, across the county, have increased significantly over the years (seriously, my bone in filet mignon was $60 - while delicious, really???). On a busy holiday night you might get seated in a private dining room. While they're nice, it's obviously designed for a dinner program with a sales company and not fine dining (e.g., credenza, large screen tv on the wall, limited artwork). Same pricing, less scenic seats. Coat check appears to be gone. While they might take your coat, no one offered and I didn't see it. And, lastly but certainly not the least important, they're not participating in Restaurant Week 2016 on Saturday nights - so it's full price. Also, if you go for Restaurant Week lunch, you're paying for parking. Not much of a deal. Beyond that, though, a really good CG with really good food. Just be prepared to really pay for it...
December 28, 2015|"I liked the capital grille before.

About their new location: I have to say IMHO the old location at Union Station seemed to have more ambiance. In their defense it may be because our usual waiter (Matt Walters) was not on duty, plus it was a rainy day. Since we dine there multiple times a year, I shall review again.
December 24, 2015|Wonderful !!!|5|Our dining experience is always extraordinary at this restaurant. The menu provides many excellent choices. Service is beyond expectation.
December 24, 2015|I spent $1,000 on a dinner for 9 members...|3|I spent $1,000 on a dinner for 9 members of my family on Christmas Eve. Overall experience was ok. The food was good. Service was ok. We were greeted right away and seated at a great table. The biggest complaint and a significant one in my mind was my daughter's filet which came out very late (5-7 minutes after everyone else was served) and very undercooked. She could not eat it. She ordered it medium and it came out very rare. They brought her another one cooked to the right temperature and took it off the bill. Still, when you spend $1,000 they should get it right. Our server seemed to have too many tables. His service was very slow, bordering on inattentive. He was a nice enough guy and I tipped him well, but I was disappointed. It is a shame.
December 18, 2015|My reservation was a birthday surprise d...|4|My reservation was a birthday surprise dinner for my boyfriend. There was a slight delay in being sat but once we were the service was excellent. Jesse was our server, he was very informative about the food and had a great attitude. The restaurant offered us a complimentary champagne toast, which was very sweet of them.
December 18, 2015|Wonderful Evening.|5|Service is impeccable (thanks Tim!)...Food excellent! It's a pricey night but for a special occasion it truly is a wonderful experience & great location.
December 18, 2015|Excellent service, great food, very expensive.|4|"If you dine here (which you should), ask to be seated at one of Joe's tables. My wife and I had dinner there recently, the steaks were superb, and Joe's service was even better. This would be a ""can't miss"" place except that you're going to drop in the neighborhood of a hundred bucks for two entrees, and then on top of that it's easy to get north of two hundred (and I'm not talking about with a bottle of wine - that's one cocktail, two glasses of wine, and no dessert). That said, the steaks are top shelf, the rest of dinner was very good, the place is vibrant and fun, and the service is great. There is not much not to like about Providence's Capital Grille."
December 17, 2015|What a fantastic experience!|5|Matt Walters was a great server, I had an excellent time with my girlfriend for her birthday, they surprised us with a awesome happy birthday dessert that was complementary. The food was amazing and the valet parking was free! I will recommend the capital Grille in Providence to everybody that I know thank you for an unforgettable night to all The staff at the capital Grille in Providence

December 15, 2015|Delicious lunch|5|Had lunch with our top client and it was a perfect spot. Great service!
Dined on December 14, 2015|Lunch in rhode island|5|Love going to capital grill lunch is do delicious and I especially like the jumbo shrimp added to the lunch menu in fact I liked it so much I ordered it in providence and chestnut hill
December 12, 2015|Serious Beef!|5|The lobster bisque was loaded with chunks of lobster and the waiter was righter there with a drizzle of sherry! Dry aged bone in strip with shallot butter and a side of creamed spinach enough for 4 people! We had to walk home to work it off!
December 12, 2015|Celebrate Capital Grille style|4|A great place for dinner for two or a big family celebration. The service is 5 stars, helpful knowledgeable staff. The food is top notch. This restaurant has an amazing location right on the water. We can't wait to return this summer to eat on the patio. Call early to get a reservation on the weekend or use open table.com.
December 12, 2015|Always a pleasure and enjoyable dining.....|5|Always a pleasure and enjoyable dining...The Capital Grille is my favorite restaurant-especially the Providence location!
December 9, 2015|Never disappoints|5|As always the Cap Grille does't disappoint. Rib Eye was cooked to perfection and the wine list was filled with great selections. The waiter was a true professional..
December 5, 2015|When we arrived with a reservation we we...|4|"When we arrived with a reservation we were told they were running 15 mins behind. So we grabbed a drink at the bar. 25mins passed and I asked how they were moving along as I was seeing people getting seated and not us. They automatically seated us I think they forgot. It was all good from there. We sat and had great server food was good and came in a timely manner. Towards the end we were running late as we had show to go to and advised him we need to wrap up soon and they literally got us in and out at that moment. I was very pleased and will be back again. I had the special African lobster tail my fiance had a bone in steak from the "" Chef Suggestions"" he loved it. Lobster mac and cheese was one of the best I've had."
December 4, 2015|Consistently Excellent|5|Special occasion dining here is always a sure bet. Have dined at Capital Grille since its founding, I have never once been disappointed. And of note, on this occasion even though known for its steaks, the tuna I had was unsurpassed with any that I have had anywhere.
November 26, 2015|Still has some of the food around.|4|The valet parking is nice but I still like the old place. This place just doesn't have the same feel. Food is still great. Same staff.
November 26, 2015|Great New Location|5|Wonderful Thanksgiving Day lunch! So thankful that these true professionals give up some of their time on the holiday to help make our holiday special. Food and service are ALWAYS top shelf at the Capital Grille.
November 26, 2015|2015 Thanksgiving at Capital Grille was amazing.|5|Our family could not be together this year so husband I decided to go out. Capital Grille was top notch.
November 23, 2015|Grandson enjoyed having dinner with me. ...|5|Grandson enjoyed having dinner with me. Steak delicious as were scallops and risotto
November 21, 2015|Outstanding!|5|Tom was our waiter and I would definitely request his table the next time we come in. Food was awesome! We ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cocktail and the Lobster/Crab cakes. The Crab Cocktail was so fresh! Three of us had the Filet Mignon, and my husband had another kind of steak. We ordered 3 sides to share; Lobster Mac & Cheese, Asparagus, and Mashed Potatoes; it was plenty for all of us. Dessert was delicious! There's nothing bad to say from the minute we walked in to the minute we left the restaurant. We have already made reservations for our anniversary. I love the little touches you add to the table. We were there celebrating our daughter's 17th birthday and on the table was small balloon confetti. I wasn't sure what it was at first, but then I realized what they were. The table next to us had rose petals; small things like that, make a restaurant memorable.
November 20, 2015|BEST PLACE, but super pricey|5|title says it all. Literally was the best steak of my life, but it was also the most expensive steak of my life.
November 15, 2015|Disappointed!|3|There were four of us, and two of us were disappointed. The other two were indifferent. We were offered an inside table, while there were several empty tables along the windows. When asked for it, the hostess told us to wait there so she can check. This happen to another group of dinners as well. We ordered shrimp cocktails, it was dry and tasteless. Ceasar salad was bland. Chilean sea bass was salty and over cooked, instead of a soy broth (similar to the Chestnut Hill location), it was a thick soy sauce . The steaks were fine, not exceptional just fine. Good asparagus. The dessert was very nice. Last note, our dinners were packed to take home, and they all were sealed so we had to open them individually to see which one which. Hopefully, everything will be improved down the road, but right now, we would hesitate to recommend or return. We hope this was helpful and constructive to your business.
November 14, 2015|New place|5|This was the first time to the new place in Provodence. Beautiful!! So comfortable and tons of room. The bar wasn't crowded. Just enough to be able to sit and enjoy your drink. Dinner was wonderful as always. The valet service was wonderful. My husband and love the place and plan on going back many more times.

November 7, 2015|One of the best things I did in Providence|4|I went there for the Rhode Island Comic Con and only had one night to really go out and eat. After reading some reviews, we decided on Capital Grille. I will say it was a great experience and the food was great too. Only thing bad I have to say is I made a reservation for 8:30pm and didnt get seated til almost 8:45. A very minor and small detail and that didn't make us dislike the place. Can't wait to come back and get another steak.
November 6, 2015|Should have stayed at original spot|3|The new location can not compare to the original restaurant. The original restaurant was by far the classiest spot in Rhode Island by far. Very disappointed in new place and would not return

November 3, 2015|Great New Location|5|Fantastic service and Food. Really cater to the guest. The new location is beautiful. Worth checking out if you haven't already.
November 1, 2015|excellent experience|5|We had a very romantic anniversary dinner at the Capital Grille in Providence. Joel was attentive and knowledgeable as well as gave great recommendations. At dessert we were presented with complimentary champagne and a beautiful anniversary dessert. I would definitely recommend it!
October 30, 2015|Always a wonderful dining experience.|5|As always the food was wonderful from stat to finish. It was my birthday and they placed rose petals and confetti on the table which was a nice touch. They also gave a wonderful free dessert on a plate that was stenciled with a chocolate happy birthday wish on it. We have dined here many times over the years and they never disappoint. Our only issue on this visit was we were sat near the kitchen entrance it was not very romantic and a bit busy with all the wait staff going in and out and a bit noisy.
October 30, 2015|It was our 18th wedding anniversary and ...|4|It was our 18th wedding anniversary and the hostesses as well as staff we came in contact with wished us well on our day . Even the valet. Attention to detail did nit go unnoticed an d my wife really felt appreciated. Great night out.

October 25, 2015|Vin|5|Main courses were very good but side dishes just OK...asparagus tough, fingerling potatoes dry. Service was exceptional and our request for a quiet booth was accomodated.
October 25, 2015|An anniversary made special . . . again!|5|"Went again (have been there perhaps 15-20 times over the years) for our 41st anniversary. First, the bad news. They moved from the place they've been for years to the former Ruths Chris location in the GTECH building. Because I made my reservation on Open Table, I never noticed the change in location. The afternoon of our dinner, I got a re-confirmation call and they never mentioned the location change (about 3 months ago). Went to the old location and I and another ""fooled"" patron discovered the vacant spot. Noticed on my reservation of the different address. It went swimmingly after we finally went around the corner to the new place. Matt W is an outstanding waiter. Always there whenever we needed him and never hovering. A nice touch was the quiet, romantic table; congratulatory note; complimentary 2 glasses of champagne; complimentary dessert sampler and 2 champagne flute glasses (with the ""Capital Grille"" logo, of course). My filet mignon could have been cut with a fork. The wedge salad was humongous and delicious. My wife had the swordfish special and we might well make this an annual event. Kudos to Capital Grille and staff and especially Matt W."
October 25, 2015|Hello from mass|4|Very good food. Drink was weak. No effort to fix or change.
October 17, 2015|Brown University Family Weekend|5|From the moment we arrived , everything was perfect ! We were seated immediately . The table was set perfectly , tables were set far enough apart so that we didn't feel crowded . We all felt so special ! We were waited on right away . Our waiter was great , always on time , answered all of our questions . The food was delectable . Our steaks were cooked exactly the way we wanted . They tasted better than we anticipated . My first time at this location was last year and I will definitely return . Thank you for this perfect evening celebrating Brown 's Family Weekend !
October 16, 2015|A great place to celebrate!|5|My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last weekend and the staff went above and beyond to make it momentous. Rose petals on the table, champagne toast and mini desserts (complete with candles to blow out!) - it was a perfect night. Food and service were superb, to boot!
October 16, 2015|Providence Capital Grille is superb!|5|The Providence location more than equals the quality of all the other Capital Grilles across the country. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the menu adequate for all tastes, and the food simply delicious. Expensive, but a great place for special occasions.
October 16, 2015|Great celebration|5|We went to the Capital Grille in their new space for the first time Friday night. We were celebrating the end of the 2014 individual tax filing season and it was the perfect choice! Our filets were each cooked perfectly and as usual the Caprese salad was to die for! The service was perfect. Thanks!

October 12, 2015|Overpriced steak|2|Overall my dining experience at Capital Grille was okay. However, I spent almost $50 on a filet, which came with no sides. I ordered my filet rare, and it was cooked medium. The flavor wasn't great either. The lobster Mac and cheese was delicious though.

October 8, 2015|Great as always|5|I have been to a few Capital Grille around the USA and they never disappoint. Steaks are always amazing. Service is always impeccable. This location in Providence is also situated in a very beautiful spot in the city. Well worth it - but be ready to pay a bit higher price.

Dined on September 26, 2015|Disappointed|2|We have enjoyed dining at the Capital Grille in Providence for a number of years. We typically celebrate our anniversary by visiting the city during a Waterfire and dining at the Capital Grille. We were quite surprised and disappointed the other night to learn that they had moved from their location to the old Ruths Chris site. What a difference! If you enjoy Capital Grille as we do, this is not the place for you. The ambiance was gone, the décor was way out of character from all the Capital Grilles we've visited, sadly reminiscent of a Bugaboo Creek! It was also very loud...not at all what we had hoped. Service was OK...the hosting station seemed disinterested. The meal was very good, though. We enjoy Waterfire. We'll just have to find another restaurant in Providence when we visit.
September 26, 2015|Not the best night to try the new locati...|4|Not the best night to try the new location as restaurant jam-packed due to Waterfire event outdoors as well as a fundraiser on the patio. Steaks cooked to perfection as always, and treated to a nice dessert in honor of my birthday. Will definitely be back on a quieter night.

September 22, 2015|Location of reservation|5|The seat reserved for us was horrible. First time reserved through Open Table and worst seating I have ever had. Seats at the bar, which I requested, but in traffic lane of servers! I felt like I was eating in the middle of a highway.
September 20, 2015|Wonderful evening|5|The evening was as expected. Great food, exceptional service, and wonderful new venue. Our server,Frank, timed everything perfectly. The local oyster appetizer and crab and lobster cakes were a great beginning. Followed by tuna and an aged porterhouse steak , both cooked to perfection.
September 19, 2015|Amazing! Steak and Stoli are the best!|5|Amazing! Steak and Stoli are the best!

Seeing our party included an older woman who was clearly handicapped, we were seated as far away from the door as we could get. If several people asked if she needed to use the elevator, you might think they would seat us at a table that would be easy for her to get to. We waited much longer for everything than we ever did at the other location. Our server was good, however it was 20 mins before we had a drink. One would also think that when ordering Lobster crab cakes for $18 dollars that are the size of 2 half dollars they would come out cold. We had our appetizers and before we were done, we were being served our meals. It was a scramble to get all of the appetizer plates off of the table. We ordered 3 sides...lobster mac and cheese, truffle fries and mushrooms that the waiter graciously asked if we would like to add onions to. Our meals were served w/ the fries, a creamy spinach and onions. The waiter had to run back to get the mac and cheese and get the side of mushrooms to add to our onions. Like I said, all of our steaks were amazing and cooked perfectly, however everything else fell far short of expectations! It could have been an off night for them as we have had several very good experiences here.
September 19, 2015|Very nice, Valet needs work.|5|It was a beautiful evening to sit outside! Very nice! Food was very good! Manager was very nice! Waitress was very nice. However, my measure of a good waitress is -did I get lemon with my water. I had to ask three times. That always annoys me, but that is my only complaint. We used valet and it definitely needs some work. People weren't sure where to go, traffic was backed up at the curb. That being said, the manager was right outside consulting.
September 18, 2015|Awsome!|5|As usual, not disappointed at all. Lobster bisque and lobster salad roll plate for lunch was out of this world...oh, and the mint lemonade too!
September 12, 2015|Food , as always was great!|4|Food is always great at the Capital Grille. However, I made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time for my boyfriend's 60 th birthday and asked for window seating because it was a Waterfire night. The hostess sat us at a table right next to the kitchen! We both very disappointed and asked to be moved. She did move us but, we still did not have a view of the river.😢😢

The outdoor dining is wonderful, it was a great way to spend an evening and the waiter and staff were wonderful to us. The kids had a great time as well and they offered kids meals at a great price!"

September 1, 2015|AWESOME|5|Our server Zo was very attentive to our needs. Enjoyed lunch celebrating our 29th anniversary. We will definitely be back, to enjoy a wonderful dinner on the patio. Thanks to Zo.
August 31, 2015|Special occasion - Birthday|5|Great food and service. Fantastic dining experience. The perfect way to celebrate a special occasion. Would highly recommend it. Bring your Visa card, its pricey.
August 30, 2015|Sooooo good|5|This Capitol Grill was a fantastic dining experience. Very professional service from our table attendant. She was always available and attentive but was not intrusive. The atmosphere was wonderful. The tables are far enough apart that we didn't hear other people's conversations. Our dinners were absolutely fabulous. The whole experience was was a pleasure.
August 29, 2015|First and last visit to new location.|2|I'll take my business to another location in the future. Horrible experience with the hostess and her listening skills.
August 28, 2015|A+ Service!!!|5|A+ Service!!!
August 27, 2015|Service was a disaster!|3|"Look-it's the Capital Grille...you know if will be excellent food, excellent service, and a big bill...well the food was mostly excellent...the salmon, and two steaks were very good, but the scallops lacked a good sear and for $42 how can they not have a sear?...but the real issue was the service...over 35 minutes at the table with only water and bread...the server only stopped by to say he would be ""right back"" and then it was worse from there...the generous pour was out of three of the eight wines and the servers plan was to give us free dessert and seemed shocked when I said he wanted him to sub in three other wines...and then the service got slower and slower and out meal (just apps and dinner) took almost 3 1/5 hours...not a great night for a such a great establishment."
August 26, 2015|The food was great but the service was s...|3|The food was great but the service was slow. We moved from inside to outside, very accommodating as I was entertaining guests from a different country. We were however approached by an inside waiter who rudely announced to our table that he would have been our waiter but since we were moving outside he wasn't anymore. Awkward moment for the entire table. We moved outside great view, our guests appreciated the change, we ordered. Shortly after our first bottle of wine we noticed food was coming out for several tables that sat and ordered after us. Our reservations were at 630, salads and appetizers arrived at 820. The moment some of us finished, they quickly removed the plates, some with partial portions still on the plates, because entrees where coming out. Entree arrived at 849. It was a little embarrassing as a host, to out of town guests, to see this after speaking highly of The Capital Grill. The waiter who I pulled aside and asked him what happened, couldn't give a reason or really seemed to care. Didn't approach the table and apologize for the kitchen, after knowing we were upset about the delay. Management at The Capital Grill needs to work on that. Food however was Great, Lobster Mac n Cheese, Steak, truffle fries, all amazing. Service and kitchen timing was off. May have been an off night for the staff, but would have appreciated the waiter coming over and acknowledging the issue.
August 26, 2015|My birthday lunch|5|As usual it was delicious the dessert was unbelievable snd happy birthday was written in chocolate it was a nice touch. Also manager sent over two lobster appetizer on a homemade chip for my birthday such a nice touch everyone should come here at least once if not more one of my favorite restsurants
August 25, 2015|New location same great food|5|I took a group from the office to treat them to generous pours night . They recently moved to the old Ruth's Chris location. Miss the old spot but the new sert up is very nice. One caveat is the music was very loud and they seemed unable to fix it. We sat at the back,of the restaurant which was better. Once settling in, we were brought an array of great wines. The Bibb salad was crisp and perfectly seasoned. We ordered a variety of dishes like sea bass, and porterhouse steak. All cooked to perfection
August 23, 2015|Always a sure bet|4|Have gone to this restaurant for special occasions over the years and it always delivers with excellent food and service. Allow yourself to ignore the prices and enjoy a special night out!
August 16, 2015|Incredible Service|5|Thank you so much to the entire staff at the Capitol Grille- Providence. I have always been a fan of the Capital Grille, but the attention to detail and superb service, just astounded me this time. I decided to go out to celebrate my husband's birthday with his parents this year, and from beginning to end, it was a success. Everyone, starting with the valets, host staff,service staff, and managers (and let's not forget the superb job of the chefs in the kitchen!) went above and beyond to make this a special event. Jaclyn, our server, was phenomenal! Very impressed with everything. I know it is not easy to please everyone, but even looking around the dining room, we observed that every table was being catered to...well done!
August 15, 2015|Awesome, from the apps, drinks, dinner, ...|5|Awesome, from the apps, drinks, dinner, to a dessert offering, everything was perfect!!
August 15, 2015|"Not what we expected from ""The Capital Grille"""|2|We might as well have been at TGI Fridays. The waiters were so busy that they could barely keep up. Food was okay but came out way too fast. Ordered drinks before dinner that showed up half way through the meal. For the price they charge, the new place is nothing special. We will never go back.
August 14, 2015|Beautiful New Location|5|Went to the new location Friday night. Sat outside on the patio for drinks before heading into the dining room. The restaurant is breathtaking. Because it had just moved I assumed there might be some kinks to work out but it felt like everyone had been working there for years. The service and food were top notch as always. Julianna who took care of us outside and Matt who did the same inside were perfect in every way. We couldn't have asked for more. This is an A+ restaurant with A+ staff. Well done Capital Grille Providence
August 1, 2015|A no complaint evening|5|This Capital Grille is much larger than others. There were 5 hostesses upon arrival ! I was very pleased that we were led to a smaller room than the main room--and it was still very energetic (read loud but not distracting). The server, Joel, was a master at his work. He knew enough about the food, the wine, the history of the Grille and he struck the right balance of friendliness and talkativeness. We would definitely go there again when in Providence. We would go more often if everything were not a la carte. The high prices make this a special event/occasion restaurant rather than a return-to-often venue.
July 31, 2015|Love it at Capital Grill|5|My husband & I went for our anniversary & arrived to a table beautifly decorated with rose petals & heart confetti. The waiter was attentive with out being too much & helped with the perfect wine selection. The food was wonderful- we had the seafood tower, bone-in filet mignon & the double lamb ribs. For sides, we had the sautéed mushrooms & Brussels sprouts (which were a little to undercooked for me, thus the 4 stars & not 5). For dessert, they sent over 2 glasses of champagne & 2 desserts. Everything was delicious!!
July 31, 2015|A Bittersweet Experience|5|Capital Grille in Providence, RI has been a unique establishment. For the past several years during which we have frequented it, my husband and have so enjoyed the experience due to the beautiful surroundings, the wonderful staff , and the music of Tony Cerbo. All of that is now in the past as they move to a new venue. We truly will miss the elegant evenings at the lounge of the Union Station Capital Grille. Thank you to the staff and to the phenomenal Tony Cerbo for creating so many memories and special times in our lives. As diners, we favor restaurants which offer quality live entertainment, so consequently, we will most likely not be returning due to the absence of Tony.

He conducted a whole wine tasting explaining every note accurately and was able to comment on menu items with ease. He made everything sound just as mouthwatering as it was! He performed the job of the somm and the waiter, and did so excellently. The kona rubbed steak was also to die for. Unbelievable experience!

July 25, 2015|Capital Grille - Flagship|4|We had not ever been to the Capital Grille Providence location and used Providence's Restaurant Week as our push to go. (We usually go the Capital Grille in Chestnut Hill, Mass.) We experienced very good food and service with just one nit to pick - our server brought my wife's coffee after she ate her dessert instead of before serving her dessert. He did deduct the cost of the coffee from the tab. Other than that one nit, the quality of the food and service were very good. We also thought the bread basket had higher quality that the one that Chestnut Hill Grille serves. We decided to add to our Restaurant Week Menu choices by using the regular menu to get the Rhode Island Calamari (well, we were in Rhode Island) and it was superb: lightly battered and a great taste.
July 24, 2015|Amazing steak and great wines|5|The waiter was very attentive and helped us pick a fantastic wine. Huge and high quality bread basket, the steaks were cooked to perfection, and the creme Brulee was delicious
Dined on July 24, 2015|Great birthday celebration|5|I visited The Capital Grille with my goddaughter for lunch during restaurant week to celebrate her birthday. We told our waiter that we only had an hour for lunch. Even though the restaurant was crowded he made it happen without making us feel rushed. The food was excellent and prepared exactly how we asked. Truly a very nice experience.
July 24, 2015|Great lunch spot|5|We went for lunch during Providence Restaurant Week and everything was great. Sometimes places skimp on something during Restaurant Week, but not here. Service was excellent, food was great and I was glad we had a reservation, because by 12:15 the place was packed.
July 23, 2015|Love it here $|5|One of my favorite restaurants ever! We go every time there is a restaurant week as there is no better deal out there. Will be sad when they move but sure it will be better than ever.
July 23, 2015|Good but just not quite there.|3|We sat outside as it was very comfortable and relaxing. The area was fairly quiet. The staff was nice and came through fairly often. My steak was well done and I ordered medium rare. The waiter was attentive, took care of the problem, and the manager came out to make sure it was right. Second time around much better.
July 23, 2015|Capital Grille|5|Dining at the Capital Grille is a special treat and whenever I go there, that's exactly what it feels like! The wait staff is terrific (always) and the food is delicious. I had a wedge salad that I could have easily turned into a meal. I wish I had everlasting funds to go there on a more regular basis!
July 23, 2015|Providence Restaurant Week|4|Restaurant Week provides an excellent opportunity to try a rather expensive restaurant for a very reasonable price. It turned me into a regular customer!
July 22, 2015|Restaurant Weeks Menu|4|We visited for Restaurant Weeks, and their special menu selection was almost perfect. We loved that there was an option to upgrade to surf and turf for only $10 more, but we did notice that there were no entree options for vegetarians (they probably don't frequent steak houses often). We had a great meal and a great time.
July 22, 2015|Loved the whole experience!|5|I come to Capitol Grille on Providence Restaurant week. My mother and daughter and I love the whole experience! The food is fabulous but the wait staff never fails to impress! Thank you to Ronnie who made it fun! Thanks also to the Beverage Manager who was quick to help and very nice! 5 thumbs up to a great place!
July 20, 2015|Very nice and enjoyable experience ...|5|Service level experienced was excellent ... exceeded my expectations from everyone ...
July 20, 2015|service was very slow…… ..|2|We had dinner reservations for 6pm for 2 and was seated at 550 and very small crowd dinning. Waiter came over asked what we wanted to drink told him and he came back with 1 wrong drink but I kept it. He left and never came back for. Approx 25min. When he did he asked if we was ready to order I said did u forget about us and we told him we did not have a menu… while we were waiting others in our seating area were being serviced by our waiter. We planned on just getting up to leave and called another restaurant to see if we could get a table but they had none available till 830. We stayed and placed order and food was good bit the experience ruined the dinner for us. Tab was 150.00 and we have dined withe capital 3x before. I guess during restaurant week the staff service degrades to the of a chain style restaurant.. We will stick with Mills Tavern food and service top quality.
July 19, 2015|Pretty darned good|4|Attentive and friendly service; delicious food; rich surroundings. The establishment could not control for the screaming baby in the neighboring table, but that wasn't even terrible. I have to say that the bench I sat on was bouncy enough that I was tossed around by the person sitting behind me. Otherwise, a very nice meal out.
July 18, 2015|Impressed our out of town guests!|4|Our personal dining experiences here have always been terrific, but this visit Sat nite was with 3 out of town family member who have never dined at capitol Grille..we were not disappointed..It was delightful to see patrons smartly dressed as u would expect at a fine retaurant on a Sat. nite..very rare in RI..Great service ; Ken is a gem..wine drinkers were delighted by their choices and cocktails are always spot on..One dissapointment ..no more clean stemmed martinin glasses for our martinis..believe me a cosmo or xtra dry martini belongs in a martini glass! Steaks were geat, but the Cesaer salads were under par..and the amounts of the sides were for a table of 2 ..not 5! too bad cause they r beyond tasty.. My guests were thrilled by there experience..they will visit in there home towns..Boston and Orlando..
July 18, 2015|Excellent food and service.|5|The service and food were very enjoyable. Staff was especially friendly. Looking forward to another visit at the new location.

The waiter seemed in a hurry to get us out at the end which I understand during restraint week it gets a little crazy but I frequent this restaurant all the time so that attitude from the server was a little much
July 17, 2015|Our server Meghan was delightful.|5|The food was spectacular as always. Our lunch during the Providence Resataurant Week was way above our expectations.
July 16, 2015|Just an awsome experience in every way.|5|The food was superb and has to be at the top of the list. Just as wonderful was the personal service that we received. All the little things that are always missing these day were not missing here. Our waiter knew our name when he greeted us. He was always there when we needed him, but never hanging around trying to rush us. The young woman that brought us to our table always had a smile and genuinely enjoyed her job, so much so that we had to mention her to management. The manager visited all the tables and got an earful of praise from us. It was as close to a perfect dining experience as anyone could ask for.

Decorated our table with balloon confetti and brought her a special dessert at the end of the meal with a candle. Have been here many times and will continue to return.
July 15, 2015|Special Occasion|4|The food is great as well as the service. It was a bit too loud for my taste. I had to shout when talking to my husband. The menu is a bit pricey but great for a special occasion.

July 12, 2015|Not our first visit|4|We arrived on time for our reservation and were brought to our table right away. Had wanted to dine outside but it was really hot so we chose to dine inside. It was rather noisy for not being at capacity. Everything was good. Its not a place to stop by for a casual dinner at is is pricy. We were two for dinner with it being restaurant week and our bill with tip was still $147.00 That said it is a normal 100.00 per person restaurant. We enjoyed everything but the cappuchino which was 99% froth heavy like whipped cream and no coffee. I ate it with a spoon and should have requested a new one. THANKS
June 28, 2015|SPECTACULAR !!!|5|Couldn't have thought of a better place to celebrate our Anniversary! Table was donned with baby heart cut-outs and a card with a hand-written Anniversary message from the staff! A champagne flute garnished with a raspberry was presented to us to enjoy a private toast. Followed with along with a dessert sampler plate with a piece of flourless chocolate cake , a tiny round cheesecake with a burnt sugar topping, a spoonfull of fresh raspberries and to top it off, the words Happy Anniversary written in chocolate sauce in center of plate!! Calamari, steaks and lobster mac-n-cheese were phenomenal!! Service was impeccable too !! Simple can't criticize perfection !! A must place to experience!!
June 28, 2015|not as good as it used to be|4|service was great, but food was ok this visit. and very $$$$$!!!
June 20, 2015|Thanks!|5|Thanks for a great evening preceding our wedding engagement later that night!
June 20, 2015|Simply outstanding food from start to fi...|5|Simply outstanding food from start to finish with service from our waitperson second to none. Once again, this is THE go to restaurant for the ultimate special dining experience. I'll not be able to eat beef anywhere else that comes this close to perfection. We had not been to The Capital Grille in some time. Clearly our loss . We won't wait that long before our next visit.
June 20, 2015|Great Place|5|My wife and I love the Capital Grille for there atmosphere and of course the food. Great customer service !!!

June 7, 2015|We celebrated our 40th anniversary there...|5|We celebrated our 40th anniversary there on Sunday night. We knew the food would be excellent and we were not dissapointed. The service was great. We will use the Capital Grill for just these types of occasions.
June 7, 2015|Our Anniversary Dinner|5|We failed to add the Anniversary note to our Open Table reso !! Our waiter, Chris Reynolds, picked up on it and next thing you know we had the royal treatment.....Champ toast, Rose Pedals, & desert on a Anniv Plate !! Even the GM , M Phillips, came by to wish us his best !! Everything was great and we will return soon !! We have enjoyed several Cap Grill Rest in different parts of the USA....All are very nice !! Great steaks !!
June 6, 2015|The personalized service we received was...|5|The personalized service we received was incredible. Celebrated my wife's birthday and I've never had a place do as amazing a job as The Capital Grille. The food was amazing - nothing could have been better. By far, the best that Providence has to offer.
May 30, 2015|Venerable is a Good Thing|5|Always a treat to dine where great food and attentive service is consistent in a beautiful atmosphere.
May 18, 2015|Food not cooked to liking|3|Over cooked lamb chop special. Over cooked salmon special. Very dry
May 16, 2015|graduation dinner|4|food was excellent, and service was first class. only problem was AC unit leaked on part of our table
May 16, 2015|Graduation Dinner made special|5|We found this wonderful place to have our special dinner with our daughter who recent,y graduated from Bryant U with honors. They provided us with fantastic service, an entertaining attentive wait person, and a very nice table found at the last minute through this wonderful site. The Capital Grille gave Ashley a nice desert dish which was beautifully prepared and tasted as it appeared. The beautiful boxed pen being engraved with her year of graduation was an expected delightful surprise for her. I highly recommend this site and the Capital Grille, the attention to detail was superb, right down to the validated free parking outside the restaurant.
May 10, 2015|Capital Grille Providence|4|We went Mother's Day. The food was very good. I had Filet Mignon.It was excellent. I had mashed potatoes, that were one of the best I have ever ate. A friend had the baked stuffed shrimp and said it was very good. My husband had the baked macaroni with lob ester. And he enjoyed it. My daughter did not like anything on the menu. I asked if they had a children's menu and they made chicken fingers and fries for her. So everyone was happy. I would definitely go back. No a place for me to go every week because they are pricey. Very nice for a special occasions. Our waiter was not the best. He kept forgetting things and ways always apologizing. He tried to be happy and pleasant, but you could tell he was not sincere.
May 9, 2015|Excellent dining experience|5|Everything, the food, service & ambiance were great as always!!! Eric, our waiter, provided excellent, friendly professional service. This was my wife's birthday celebration and the Capital Grille made it extra special. The Providence Capital Grille is the original and remains the best!!!
April 18, 2015|"Amazing! 
This was on my bucket list. Ro..."|5|Amazing! This was on my bucket list. Rose petals on the table and the spinach salad. Lobster bisque. Filet mignon and lobster were amazing. As was the service and dessert!!!
Dined on April 18, 2015|Another wonderful dinner|5|Once again my future wife and I dined at the Capitol Grille in providence. This is absolutely my favorite restaurant of all. I have never been dissatisfied about any part of the dining experience from this restaurant. From when you walk in the door till you leave. The service is fabulous, the food is perfection and the atmosphere is wonderful. The food and the service is second to none. Our server Eric is the best, so make sure you ask for him. He will help to create a wonderful dining experience for you. I highly recommend the Kona crusted sirloin or the Porterhouse, melt in your mouth delicious!
April 18, 2015|You must have the Dry Aged Sirloin Au Poivre.|5|You will be mad at yourself if you die before eating this steak. As always, the customer service is beyond excellent. And a helpful hint: the sides can be ordered in half portions. So, if you're like us, you can order them ALL. Because again, you will be mad if you die and you didn't order all the sides.
April 11, 2015|THe Capital Grille is wonderful|5|My wife and 17 year old son dined at The Grille last Sat night.We all had a great time and the food was fantastic. They have lots of other choices but this is primarily a red meat lovers paradise. I would highly recommend this place but it is quite expensive. Our total cost was $300 with tip.
April 11, 2015|Yummy|5|We have never had a bad meal here. Service is always top notch. Pricey but worth every penny.
April 11, 2015|The Capital Grille never fails to be outstanding.|5|"Food the service are always outstanding. It was my wife's and my 6th year anniversary. Our waiter, Tom, asked us if there was a special occasion, I did not initially volunteer the information. Our food was incredible, my steak was probably the best I have ever had. After dinner, Tom brought us a complimentary dessert with the words, ""Happy Anniversary"" spelled out in chocolate on the plate. Tom also took some photos for us so we will have nice memories for future reference. Great time!"
April 6, 2015|Nice Evening|4|There were four of us and all the starters and main courses were excellent, as usual. The only exception was the dessert which was not what we thought we ordered, but it was no big deal and nothing was said to the wait staff. Wine list is extensive and reasonably priced by restaurant standards. Service was attentive and professional. Have returned here a number times when in Providence. Will return again without hesitation when next in Providence.
April 4, 2015|A Miss for The Capital Grille|3|Great service, wine, and atmosphere but The Capital Grille in Providence was off of their game on the night that we visited. Two of us had soups and we had to send them both back because they were too cold. Then, when my steak arrived it was overcooked. The waiter offered to have the kitchen cook me a new one but then I had to wait for it to arrive while my friends were having their dinners. I've dined at other locations of the The Capital Grille and have never experienced these sorts of issues. I hope that this experience was just an anomaly for the Providence location.
March 22, 2015|Delicious and Accommodating!|5|To be honest, I was a bit unsure when my son wanted to go to Capital Grille for his 25th birthday. I know the steaks are amazing and I had been there before, however I have stop eating meat and fish and thought I would get a salad and a vegetable side, after all , it was his birthday! Our server Chris was knowledgeable and friendly, but not overbearing, just the way you'd want a special occasion to be. I mentioned to Chris that I didn't eat meat or fish and he told the chef would prepare me a farm plate from vegetables in the kitchen. I have to say it was the best plate of grilled vegetables I've had anywhere and we eat out often and at a variety of places. My son and husband had steaks which they said were delicious, my daughter had a swordfish special which she loved and I was thrilled with my farm plate. To end the meal, the chef sent out a birthday dessert for my son. Also impressive to us was the noise level, lately no matter where you go it's so loud you can barely have a conversation. The restaurant was full, I believe every table was sat, however the noise level was wonderful...not sure if it's acoustics or the fact that we weren't crammed up next to each other....all in all a wonderful meal and a memorable occasion!
March 21, 2015|great service,,,,,,,,,but|4|Waiter was very good. Great with suggestions and did not rush us at all on a busy night. Steak was ordered medium cam well done, baked potato was cold. Waiter did ask was everything alright but I didn't want to wait around for a new steak

March 6, 2015|Wonderful dining experience|5|We went to capital grille for a birthday dinner. We had wonderful attentive service with great food with every course. Beautiful restaurant and great staff. Our server Kristen had a smile for us all night!!!
February 15, 2015|Turn heat up on cold nights!|5|Ask for Nicole as your waitress. She is outstanding! Warm, friendly and knowledgeable!
February 14, 2015|Awesome|5|Capital grill offers great food, atmosphere, and service. Ken as always was an amazing server.
February 14, 2015|High priced|4|It was my boyfriends first time there. We arrived & ordered a drink at the bar - one Cosmo & one Miller lite 19.40. Really? We were seated at a small corner table. Our waiter was less than attentive & not very personable. here are several other restaurants in RI that I would done before going to the Capital Grill again.
February 13, 2015|Food was excellent and the wait staff was terrific|5|We would have been a bit more comfortable with a slightly larger table. Though there were only two of us, the tiny round table forced us to give up the bread basket when our food was served.
January 24, 2015|Always a Great Night|4|Cap Grill Providence did a terrific job, especially because it was restaurant week. We go to the Cap Grill often with family and friends, this was extra great because the food and service, even during a special price week, was just as good. I am also happy to see that they have added a more moderate priced wine list. We will continue to frequent Capital Grills around the country.
January 22, 2015|Food was excellent. Went during restaura...|5|Food was excellent. Went during restaurant week and we're pleased with the choices, quality and service. Would recommend and go back again.
January 22, 2015|Capital Grill has lost its sizzle.|2|The excitement of a sizzling steak served on a 'way too hot to touch' plate is no longer a part of the program at Capital Grill, leaving you with a good quality piece of meat cooked to the desired temp and ... nothing more. The excitement is not there. The sides were an afterthought -- luke warm and none too tasty. The service was perfunctory. One sensed that the gentleman who served us had other places that he'd rather be.
January 21, 2015|Good power lunch location|4|We're big fans of coming to the Capital Grille during Restaurant Week (as we did this time out), because the value is incredible. The burger with truffle fries was quite good, and the creme brûlée was just fantastic. The regular lunch here, if not kept in check, can get very lengthy; our server was very attentive and made sure we were served quickly for every course, since we had only allotted 75 minutes for lunch (she got us in and out in closer to 50 minutes).
January 18, 2015|NFL  Playoff Sunday|5|Dinner was for wife's birthday. Everything went fantastic-Rose petals on table /welcome by maitre'd and waiter. Food was spot on and service was exceptional. Have never been disappointed by Capitol Grille.
January 18, 2015|As always Capital Grille was a Class Act|5|Capital Grille is the best of the best. Service can not be beat. Food cooked to perfection.
January 18, 2015|Delicious|5|We have been there many times. We love it. We will be going back again and again. The food, service, well everything is wonderful!
January 17, 2015|Great service and delicious food|5|We were there during restaurant week. They had amazing dinner options and steak was cooked perfectly. Waitress was very knowledgeable and pleasant. Wine list was diverse as far as price options and flavors. We will definitely go there again sometime soon:)
January 17, 2015|Two weeks later, big difference...|2|I had a glowing review on NYE, thought everything was outstanding and it was great to see the old place packed to the rafters. Went Saturday night for restaurant week with my family and it was completely different - and not for the better. Place was busy, but not packed. We were only given restaurant week menus - does that mean we couldn't order anything else? (No, because we knew what was on the regular menu and ordered from memory.) Almost immediately after ordering, our salads appeared which leads me to believe they were already set to go and this was going to be a mass serving type evening. Steaks and one salmon dish were, honestly, very good. We had to ask for our sides, however, since they were forgotten (kind of an obvious thing - they are two large family style sides - that would be noticeable if absent, right?). Cocktails were good, although the iPad system doesn't list everything. You can get sangria, but you won't see it on their digital library of drinks. Dessert was a disappointment. As great as the creme brulee was on NYE, this night it was runny, cool and not particularly crunchy. I realize it's restaurant week. And I know there's going to be a reset button pushed when they close this location and move to the G Tech building. Still, for a Saturday night in a city with such great restaurants, they clearly called this one in. This would not have been a night I would recommend Capital Grille. Shocked by how much different it was. Will be back, of course, but no longer feel like each time is a grand slam.
January 16, 2015|Restaurant Week|5|What an amazing find! The special for $34.95 was soup or salad...and entree with 2 sides...and a dessert . Everything was wonderful and the service in spite of the crowds was excellent. We will definitely be back before this special is over.
January 16, 2015|Date Night|5|We had a wonderful dinner! Service was great and the food was delicious. We had a very enjoyable experience.
January 16, 2015|Wait staff and food make it special|5|We arrived at out reservation time and it was only moments before we we're taken to our table. Five p.m. And the restaurant was booming! The service was attentive but not annoying. Their drink menu is on an iPad with great photos and descriptions. The steaks were delicious as were the accomplishments. So much food we needed to take our dessert home!
January 14, 2015|Great Lunch on a busy business day|5|My husband and I had an appointment near the Capitol Grille. Since we live over an hour and a half away, we decided to spend the day in Providence. The Capitol Grille was fantastic! The menu had a good selection; the food superb. The service was premium. The wait staff was friendly and helpful! We were not rushed! Would absolutely return
January 13, 2015|50th Birthday|5|Arriving promptly for our 1pm reservation, we were greeted by an enthusiastic hostess in the midst of the lunch crowd. We were seated at a half booth facing the window, as requested, and the birthday was politely acknowledged. Our waiter, Kyle, was attentive and helpful, especially in choosing wine. The food was delicious - never fails - and the birthday dessert plate was a pleasant presentation/surprise. It was a totally satisfying experience and I highly recommend the restaurant!
January 13, 2015|Outstanding|5|"Outstanding in every way. ""Leather and wood"" atmosphere with reminders of the old train station. Service impeccable (friendly but discreet) Steak the best you can get any where. Presentation perfect. Flourless mocha cake melts like silk."
January 9, 2015|A great experience!|4|My wife and I have visited Capital Grille in Providence on multiple occasions, this time for our wedding anniversary. The bone in filet was cooked to perfection - one of the most tender steaks I've ever had - and the vegetables were delicious. Our waiter was available but not too, and his suggestions were appropriate and appreciated.
January 9, 2015|Capital Grille never disappoints!|5|Capital has been my favorite restaurant since it opened in Providence several years ago! I have never been disappointed. To the contrary, it seems to be better every time! The high quality of the food is evident and the presentation is top notch! The wait staff has always been wonderful and more than accommodating. Our family has gathered there over the years for special occasions and will continue to do so in the years to come!
January 2, 2015|ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!|5|My husband and I have been to the Capital Grille in Providence many times, including several times for our wedding anniversary. The service is wonderful. We always feel like we are receiving special treatment. Our table had red rose pedals displayed on it and we received a complimentary desert & champagne toast. My beef and lobster tail was so tender it melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his meal as well. We will return several times over the year and will most likely reserve for our anniversary again.
January 2, 2015|Gone downhill|2|Not what it used to be. The steak was unimpressive. I could get a better steak at half the price at an Italian restaurant on the hill. Unlikely to return.
January 1, 2015|Expensive but worth every penny. Delicio...|5|Expensive but worth every penny. Delicious food, quite generous portions. The ribeye was unbelievably tender, juicy and succulent. Wife was very happy with her swordfish. The twice baked potato was HUGE but so decadent! And our waiter Joel was classy, knowledgable and attentive.
December 31, 2014|Have never seen it so busy!|4|We went for dinner on NYE and the place was packed. Seriously, standing room only at the bar and at one time 30+ people standing near the host stand. It was great to see the place so lively, especially as they get ready to shut it down and move to the old Ruth's space on the corner. While I agree that their space is a little cramped, and they are definitely a little out-dated in terms of decor, it's the best steakhouse in RI. I'd go so far to say it's the best in RI/MA/CT but I haven't been everywhere. The meal was fantastic as always. The bar was over crowded but the cocktails were perfect. The steak tartare was the best I've ever had, anywhere, bar none (chopped onion, truffled deviled egg, steak). I went with my usual kona crusted steak and my guest had a delmonico that she took home a good portion of as a meal for the next day. The truffled fries were perfect (I think between their fries and Grill 23's truffled tater tots potatoes have been perfected) and the creme brulee was flawless. Overall, another great dining experience and I'll be back in 2 weeks for restaurant week. Would recommend to anyone, for any occasion, unless you're a vegetarian. Couple closing notes - new location should be fine, I've heard good things about what they're planning on doing. Also, they're updating their look - iPads now have the wines and cocktails and there's a little bit of awkwardness about it but something we will all get used to. Pricing is still on the higher side, and I know it's a chain, but this restaurant is the heart of the organization and there is something special here. Timeline for the move, as of Christmas, was end of July 2015.
December 31, 2014|Never a disappointment|5|We dined on New years Eve and were seated at the time of our reservation. The wait staff was excellent as always. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience.
December 28, 2014|Special Nught|5|The welcome we received at the door was so special. When we were seated , I wished my brother a happy birthday and the host overheard me and brought very cute decorations for the table. The waitress brought champagne toast before we ordered. The attention my brother received was awesome! A very special birthday and two desert cakes with a candle ! Also the food the four of us ordered was delicious . Thank you for a special night
December 28, 2014|Great Food and Amazing Service|5|I have been to the Capital Grille on several occasions and each time it is truly a dining experience. The wait staff is always accommodating and the food is always great. This is definitely a place for a special occasion for us and not someplace that we would go every week which makes the experience that much better. I would highly recommend it but be sure to bring plenty of money... and dont forget to try the Lobster Mac & Cheese!
Dined on December 27, 2014|special dinner|5|This was our first visit to the Capital Grille, and it will surely be repeated! The menu is pricey (we went all out with lobster and steak), but worth it for a special occasion. The entire experience was fantastic, from when we first arrived and were greeted with rose petals on our table (celebrating our anniversary) to the surprise dessert conclusion. Our server, Ken, was superb! He had the perfect amount of attentiveness - neither hovering nor absent - and was very knowledgeable!
December 27, 2014|Outstanding In All Areas|5|Our first trip to Capital Grille won't be our last. You get what you pay for in fine dining. Capital Grille is pricey but worth every penny. From the moment we walked in and were seated to the moment we left, everything was perfect. The food was excellent across the board. But the best part was that it was a Saturday night and we did not feel rushed at any time. Each course came out at the appropriate time, with adequate time to consume each of them.
December 27, 2014|The best Capital Grille|5|This is the original Capital Grille location and in my opinion the best. We were a party of 6 and had an amazing evening. All of the food was excellent and all of the steaks were cooked exactly as we requested. The service was great as well.
December 26, 2014|Very solid professional service and all ...|5|Very solid professional service and all food was cooked to perfection.
December 24, 2014|Great food, great service!|5|Great food, great service!
December 23, 2014|Upscale dinning at its best|5|The food and service is outstanding, great for a romantic date or dinning with family and friends. good place for entertaining business clients. Dress to impress this place is very classy and upscale. Can be a bit pricy but you should always try to enjoy the finer things in life when ever you possibly can and the Capital Grill will certainly not disappoint!
December 23, 2014|wonderful evening|5|Anniversary dinner.excellent experience starting with rose petals and hearts on lovely corner booth. Great food, never felt rushed.congratulations to us from host and servers.complimentary dessert and champagne was appreciated.overall, wonderful night
December 20, 2014|good but pricey|4|Good service, good food but you can find better values for your money.
December 18, 2014|Fantastic|5|Great food. Fantastic service by Ken. Can't wait to go back.
December 12, 2014|Always terrific|4|Consistency across all aspects, the steaks are always amazing, the service is top-notch and the atmosphere is lively, semi formal to formal but not stuffy.
December 11, 2014|Top Notch!|5|Capital Grille is my favorite restaurant! Has been since it opened several years ago in Providence! Never disappointed! Wait staff is above excellent & chefs are top notch! An easy choice when looking for excellent food & an all around dining experience! I highly recommend it!
December 8, 2014|Never disappoints.|5|I took an associate out who was visiting from out of town. It was a great feeling on a cold rainy night to walk into the warmth of the Capital Grille. Friendly greeting and promptly seated, we both enjoyed perfectly prepared steaks. It's a never miss restaurant with a great staff of people.
December 7, 2014|Good experience as usual|5|I have been to the Capital Grill restaurant several times . I always go whenever there is a special occasion. It keeps its high level of service and good food and encourages me to go again and again.
December 6, 2014|Overall Good Food|3|My husband and I were a little disappointed that we had to wait an hour for our table, despite the fact that we made a reservation at least one week prior. The appetizers were delicious and our dinners were very good. The service was attentive but the server was a little moody at times. Good place for a nice night out but not as quiet as i expected.
December 6, 2014|First Visit|4|This was our first visit to CG, a much anticipated experience but to be honest we were not wow'd. We had heard so much about it. The bread basket is awesome. But I had sea bass and was disappointed. My hubby's steak was over done and a little dry. Given they were extremely busy, but I'm sure this is a regular Saturday night for them. Our server was a little disappointing. He never came to check how we liked our food. And because the bus-boy picked up our dinner plates, the server would not have noticed that I hardly ate my fish. We don't feel that we will go out of our way to eat here again. Bummer :-(
December 5, 2014|Service and Food --- Excellent|5|"This was my first trip to Capital Grille in Providence. I have eaten at their Boston and Chicago restaurants, and by far this was the best overall experience. The service was superb. Unlike the Boston and Chicago sites where the staff tends to convey a feeling of "" doing you a favor"" by serving you, the staff here were genuinely committed to making your experience a memorable one and providing the highest level of service they could. We live in Boston but I can see myself going to Providence more often for this type of dining experience. They just seem to try harder and they nail it. The food was outstanding. Great selection of wine at reasonable prices. We will definitely be going back."
December 5, 2014|night out with a teenager -|4|teenagers are hard to please but he enjoyed the night with dad .... another Father - son dinner was close as well... the lobster\crab cakes are awesome ... I know it is a steak place but we had salmon and tuna .. both were very good ...
November 29, 2014|Excellently enjoyable experience.|5|We had a great time. Everything was cooked to perfection. We were seated in an alcove, which was semi-private and very comfortable. Truly a fine dining experience, well worth the prices.
November 29, 2014|Great steaks|4|Capital Grille is in the league of The Palm and Mortons serving great steaks and Lobster. We were a group of 4 and the calamari was spicy and enough for all of us. Two asked to share the steak with Gorgonzola - no problem, well presented and came warm rare as asked for, agreed one of their best steaks ever. The server had everything memorized from our order to how the food was prepared, could have been a little more attentive but only a little. Also consider sharing, portions are huge Will always consider Capital Grille as a go to restaurant for great food, good atmosphere. It is expensive but if you are willing and able to pay these prices you should be happy with the result.
November 29, 2014|Always Great!|5|Love the Capital Grill-Providence. I take my family there on a regular basis to celebrate milestones such as 18th birthdays and acceptance into college etc. Staff is top notch, led by Ken Johnson, the best waiter I have ever had. 10 out of 10, 5 stars out of 5.....how ever you want to say it, Capital Grill is the BEST!
November 28, 2014|A wonderful 30th anniversary celebration!|5|When making the reservation I mentioned we would be celebrating our 30th in the city where we met. We were greeted with rose petals on our table. Our waiter was outstanding and he surprised us with plate of treats after dinner. A most memorable evening!
November 28, 2014|Had lunch on Black Friday and it was as ...|4|Had lunch on Black Friday and it was as good as ever, the Lobster Bisque is out of this world and the Scallops and Mushroom Risotto is the perfect portion. After a morning of shopping, it is a great place to stop and relax and be energized. Thank you Matt my daughter and I enjoyed our day.
November 27, 2014|Excellent Thanksgiving meal|5|My wife and I had the Thanksgiving prefix with a few sides of soup and veggies. It's seldom you get an absolutely perfect meal, but this was one of those time. Extremely enjoyable.
November 27, 2014|Never disappoints|5|Not being a great fan of traditional Thanksgiving fare, The Capital Grille seemed like a great alternative. We were a group of four and had requested a particular table in the bar area. We were greeted and promptly seated. The rest is the great consistency I have come to enjoy. Friendly service and top quality food served to perfection. I think besides my other visits this could easily be a Thanksgiving tradition.
November 27, 2014|My visit to the restaurant was pleasant.|4|It's difficult to rate a restaurant on a busy occasion like Thanksgiving, so to be fair I would like to express that I had an enjoyable experience. In response to the question would I return? The answer is possibly yes, if only for the convenient location of the restaurant and country club feeling derived from looking at the decor.
November 25, 2014|Special treat|5|A special treat! The salmon is fabulous! Never disappointed!
November 23, 2014|Caesar salad nicely split for us to shar...|5|Caesar salad nicely split for us to share. Filet mignon cooked to perfection with plenty left over to take home for another meal! Porterhouse steak perfectly aged and cooked as ordered (no left overs, though!) Golden beets were a delicious side but may have been a little skimpy on the goat cheese...yummy combination, though! Definitely one of the best experiences we've ever had at the Capital Grille. Thanks for making our 35th anniversary so special.
November 23, 2014|Amazing steakhouse.  The meal was superb...|5|Amazing steakhouse. The meal was superb from start to finish. Great wine and cocktail list. A wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. One of Providence's finest.
November 17, 2014|For a special occasion....worth the extra $$$|4|If you are just looking to satisfy your hunger this is not the place for you.

November 15, 2014|Great Birthday Night|5|This past Saturday night i took my girlfriend out at the Capital Grille Providence for her 33rd birthday celebration. Our table was ready right on time. The shrimp cocktail was huge and excellent. We each had the Kona Encrusted Sirloin which was very tasty and excellent. The sam's mashed are the best every. They also which was a nice touch brought us over a complementary desser for her birthday which consisted of creme brûlée and flour less cake. Overall great experience!
November 14, 2014|First timers - will be back!|5|Our first time at any Capital Grille. A friend highly recommended Providence for our anniversary. Requested a quiet table and mentioned the occasion on the reservation; when we arrived, our table had rose petals on it - such a nice touch! Staff members wished us a happy anniversary. Our waiter - and everyone - was fabulous in terms of service. Attentive without hovering. Good info from the waiter when ordering. Appreciated the offer of flexibility in preparation, but we ended up going with the Chef's Recommendations as is. Food was just incredible and perfectly prepared. Waiter surprised us with champagne and a dessert platter that had everything we loved. We felt like royalty! This is the way to celebrate a special occasion. Can't say enough about our experience.
November 8, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|Had a wonderful evening at The Capital Grill. The food is always consistent and the service is professional and pleasant. Looking forward to returning for another satisfying dinner, worth every penny!
November 4, 2014|A 5 Star Establishment!|5|"Amazing dinner, amazing restaurant. We recently celebrated our 36th Wedding Anniversary here at the Capital Grille in Providence. My wife had the bone-in Filet Mignon and I had the Kona Crusted Delmonico. Each dish was superb! We have been to the establishment many times and we have never been disappointed. Our server, Ken Johnson, paid attention to every detail of our evening even getting into a bit of ""election night"" banter. I would recommend the Capital Grill highly and ask for Ken when making reservations. You will NOT be disappointed."
October 28, 2014|This is my favorite Capital Grille location!|5|The food, service and ambiance is always outstanding!
October 26, 2014|Capped off our 40th!|5|Made my reservation via Open Table and noted it was to celebrate our 40th anniversary. Sometimes a restaurant will give you a little more attention. Capital Grille outdid themselves from the multiple congratulations from the hosts and manager and our waiter, Ken and complimentary glasses of champagne and dessert. Food, as always, was superb with my fillet mignon and the wife's salmon special. My white wine was great and the spouse's Apple martini best she has had in some time. Did I mention the special booth with roses petals?! Capital has the reputation as best in Providence and well deserved. Costs a bit but worth every penny!

October 24, 2014|Mark the waiter|1|Superlative friendly service from all pro waiter. Very helpful with menu and great historic knowledge of Capital Grill
October 19, 2014|Fantastic|5|best dining experience I have had for quite some time. Tiana was our server and was perfect. Friendly, courteous, competent with just the right amount of attention- all this while being fairly new. The manager stopped by a couple times and we told him that Tiana was a keeper. It was a nice touch for him to make sure everything was OK. Food was excellent just as you would expect from a high end steakhouse. Creme Brulee was a tie with 21 Club in NYC for the best I've ever had. Overall a delightful, but not cheap, experience. Great place fo that special occasion. We eill be back.
October 18, 2014|Never Disappoints|5|We always choose The Capital Grille for special occasions. We are never disappointed. One change that need tweaking however, is the new electronic wine list. When we were seated, we asked the hostess for the wine list, expecting the paper one. However, we were told that it was now on a tablet, but it was never brought to us. When our waiter came and asked us if we wanted a drink, we had to ask again for the tablet and then he had to go and get it. The hostesses need to know that if someone asks for the wine list, to bring one.
October 14, 2014|attended to celebrate wedding anniversar...|5|attended to celebrate wedding anniversary. The staff could not have been more friendly. Really enjoyable evenings and extra service was wonderful. Many thanks to all staff who made our celebrations so memorable
Dined on October 11, 2014|Capitol - Experience|4|Great food; excellent service. Bar tenders ok; specialty drink list not tailored to the season.
October 10, 2014|Visited Rhode Island and left Happy|5|I am not one to enjoy a extremely quiet evening at dinner, so from the very beginning I felt comfortable with the noise level. It wasn't too loud nor was it so quiet you have to lean into your spouse to talk because you feel as if the table next to you is listening. The pace at which the food came out was superb. Kevin was our server in the Providence, RI location and he was a delight and was very thorough with the menu descriptions and was open to all questions. My husband's steak was perfect, but mine was MW when I had asked for Med. The manager came around to ask how everything was, he kindly and immediately took my steak and returned with a new Med. cooked steak in 5 minutes. Great service, great food, great staff, great experience.
October 10, 2014|How to Begin a Great Weekend!|5|Friday evenings at the Lounge in the Capital Grille create a special feeling. Phenomenal onion soup adapted to our tastes, tasty salads, and the fantastic Wagyu burger along with the best waitstaff and top-notch entertainment in the lounge are all the components one needs!
October 10, 2014|Fantastic Evening|5|Everything was fantastic. Food was fantastic, service was great. We had a spectacular date night!
October 4, 2014|23rd Anniversary|5|The Capital Grille took care of us from the time I made my reservation. They had our table ready in a very nice area with rose petals on the table. They had my wife's favorite drink brought to the table for her (from my request when making the reservation). Our waiter Tom did a great job so did the table help. All were very friendly and always asking if everything was the way we wanted it.

September 27, 2014|Capital Grille|4|The food and service were outstanding as usual. Not much else to say.
September 27, 2014|Exceptional|5|My wife and I celebrated our fifth anniversary here. I made reservations through Open Table as usual. The table was covered in rose petals, all servers knew it was our anniversary, everything was phenominal. Food was out of this world. I had the filet with poached butter lobster tails and so did my wife. That dish is so delicious words do not suit it. The coconut creme pie was for dessert, I highly recommend it!!! Overall, 5 star visit!
September 24, 2014|Perfect|5|Need we say more? Expensive, yes. Worth it? We think so.
September 20, 2014|Second great evening in one week|5|We so enjoyed dinner at The Capital Grille, Providence - that we returned on our last evening in the city. Again - it was delightful. It was a Saturday night - energy and noise was multiplied - and it was hard to talk with my husband across the small table. We gave up trying to talk for the most part and saw other couples doing same. The restaurant was so busy there were some challenges - we felt a bit rushed by staff - clearly anxious to keep tables turning - and two people offered us fresh cracked pepper - the second started to grind without waiting for the answer - we both dove to save the meat. Then the manager stopped by - and offered to send for our waiter to bring fresh cracked pepper... So I'd recommend a weeknight visit, not Sat.
September 20, 2014|Beyond Amazing!!|5|Everything about our visit was perfection..Our waiter, Mark, made sure everything was beyond our expectations!! Food was outstanding!! Steak tartare, Delmonico for me...couldn't have been any better..steak cooked perfectly!! Lobster bisque (loaded with lobster!!) and porterhouse for my husband also the best!! When they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, we said not tonight but a big anniversary in a couple of weeks..we assumed just conversation ..Nope!! We were surprised with a beautiful dessert platter with Happy Anniversary stenciled in chocolate!! Beautiful and so appreciated!! But, to top it off, we were given champagne glasses to take home to use on our actual anniversary!! Can't say enough how perfect the night was!!
September 20, 2014|Out of this world!|5|This place is out of this world fantastic! I wish I could give it 10 stars. I have always heard wonderful things about the Capital Grille so was looking forward to trying it. We eat out quite a bit and it is one place I have not eaten at before. Exceeded expectations. It was my husband's birthday so I asked if we could have a romantic table. Well, not only did we get that, everyone wished him happy birthday, there were little sparkly foil leaves on the table when we arrived, we received a free glass of champagne and dessert. Our server, Josh, was awesome! Very attentive, friendly, and just made the night that much more special. The food was terrific. A big thumbs up. Many thanks for a very special evening!!
September 17, 2014|This is a GREAT Capital Grill|5|We arrived in Providence tired and ready for dinner - - we opted for the capital grill because it is reliable - and it was close to our hotel. And days later we are still talking about our evening there. Everything was great and our waiter helped us unwind from our travels. We were able to relax and enjoy a memorable evening together. everyone - from the hostess to other waiters we passed as we left - smiled and acknowledged us kindly. We left feeling so much better than when we arrived - with a really great meal to boot! Thanks for being the highlight of our trip.
September 17, 2014|well prepared food, extensive wine list,...|5|well prepared food, extensive wine list, my only complaint was a food being served barely lukewarm.
September 16, 2014|Great|5|Great service and made our special occasion memorable.
September 13, 2014|Outstanding service|5|Outstanding service by our waiter Mark and bartender Tim. Expensive, but you know that if you know anything about The Capitol Grill. But, you also know the good, service and dining experience is outstanding.
September 13, 2014|Great evening|4|Went for a special anniversary. The entire staff seemed to take the time to offer congratulations. Rose petals on our reserved table. We were seated near a large party of approx. 20, made the noise level very high.
September 11, 2014|Never disappoints|4|We go to Capital Grille for many special occasions. We are never disappointed. Service, food, wine. All good!
September 10, 2014|Menu is considerably over-priced. Food i...|3|Menu is considerably over-priced. Food is reasonably good although the steak tartar appetizer was far too piquant and the serving was far too large for an appetizer - and of course the price was commensurately high. The serving was bulked up with excessive egg, capers, onions. Entree prices were very high relative to the quality of the items and were again larger than necessary serving sizes. Service was excellent.
September 6, 2014|Wonderful evening|5|Great food and warm friendly service- will not disappoint for a special occasion.
September 5, 2014|Royal Treatment|5|My son's choice for his 23rd Birthday. It was wonderful. We all enjoyed the evening, food, service and experience. We expect nothing less from Capital Grille, we were treated like we where family.
September 2, 2014|Great Service & Food|5|My wife and I had dinner on our wedding anniversary. We could not have been treated better or made to feel more special. Service was outstanding and the food matched it. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant !

August 23, 2014|Great for Waterfire nights!|4|Food was top notch..however out of asparagus at 7pm?? 2 dinners 2 sides no alcohol $180 Great time..not rushed.
August 20, 2014|Great|5|Never disappointed. I have always a great meal and great service no matter the size of the party.
August 17, 2014|Over-Priced|3|We went on a Sunday night - very few people there. The restaurant is elegant and understated. Service - while not immediate - was very good overall - lacking small details such as not removing used sweetener packets until the end of the meal. Biggest disappointment was the food - not that it was bad, but it does not merit the extraordinarily high prices charged. Our bill, including tip, was $190.00. This was with one appetizer and one dessert, which we split, one glass of wine, two entrees and two sides. The heirloom tomato and mozzarella appetizer was OK, the tomatoes were good, but the mozzarella was at best pedestrian. Our entrees (sliced filet and lamb chops) were ordered medium but came medium-well. Dessert was OK.
August 15, 2014|Never Disappoints|5|Brought some people who had never been before, they were blown away. The food from beginning to end was perfect. Kona crusted bone in sirloin is the best steak I've had anywhere. The Capital Grill finds away to exceed my expectations every time.
August 12, 2014|Best Birthday Dinner Ever|5|"My sixteen year old daughter wanted a ""fancy dinner"", and chose Capitol Grille. The ambience, table setting, food and service were exceptional and without flaw. This is a dinner she will never forget."
August 9, 2014|won't go back|2|Too bright, mediocre service, food unerwhelmed, over priced. Loaded with 'special occasion' diners - HS and/or college graduation, retirement party, kid's b'day dinner, HS proms probably in the spring, etc.
August 9, 2014|Although we had to be an HOUR late for o...|5|Although we had to be an HOUR late for our reservation -- they held our table by the window with a nice view, as I had requested!! That was really nice of them. We were also given a champagne toast for the birthday dinner and a plate with desserts at the end of the meal that had happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate!! Nice. Food was good - service was done well - great night!!
August 9, 2014|Good as always|5|"My wife I had dinner here for her birthday and we had a fantastic meal. I am rarely let down by the Capital Grille. The one surprise (and it is was positive) was that we decided to try ""the Generous Pour"" wine selection they are offering this summer. It was actually a really good deal, which is not something I usually walk away from the Capital Grille saying. $25 per person to try several wines and then have glasses of those you like the most was a great way to sample some wines. I would highly recommend it."
August 2, 2014|Great Food and Service|5|Food and service was fantastic . Atmosphere is loud
July 29, 2014|First Date|5|I meet a woman it was a our first date and i normal would pick a nice resturant but this was top five nice in all of new england. she was sophisticated and intelligent. so that being said the crowd there is very upscale and please dress nice not jeans and a nice shirt nice but slacks wingtips and collard shirt nice. a must have is the wine tasting. but i ordered a champaign bottle much better then by the glass. truffle fries aren't as good as a years ago when i went there but that would be my only complaint and if you have to complain about the prices. you really should go or have gone to another place. this place is it when you won't to splurge.
July 26, 2014|Perfect Night!|5|What a treat! I took my boyfriend here for a birthday surprise, and the two of us shared a leisurely dining experience with the most pleasant server. From start to finish, everything was divine. The blue crab cocktail melted in your mouth, as did the kona-crusted steaks and butter-poached lobster tails. Seating outside is especially nice, and even though there are people walking by and close enough to talk with, it doesn't feel intrusive. We were there on a full-lighting WaterFire night, and the restaurant is within a minute walk from one end of the display. I wanted this to be a special night, and The Capital Grille raised the bar! Thank you!!
July 25, 2014|We were at the Providence,RI Capital Gri...|5|We were at the Providence,RI Capital Grill. It is a favorite. This one is lively and fun even for older folks like us. We were celebrating an anniversary and our waiter,Ronny, could not have been finer, even bringing us dessert and champagne as a gift on the house. Also has a great location near Waterfire for which Providence is famous.
July 25, 2014|Lovely|3|Wonderful evening dining outside with music sung by Tony Cerbo Food was good as was service but neither were outstanding.
July 19, 2014|Great experience!|5|I celebrated my birthday at the Capital Grille with 6 of my best friends and it was a wonderful experience. Our server was excellent- funny, friendly and attentive. But the true reason to go here is for the food! It is to die for! The steaks are cooked perfectly and the flourless chocolate cake will be something I dream about for months to come. I'm definitely going back!
July 19, 2014|Anniversary|5|My husband and I went with another couple to celebrate both of our Anniversarys. Was amazing, food was wonderful and the service was awesome. We have never been, we will be back. If your looking for a special night out with your spouse, this is the place--great food, great wine--you will not want to leave. At the end they came out with cheese cakes and Happy Anniversay spelled out in chocolate---so yummy. Getting all dressed up and having great food and wine is the way to go! Love it we will be back!
July 19, 2014|Excellent Evening|4|Had a wonderful dining experience with my wife as we celebrated our anniversary. From the moment we entered the restaurant we felt like special guests at someone's home. The staff went out of their way to acknowledge our special occasion and to make the night memorable. Our waiter, Matt, was super attentive and allowed us to dine at a very enjoyable pace. From the hostess, to the bus boy, and all the way up to the general manager everyone was professional and friendly. The food was absolutely wonderful. Everything was prepared precisely to our liking and tasted wonderful. I've dined at most of the fine restaurants here in Providence, but I'd have to say that the Capital Grille is certainly in my top three. Well done Capital Grille!
Dined on July 19, 2014|You won't be disappointed|5|We had a wonderful experience at the Capital Grill. A strong pour at the bar, being seated at our table on time, a very thorough and friendly waiter, and then the food itself, which was just perfect.

July 18, 2014|Another Perfect Evening|5|Capital Grille's Outside Dining on a Friday night cannot be beat with great food and Tony Cerbo 's entertainment!
July 18, 2014|Love the guys on the bar at the grille. ...|5|Love the guys on the bar at the grille. All super friendly and can have a chat with you over lunch. The only small negative is that they end the lunch menu early. Pity they didn't offer it until 3:30 as some of us like a later lunch with drinks... Chose off the bar menu instead.
July 17, 2014|Very good service-OK food.|4|Service was very good-food was fine-just did not knock my socks off as it has before.
July 16, 2014|Great Service, Food, and Ambience|5|Great place for a special occasion. Prices are high, but that is compensated by the excellent food and service
July 16, 2014|Excellent Service|5|Very efficient, non-invasive service. Excellent waitperson (Meaghan) was extremely professional.
July 15, 2014|A Great Evening Out|4|We went during Providence Restaurant Week, besides being a bargain it was a delicious meal. Loved the rich and creamy clam chowder and the Caesar's salad. The service as expected was friendly and cordial. We each had the sirloin steak and they were perfectly cooked as ordered. The mashed potatoes were creamy, the string beans had a nice crunch to them, The basket of bread had a nice selection. The cheese cake was a good ending to a great meal.
July 15, 2014|Very accommodating|5|The food and service were outstanding. We had to change the time of our reservation at the last minute and they were very accommodating despite it being restaurant week and extremely busy. We had a party of seven and every individual enjoyed their meal choice. The portions were just right and the meal options were varied. The service was attentive and at no point was there a beat missed nor did anyone feel rushed. I would definitely dine here again.
July 15, 2014|Terrific in all respects!|5|Four of us decided to have lunch here as part of restaurant week in Providence. We were not disappointed. The choices on the menu gave a idea of the quality that The Capital Grille is renown for. The food was excellent in all respects. We'll definitely return.
July 13, 2014|Really exceptional food|5|I always dismiss this place as a chain of sorts, but every time I'm back, I remember that it has really great food. Even being here for restaurant week, where quality amongst some places undoubtedly drop, the service and food remained outstanding-will be back soon!
July 13, 2014|not so good servive|1|Food was very good as usual. The service was bad. We were asked if we would like additional sides. We said yes and they never came. They just collected our dishes. We were not asked if they could validate our parking ticket until we asked them. They supposedly validated it but had to pay $11 to get out. There was no validation. Even getting water was slow.
July 12, 2014|Great Meal|5|Outstanding meal, service and ambiance! Both the Kona steak and the salmon were excellence, and we always love to dine outside if we can get a seat.
July 12, 2014|Pleasant surprise|1|We hit restaurant week without knowing ! What a super deal. Everything was perfect from food to service to dining outside in July!
July 11, 2014|Our dining experience was decent, howeve...|3|Our dining experience was decent, however, the service was truly terrible. It took our waiter over 10 minutes to greet us and over 30 to place our order. This continued throughout our meal. He did not apologize, nor would he even make eye contact with us as he passed. When spending so much money, you hope to be treated special, and this was the opposite.
July 11, 2014|Outstanding Evening!|5|"My husband and I made reservations and requested a particular server who happened to be working outside this evening. It was a beautiful night and to our surprise there was live entertainment outside as well!! We had a fabulous dinner and participated in the ""Generous Pour"" which was a real treat! We danced to the tunes of Frank Sinatra and truly had a wonderful time."
July 11, 2014|First disappointing visit|2|"We have been to this restaurant many times and have given it very good reviews prior to this. 1. We were not seated where we requested although there were tables in that station that remained available throughout our meal. 2. Approximately 10 minute wait to be greeted by our server who then said he would be with us in a few minutes. 3. A different server brought our our steaks while my wife had 1/2 of her chowder still in the bowl and asked her, while she was literally taking a spoonful, ""Do you want to hold onto that for a while?"" He then waited for my wife to move her bowl so he could set down the steaks. 4. Salad with steak was soggy and seemed to have been dressed for a long while."
July 10, 2014|Anniversary dinner|5|Took advantage of Providence Restaurant Week to try some place a little out of our price range. We were not disappointed! The food and service were terrific! The noise level was pretty loud, so it was not as easy to carry on quiet conversation. Overall, excellent!

July 9, 2014|I love restaurant week|4|It was restaurant week. The menu even restricted had enough choices for every taste. The service was outstanding and the sirloin steak owas tender and juicy cooked to perfection. For once the green beans were crunchy but cooked, and the mashed potatoes were like velvet. Because we started with a delicious Cesar salad , we could not handle the dessert which we took home in a nice box and a small brown bag. I had the dessert two days later and the chocolate espresso cake tasted as fresh as the day it was made. In conclusion a very positive experience.
July 9, 2014|What a Perfect Night!!!|5|Everything was Fabulous from the moment we walked in the door, our table looked beautiful with rose petals all over, to the yummy drinks, the food was absolutely delicious and the dessert was to die for and a big shout out to our server Nicole Egan for making our first of many visits to The Capitol Grille a very memorable one, everyone was friendly, asked how the food was, even struck up conversations about other things, it was very relaxed and comfortable evening. I felt very fancy but yet down to earth, my husband and I will definitely be back to dine!!! Thank you 😊
July 9, 2014|Great Lunch|5|The Staff here are wonderful. Polite, friendly and very helpful. We were there for lunch and it was served at a very leisurely pace. The food was excellent. The restaurant is very elegant inside. It is a great special occasion restaurant. The acoustics are not ideal and at times I could hear a hum of conversations in the background. However to put this in perspective it is very typical of restaurants in general.
July 8, 2014|Superb food and service|5|Although our visit was during restaurant week, the food and service were superb.

July 6, 2014|One of the Best in RI|5|Enjoyed a great meal and perfect service while dining with my wife, sister, and brother-in-law. Perfect place for many different occasions.
June 28, 2014|Anniversary dinner|5|The food and service was wonderful. The restaurant went out of their way to make our anniversary feel special. We received champagne, appetizer, and dessert free of charge along with our table decorated with rose petals. I definitely plan on going here for future special occasions. I expected the food and service to be excellent and they did not disappoint. The restaurant exceeded my expectations with the little attention to details.
June 28, 2014|Had a wonderful time.|5|We were a little skeptical about visiting a restaurant which is part of a chain. We had negative experiences at other restaurants such as Flemings, who are part of a chain. But The Capital Grille was the complete opposite. The staff was wonderful, the food was delicious, and the environment was clean and comfortable. My wife and i would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and we definitely would become repeat customers.
June 28, 2014|satisfied/ disapointed|4|The ambince was verygood we had window seating, our server Joshua B. was outstanding it was my wifes birthday and he treated her great even gave her a birthday desert. I had the portherhouse and my wife had the filet migon both med meaning hot pink center which i felt was not cooked to a guality of a high level steakhouse, the beef looked like it was cooked at a low temp/ broiler outside of our beef had little color and 3/4 of our beef was med well. I would have expected our beef to be cooked at 1100' to give it a good seared.
June 21, 2014|Always fantastic!|5|We love the service, the extra little perks (free: lobster appetizer!!!!) and the food is always perfect!!!
June 17, 2014|Birthday|5|Took my son out for his 21st birthday. The wait staff went well above and beyond what I had expected! On top of that the food was excellent.
June 14, 2014|anniversary celebration|5|Went there for our anniversary. Very professional but friendly at the same time. The appetizers and meal were outstanding and our waiter Joel was excellent. Would love to try this experience again.
June 14, 2014|outstanding|5|I live in CT and was in RI to visit and came here for dinner let me tell you that was one of the beat meals I have had in a long time. Will definitely come back
June 14, 2014|Dined Saturday 6/14|3|We celebrated my birthday and Fathers day as we always do. Food is always fantastic as well as the service. Out Waiter was excellent. Our food was perfect until my hisbands steak arrived at the tabler. He ordered the Steak Special Medium and it was cooked well done. The steak was taken back and cooked another one, but my meal was already there. We ordered AuGratin Potato and we where served Mashed. We shared my steak. The right order of Potatoes came to us 3/4 of the way throught the meal. Husband steak was brought to the table still not cooked properly now it was to rear. This has to be one of our favorite resturants in RI and we where disappointed.
June 14, 2014|Upon entering we were asked what was the...|5|Upon entering we were asked what was the occasion for our visit. We explained that we are celebrating our birthdays. The wait staff decorated our table with birthday confetti and everyone that interacted with us wished us a happy birthday. When finished with our exquisite meal, the waiter and manager came over quietly with a happy birthday plate holding two delicious pieces of pastry and wished us a Happy Birthday. What a nice surprise! Between the food, wait staff, and finishing touches, our experience was very satisfactory. I would definitely dine here again.
June 7, 2014|If It's Steak You Want...|5|There's no place else to go for the best. Very expensive, but you know that going in. The food, the preparation, the service is top shelf. Aside from food related elements, I particularly like the layout of the restaurants. Every table provides comfort, privacy, and even intimacy in a busy space. I hate the restaurants that seat you on top of one another. If you're into a splurge...Cap Grille is tough to beat...
June 7, 2014|Outstanding!|5|We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. The waiter was awesome! The food is above average. The bread basket is so... good. The steaks are outstanding! They gave us free desserts with champagne to celebrate our special day. There were rose petals on the table when we arrived. We go to Providence quite often as we love to eat at Federal Hill. The Capitol Grill is expensive but it's worth every penny. We will return without a doubt. An outstanding establishment in the heart of Providence. This place does not disappoint.
June 4, 2014|Business Lunch|5|Unless you are familiar with Providence, it can be hard to find as it is below ground and between buildings. However, this makes for a very nice place to meet. The service was outstanding with refreshed drinks being presented before the last sip was even taken and the food was excellent. Highly recommend for any occasion but mine was only for lunch.
May 30, 2014|Spectacular!|5|Celebrated another birthday with friends and everything was perfection . Great place to have a SPECTULAR dinner . Waitstaff are very professional and helpful. Can't say enough about it. Will be coming back for sure!!!!
Dined on May 28, 2014|Tim our waiter deserves 10 stars|5|We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and my wifes' s birthday. Tim gave us amazing unrushed service and the food was absolutely to die for. Tim even gave us a complimentary desert in recognition of our anniversary. Oh, the hostess also spread rose petals all over our table to recognize our special events. It was a night we will always remember! All positive, too!
May 24, 2014|girlslunchgabfest|5|Outstanding anniversary dinner, food, service, atmosphere all perfection.
May 23, 2014|pricey but good|5|food was excellent but extremely expensive...but perfect steak
May 17, 2014|Great graduation dinner|5|Took a group of 8 to celebrate my daugher's college graduation. The dinner could not have possibly been nicer. Ken, our waiter, was outstanding. The steaks, as always, were delicious. We will absolutely be back for my son's graduation dinner in about 51 weeks!
May 16, 2014|1 year anniversary |5|The food was amazing. The staff were friendly and knowledgable. They allowed me to drop of flowers to put on the table as well as serving our wedding cake for dessert.
May 11, 2014|Excellent!|5|Great food, great service. I have never been disappointed! Staff are very accommodating!
May 9, 2014|Wonderful|5|Wonderful! We celebrated my son's 19th birthday and mother's day! They made it special. Decorated the table with 2 cards and rose petals. They gave a beautiful dessert plate with 2 diff cakes and choc happy bday on plate.also 2 champagne glasses. Wonderful evening!
May 8, 2014|Dependably Great|5|I haven't had the opportunity to dine here in awhile and it was nice to see them still playing at the top of their game
May 3, 2014|50th Birthday celebration|5|It was my husbands 50th birthday and he had never been to the capitol grille before. I've been a few times with friendsand I just love the food and the atmosphere. It was a surprise and he was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. My 3 young children also came along and were excited to dress up and absolutely loved the steak, they also got a lobster dish. Our waiter was phenomenal and also brought a birthday surprise that was very unexpected . All in all it was a fabulous experience! We will definitely be back soon.
May 3, 2014|Good Night Out for a Special Night|4|The salads and steaks are terrific. The staff goes out of their day to make regular guests and new diners feel very welcome. This is my favor Capital Grille on the East Coast!
May 3, 2014|Five Star food, not on service|5|Excellent food, mediocre service for the price. Took a full 15 mins after everyone put their forks down to get attention. This was particularly awkward since it was a birthday. a dinner for 4 at over $500 (no drinks) I'd expect better service.
May 2, 2014|Would like more of a variety of salads a...|4|Would like more of a variety of salads and soup - a healthy menu should also be available.
May 1, 2014|FOOD NOT THAT GREAT..|2|Tonight, my experience was between average to below average. The calamari (pan fried according to the menu) was deep fried with lots of oil. To the point, that we did not finish it. I ordered the sirloin and lobster tail entree. Even though, I asked for medium rare, the steak came medium to medium well. The flavor was ok, nothing spectacular. The lobster tails were AMAZING.. We got a sample of the cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake since we were celebrating a special occasion and the former was very nicely done. The latter was a bit dense and heavy for my taste. The waiter was top notch. Very good service, attentive and polite. Service is Five Stars Food quality is about Three Stars
April 29, 2014|Great dining experience|5|We recently had a great dining experience. Our waiter, Dan, was fabulous. Food and wine were great. They did a wonderful job for our special occasion.
April 26, 2014|Husband's 50th Birthday|4|Consistently good. Had appetizers elsewhere, and came here for the great steak dinner my husband wanted while celebrating his 50th birthday. Our steaks were cooked just as we requested. Mine with the au poivre sauce was especially tasty and not something I would think to make at home. The truffle fries are great, and their au gratin potatoes very delicious, but their cream spinach was not as good as I remembered. The service as always was right on queue. Great night.
April 20, 2014|Great for Easter|5|We have tried numerous restaurants for Easter Brunch & this year, The Capital Grille, was excellent! The food,as always, was superb and the service great and we will be back next year for Easter.
April 20, 2014|Professional & Polished|4|Impeccable service. Elegant setting. Food expertly prepared. More traditional than contemporary preparations.
April 18, 2014|Average|2|"The steak was average, at best. Served broiled ""au jus"" it was more reminiscent of a roast beef presentation. Where's the ""Grille"" ! Additionally, for a 22oz Delmonico, it was quite thin, not suited for medium rare preparation. Lastly, the presentation 'rubs"" which can be added to any steak is confusing. I asked myself why this is necessary; a good charcoal broiled steak needs nothing. Having had a steak prepared each way, the ""rub gives it taste. The ordinary preparation is quite bland. Frankly, I scan make a comparable steak at home. Have been to a large number of high end steak houses, this ranks close to the bottom."
April 18, 2014|Great Night Out|5|The service at Capital Grille is above and beyond! The food was excellent. It was the perfect night to celebrate our anniversary!
April 16, 2014|Always consistent Capital Grille|5|The Capital Grille formula working well in Providence. Good people make all the difference. Great steak tartar app and great steaks and sides as always.
April 14, 2014|Impeccable|5|This restaurant is the best in class in the Providence/Southcoast area. Hands down. From hostess stand to busboy to waiter to runner, the staff training is consistent and excellent. The food is of the same quality.
April 12, 2014|Great night!|4|The Capital Grill is a great spot for a Saturday night out. Top shelf food and service with an atmosphere that's going on in town. Always good for the dining room experience or in the bar area too.
April 12, 2014|Getting too Big?! Disappointing.|3|"Capital Grille used to be our go to places for many special occasions over the past 15 years but THESE days visiting there doesn't seem so special AND the quality of the food seems to have diminished. The last two times we have been the creamed spinach was overly salted (and not very creamy) and additionally the steak wasn't the usual melt-in -your mouth cut we have gotten accustomed to. Not sure we'll go back...with those prices you EXPECT to walk away satisfied. Perhaps it's suffering from chain ownership's all to typical lack of attention to detail (Owned by the same group that owns the Olive Garden) or maybe it's just dumb luck ( the past couple visits...not sure but not sure I want to give them an opportunity for a ""third strike""."
April 12, 2014|A perfect evening|5|My husband and I had a perfect evening celebrating our anniversary at Capital Grille. I had mentioned the anniversary on my reservation and we were greeted and wished a Happy Anniversary from everyone :the hostess, waiter, and the manager. There were rose petals on the table! Cocktails, wine and steaks were superb! My husband loved the Kona rubbed sirloin. Dessert was on the house. What a lovely evening!
April 10, 2014|A consistent go-to restaurant!|5|Capital Grille is my go-to restaurant when I want a great meal. Always terrific service and quality meals. I like to sit at the bar, where Bobby or Paul are always personable and make you feel welcomed.
April 7, 2014|Business Dinner at the Bar|5|Great food, great wine and we were well taken care of by one of the best bar staffs in the business!
April 5, 2014|Phenomenal!|5|It was our anniversary and the Capital Grille went above and beyond. Champagne toast, complimentary dessert, and Tom's service was the finest I've ever had. Can't wait to return!
April 5, 2014|Wonderful dinner experience|4|We felt special when they served a complimentary dessert to honor our 5th Anniversary.
April 5, 2014|Sat dinner|5|Greeted warmly by vibrant staff and led to our table immediately after being given the option of getting a drink at the bar first. Excellent service all around. Food was even better! I requested the lamb rib chops cooked with the porcini/olivi oil rub and they accommodated my request to perfection. My only observation of less than perfection was the cherry reduction, which I did not think we well with the lamb. We always go the Capital Grille in either Boston or Providence but Boston was booked up for a last minute reservation for 2. No, I don't work there, but we always go to the Capital Grille for special occasions, and they never let us down!
April 5, 2014|Excellent|5|Excellent food and service. Calamari, crab, salmon, steaks and sides were all great! Everyone in our party loved it.
April 3, 2014|Great for Groups!|5|Our group of 6 went there on a Thursday evening. We were seated quickly. We received good advice from our waiter on menu items. Once we placed our orders the food came out quickly and very pleasing to the eye. But yet there was more - it tasted wonderful! The service was attentive but not intrusive. I highly recommend this location - which BTW is the original Capital Grille.
April 2, 2014|Food coma, but in a good way|5|My fiancé and I had dinner at The Capital Grille Providence to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. We had an amazing experience, starting with our waiter Ken. He knew the menu so well, and made excellent suggestions on both food and wine. The food could not have been prepared any better. Everything was delicious and the attention to detail was apparent. Ken was a top notch server- both knowledgeable and personable. It was a A+++ experience. We have already decided this would be our anniversary dinner every year!
March 28, 2014|Fantastic!|5|We went to Capital Grill to celebrate my husbands birthday. Every aspect of the dinner was amazing. The food was phenomenal and we will definitely be going back again.
March 27, 2014|Oh what an experience!|5|My wife and I visited the Capital Grille to celebrate my birthday. We sat at the bar because we love the atmosphere though our table experiences have been good. The bartenders are so good, so attentive and helpful that our dining experience was guaranteed to be special. From the wonderful smoked salmon appetizer to the perfect Delmonico steak to the richly fulfilling desserts the quality of the food here is exceptional! Our particular thanks to Bobby and Paul for making this a great way to celebrate getting a year older!
March 22, 2014|Excellent location, wonderful|5|Excellent location, wonderful food & amazing service. Convenient parking- easier than Boston!
March 22, 2014|Another Great Dinner at CG|4|I will start with saying that if someone told me I had one meal left and I could eat it anywhere I wanted, it would probably be at the Capital Grille in Providence. So when I was thinking about meeting several friends to celebrate between Waterford, CT and Boston it had to be CG in Prov. Most of the party started with Stoli Dolis. Can't really go wrong there. For dinner the order of the night was steaks. The special sirloin had a Caribbean spice that both people who ordered thought was good but not great The kona rubbed Delmonico was awesome. On the other side, both of our party that ordered filet had to send it back as they were both cold. A first for me at CG. This is why the overall only rated a 4.
March 21, 2014|Perfect evening!|5|I wanted to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with a very special surprise dinner. After reading the reviews of the Capitol Grille, and knowing how much my boyfriend loves his steak, I thought this might be the perfect place. I am absolutely delighted to say that I was right! From the excellent table, to the birthday card on the table for my boyfriend and the absolutely incredible attentive service from Tim the entire evening, the unbelievably delicious and perfectly cooked steaks, to the Happy Birthday dessert, this was truly an experience we will never forget. It's nearly a week later and we are still raving about it! I really hope he takes me there for MY birthday! All in all it was a perfectly fantastic evening. Bravo!
March 16, 2014|Excellent Service|5|The food as always is consistently good. But the reason that keeps us going back is the wonderful service with Eric. He is both knowledgeable and attentive - making our dining experience so enjoyable.
March 15, 2014|As usual, a wonderful place|5|As usual, a wonderful place to celebrate any occasion. They always make the effort to say Happy Birthday and present a special birthday dessert. It is expensive, but worth the money since the food is wonderful and the total experience makes a special day
March 14, 2014|An evening you can count on|5|Well done as usual, great hostess staff upon entering the restaurant, great waiter, great food, great wine. What else do you need?
Dined on March 14, 2014|Girls nite out|5|3 friends out before a show enjoyed great laughs , great food, and excellent. We were seated at the bar and when we were brought to our table it was decorated with rose petals. I never thought anything more when I made the reservation and said we Han a birthday in our party. To end everything we were presented with champagne and dessert! What a great touch to make you feel special. Thanks for going above and beyond!
March 14, 2014|Outstanding Service|5|I was really blown away by the outstanding service that I received at CG in Providence. The entire staff was attentive, personable and extremely professional. My group was celebrating a special occasion and all of the staff made a point to stop by the table and congratulate the celebrant.
March 12, 2014|great time|5|the evening dining here was great from a to z waiter was exceptional
March 8, 2014|Nothing but amazing|5|Built for excellence , everything was just a dream form the moment you walk in thank you guys no matter how packed everyone gets treat like they are the only ones there.
March 4, 2014|Great service|5|Very attentive, and respectf of business conversation.
March 1, 2014|Loved the energy!|5|The last few Capital Grille locations I've visited have just been okay, but not Providence. It was wonderful! Loved the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail, had a wonderful server who had the chef turn a special entree into an appetizer for us and although some may say it was noisy, I loved the buzz and high energy of the room. Will be back!
February 14, 2014|Fantastic|5|As always, everything from the food to service was top rate!!
February 14, 2014|Steak was undercooked. Sent|1|Steak was undercooked. Sent back...still undercooked. Did not feel like sending it back twice. Would not do that to the chef...Also, water glasses were never refilled and I had to ask for a refill of my drink. I think they need a refresher course in cooking/service. Definitely not going back.
February 14, 2014|valentine's|5|we had a very nice time- even on a busy night. Hostesses greeted us warmly- We had a wonderful table and the food was delicious
February 14, 2014|Bad choice for Valentines|2|Bad choice for Valentines Day. Overcrowded and overpriced.
February 14, 2014|steak was cooked incorrectly|3|steak was cooked incorrectly twice and was removed from bill
February 14, 2014|Over rated and highly over|3|Over rated and highly over priced. While this is a good solid restaurant they have pushed prices beyond the middle class. Dinner for two approached $200 without ordering over the top. Food is good. Ambience is clouded by their desire to fill every space w patrons. We'll go back perhaps every few years but not likely before.
February 8, 2014|Was quite disappointed that|2|Was quite disappointed that despite making a reservation it still took 20 minutes to be seated. Once taken to our table, we had to awkwardly wait in the middle of other diners while the table was set. The service was fair, but much lower than my experiences at the locations in the DC area. The service is better at the Cheesecake Factory nearby. I asked for the fliet mignon to be prepared medium well and it was very well done. Overall, a dismal experience given the expense.
February 8, 2014|You Can't Go Wrong|5|The Capital Grille - Providence is our go-to great overall experience restaurant. The service is impeccable. Cocktails are perfectly prepared and served. Apps, soups, salads, steaks, fish and sides are all delicious and generously sized. Great wine list by the bottle and glass. Let them know ahead of time if this is a special occasion, B'day, Anniversary, etc. they'll do something extra to help you celebrate. Free parking too!
February 7, 2014|OVER & ABOVE|5|Capital Grille Providence has it all: great location, food, drinks, service & ambiance. The staff seems to be very personable & friendly. Everyone from the greeters, coat check, and waiters go out of their way to make sure you're satisfied. Wonderful experience!
February 6, 2014|Special dinner at Capital Grille|4|Always an enjoyable experience for a special celebration.
January 25, 2014|outstanding|5|I've been here about 4 times.. this time was restaurant week.. the food and the service cannot be beat by any restaurant around.
January 24, 2014|Fantastic Evening in Every Way!|5|A wonderful evening celebrating a birthday and a graduation - food was fantastic especially since it was restaurant week special menu and reasonable prices. Singer Tony Cerbo was in the lounge making the night ultimate perfection.
January 23, 2014|Outstanding food and service.|5|Outstanding food and service. A great experience !!!
January 20, 2014|60 th birthday lunch|5|Took 4 friends for a birthday lunch --hostess Jessica was FANTASTIC helping planning it. Food was great. Service was very good -a few little things but nothing keeping us from returning. Food was great as always. Always a great place to go to for special time. Is on the high end but worth every $$$.
January 18, 2014|Excellent|5|My husband and I ate at the Capital Grille on Saturday night during Providence Restaurant Week and enjoyed it immensely. There were several different choices on the special menu, and we both had the 14 oz. sirloin steak which was cooked perfectly. The restaurant was crowded, but we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time and never felt rushed during our meal. Our waiter was wonderful, funny and attentive. For the $29.95 per person Restaurant Week deal, it was well worth the trip!
January 18, 2014|Capital grill|4|Food and service were terrific!! It was quite noisy at our table. Also there is no place to stand/ sit while waiting for to be seated, bar was packed and hostess station crowded as well. Great steaks!!
January 18, 2014|Restaurant week|5|Good value during restaurant week. Always fun to try different places.
January 18, 2014|we went there for the restaurant|5|we went there for the restaurant week. great food. great service. the only thing I could possibly suggest to the restaurant is that if they could reduce the number of people coming to the table to ask how we were doing it would be great (our dinner and conversation was interrupted about dozen times in the course of 2-3 hours)... but this is a minor flaw - do give them a try if you have never been there. they are fantastic.
January 17, 2014|Restaraunt week|5|For restaraunt week, it was super busy, however the food and service was phenomenal
January 17, 2014|Good food but always a wait|3|Went there on a Friday night with an 8:15 reservation. At 8:15 was told table was being set, but after a few inquiries could tell table was not ready. After a 30 minute wait we were seated. This is not unusual, this has happened numerous times to us. As usual food was good but it has gotten to a price point that borders on unjustified. $42 for a steak of a quality you can get at a lot of places in Providence now is disappointing. Also, on nights when they are overbooked (like this time) the noise is quite loud.
January 17, 2014|Superbly prepared steak. Creamy|5|Superbly prepared steak. Creamy and smooth mashed potatoes
January 16, 2014|Birthday Lunch|4|Special occasion and restaurant week too! Mom enjoyed the special touches for her birthday- rose petals on the table, complimentary champagne toast, candle in her cake, great service....I enjoyed the restaurant week special while my mom had a wonderful lobster bisque full of lobster meat and lobster salad roll. Excellent meal!
January 15, 2014|A Spectacular evening|5|This was my first visit to Capital Grille, upon our arrival the hostess was most gracious and professional. The restaurant was extremely busy for a weeknight, however the service we received was excellent, we were treated as if if were the only guest. Our server Nicole Egan was outstanding, she provided us with the highest quality of service, was very knowledgeable about the menu and made ensured our meats were cooked to our specifications. The food was pleasantly presented and the flavor and quality of the meats were superb. Definitely on our list to revisit.
January 15, 2014|Ladies nite out|5|Never been to Capital Grille always heard it was expensive, so when it was on Restaurant week, my neighbor and I said we work hard, we deserve to treat ourselves to a fun night out. The scenry from our seats was entertaining to see all types of people dining. The service (Mark or server) was very nice and offered suggestions, we had a fun night. Made reservations, and when we arrived we did not have to wait at all. I noticed the wait staff was very attentive to their groups/tables.
January 15, 2014|Great service. I'm never disappoint|5|Great service. I'm never disappointed when I go here.
January 14, 2014|Restaurant week|4|Compared to other similar steak house restaurants in the area offering restaurant week, while although very good, this did not stand out from the crowd. I ordered a boneless sirloin, not sure what cut of meat I got, it had a bone, and not the flavor of sirloin. We dine at Capitol Grille at times other than restaurant week, clearly a marked difference in the food quality.
January 14, 2014|Never fails|5|Capital Grille never fails to provide us with a tremendous meal, impeccable service and pleasant atmosphere! We have been going there for over 10 years and have always left happy!
January 14, 2014|Best Capitol Grill around|5|We have been to 3 of the four local branches. The other 2 (Chestnut Hill & Burlington) were crowded, and had noisy, obtrusive bar scenes. This is a big and attractive room; we asked for a quiet table and we were seated far away from the bar: but in any case, it was a calm bar, and people were not shouting or preening. The food was impeccable (beautiful breads, fine meat, terrific salads, perfectly cooked veggies) and the service was calm and assured. It was an occasion for us and we could not have been more pleased.
January 14, 2014|Great Lunch|5|We visited with friends during restaurant week. It was the best deal; the same delicious food and great service at an incredible price.
January 14, 2014|Lunch with work|4|Great Servers! Took care of Gluten and dairy allergies.
January 13, 2014|Restaurant week done well|5|The Capital Grille offers an extraordinary value for this week. The $10 add on option a great idea. Some confusion in which steak was coming from the prix fixe, so I can't say it was one of their best. The staff is so nice, the portions substantial, that overall I rate it a five. The other steak houses in town can't touch the Capitol Grille for their food, friendliness and attention to detail. The creme brûlée is among the best
January 13, 2014|I have never had a bad meal|5|I have never had a bad meal at the Capital Grill. Always have great food and great service. I am never disappointed.
January 12, 2014|High/Low|3|High expectations met at a fabulous restaurant (surprised participating in restaurant week-thank you). Usually for special occasions but decided with friends to treat ourselves on a January night. Everything was 1st class except for the fact that our waiter was sad, depressed, burnt out or all three. Never attempted anything close to a smile. So surprised for this fine establishment...hope he is Ok . Know this line of work very well, hard as it can be have to leave your troubles at home!
January 12, 2014|a lttle disappointed|3|Overall food quality was not as good as it has been on past visits. Service was fine and steak was very good!
Dined on January 12, 2014|Disappointing|3|My husband and I have been celebrating our birthdays there for years. The service has always been impeccable and the food delicious. Given the prices there one would expect no less. This year however the service was adequate. The servers were extremely courteous and friendly but very busy and not at all as attentive as in the past. The food was the most disappointing aspect - ordinary, not outstanding and certainly not worth the price.
January 11, 2014|Great experience!|5|My husband and I visit Providence often (from CT) and it just happened to be restaurant week. We looked at the restaurant options and found The Capital Grille to have the best sounding selection. We made a reservation for 8:45 (1/11/13) and were seated a few minutes early. My husband had the 18oz bone in steak and I had the Chilean sea bass...both of our means were served promptly and the taste was phenomena. Our waiter (Tim, I believe) was fantastic. He recommend a couple of drink options, was very funny and made our dining experience very comfortable and enjoying. I will definitely be coming here again and have already told many of our friends and family about Capital Grille. Keep up the great work!!
January 11, 2014|Excellent dining experience|5|We visited Capital Grille during restaurant week. The choices were nice, and everything was delicious! We love their Kona Crusted Steak! The server was also very accommodating. We enjoyed our dining experience very much, and definitely recommend this restaurant !
January 11, 2014|very good, restaurant week too much|4|"I love the CG. I think it is as special to Providence as Gibson's is to Chicago and Bern's is to Tampa. The food is always excellent and it might be the best overall restaurant in Rhode Island. That being said, this year they seemed a little overwhelmed by restaurant week. Service was impossibly fast, like they had salads ready to go. So the more leisurely paced ""this was made specifically for me"" element was completely absent. One food note is their desserts are not the best. Their options are limited and runny creme brulee, strawberries with a scoop of ice cream and cheesecake with a torched top are the weakest links in the entire place. Don't have your heart set on dessert."
January 11, 2014|Yummy!|3|We went here and thought food was delicious! Our table was cozy and the waiter was nice! We would go again:)
January 11, 2014|Best Service and Personal details|5|Have to say I always enjoy the Capital Grille. This time was no exception. Old School customer service understanding every detail. The waiters always acknowledge the reason or information you provide, if it is a birthday or just friends getting together. This time our waiter was Tim Corcoran and he is the best, friendly, knowledgeable, and knew exactly when to approach table. Great time, great service, great food and great wine. Thank you
January 10, 2014|Dinner Out|4|Everything was good except arrived about 5 minutes before reservation and was told a couple minutes, then had to back after 20 to see if our table was ready and still a few minutes and then they sat us at a table that had been empty since we arrived? Waiter was good and balance of evening good thanks to our great waiter Tom!
January 10, 2014|Always a good experience to|4|Always a good experience to eat at the capital Grille-Providence. The atmosphere is excellent...it feels like Boston, not Providence.Tournedos of beef were good, dry rub steak was overcooked and tough, but edible. Caesar salad was good, but could have had more dressing on it. Mashed potatoes and green beans were excellent. Chocolate cake was most excellent. House wine was very good.
January 9, 2014|The best! From the time we|5|The best! From the time we walk in to when we left, everything was spot on.
January 9, 2014|Restaurant Week Diamond!|5|I decided to visit Capital Grille for a restaurant week taste menu. Capital Grille did not disappoint! My guest and I sampled different items from the list and added on some extras to keep it interesting. I love eating here. Very consistent service and quality from each location across the country.
January 7, 2014|much ado about nothing|3|Chose this place because the guest of honor was a meet and potatoes person. Never ate there before although I live in RI. Food was adequate although not exceptional for the price. There is much better and more interesting cuisine available in RI. The wine list was long and inflated. We ordered a pricey red. The waiter brought a different vintage than was listed. The wine was adequate but insubstantial. The waiter had one other active table. He was inattentive, supercilious, and had an attitude best reserved for a Michelin 4 fork facility in Paris, in spite of the uniform. The rest of the staff was excellent. Good for a business lunch or dinner, otherwise, I would pass.
January 7, 2014|Amazing|4|First time fine dining in providence and Capital Grille did not disappoint. The bone in kona 18 oz steak I got was cooked to perfection and the creme brulee for dessert was exquisite. The dinner also came with green beans and mashed potatoes for their restaurant week special and they were just ok. Overall I really enjoyed the entree; it was tasty but not special enough to deserve 5 stars.
January 4, 2014|expensive but very nice.|4|Me and my girlfriend went, very pleasant experience, would go again on another special occasion just because it is pricey.
January 3, 2014|I love Capital Grille's lounge|5|I love Capital Grille's lounge especially when they have the singer on Friday nights
December 31, 2013|Need ear plugs|5|We love Capital Grille but it is always noisy. However, this time the nose was awful. Could not even hear waiter explain specials. We're in the wine room and never again. Noise and too crowded. Squeezed in to the point of uncomfortable.
December 31, 2013|Don't bother going on a major|3|Don't bother going on a major holiday . Had reservations for new years eve for a party of 4, when we arrived we still had to wait 20 minutes. It was so jam packed that the only table available was in a booth stuffed in a corner. The service as always was outstanding but the food has in my opinion gone down hill. I ordered a rare steak that came out almost an hour later medium well and I wasn't going to send it back cause I didn't want to wait anymore. Sorry capital grille after all the years of coming, doesn't look like I'm going to be running back anytime soon.
December 31, 2013|Considering it was New Year's|3|Considering it was New Year's Eve, the experience was good. There was something wrong with the tomatoes on one of our salads (funny color and bad taste) and one of our steaks was a bit charred on the outside. The cocktails were not as good as usual. Overall the quality of the food was good and the service was good (you felt a little rushed - we had 7:30 PM reservations and you could tell they were pushing for the next seating). Not our best visit to Capital Grille, but still our favorite restaurant for special occasions!
December 31, 2013|Fantastic Food and Service!|5|We had an early New Year's Eve dinner here and were pleasantly surprised that we could choose from the regular menu and not a limited holiday one. The food and service were superb! We were also out in plenty of time to get to the theater without being rushed. For us, it is a wonderful special occasion restaurant, as it is a bit pricey, but the well-prepared food and attentive service make it all worthwhile.
December 28, 2013|Always excellent|5|Don't laugh...ok, go ahead and laugh...my husband and I are vegetarian yet we love the Capital Grille. The service is outstanding and the total dining experience is always great. Veggies- they will specially prepare something divine for you. I've always found that steak places make THE BEST grilled vegetable platters and interesting pasta dishes. Go....mangia...have a great time.
December 28, 2013|From start to finish ... AMAZING!|5|Being in the industry myself, I was coming with a list of full expectations. The second I walked in those expectations were met and then some. I was blown away by how they switched the napkin so no lint would get on my clothes. The food, wine, service, ambience, etc were out of this world and cooked to perfection. It was a crowded night and I was worried our food might be under or over cooked seeing as how many dishes the chefs had to make. That says a lot. Ken is a fantastic waiter who I highly recommend with such expertise, knowledge, and great personality. Will definitely be coming back and suggesting to friends.
December 24, 2013|A Perfect Holiday Experience!|5|We had a fabulous Christmas Eve day lunch. We were greeted with a smile and seated immediately for our reservation. Our waiter was prompt, friendly and witty! He allowed us time to settle in and have a cocktail before ordering. Our appetizers arrived in a well paced time frame. The Wedge Salad was the best I've ever had. The plate and lettuce were stone cold; the blue cheese dressing amazingly fresh and delicious. My husband had the award winning Clam Chowder and loved every bit. My hard to please mother in law thoroughly enjoyed her field green salad with house dressing! Our lunch entrees were served and were perfectly prepared. Dessert was without exception. Our waiter was exceptionally gracious and was there to warmly say good bye.
December 21, 2013|consistantly excellent|5|We have never had a bad meal there nor ever had bad service> The food is delicious and the service is outstanding.. Sat at bar first and the bartender made us drinks that we liked perfectly and with a smile. We also had the best waiter that a restaurant could have, Knowlton Walsh. We always ask for him because he is very charming, friendly,honest and a delight to spend the evening with. Love him. We once had a special party for about 20 people and he was our waiter and he was outstanding. We feel this is the best Capital grill
December 21, 2013|Great food, great service|4|We thoroughly enjoyed the food and service. There was a wine by the glass (Freemark Abbey) that we were looking forward to having and wasn't carried. Other than that and more than a normal sound of breaking plates and glasses, it was a great night, of dining.
December 21, 2013|If you want steak...|5|There's no better place! In Providence, there's no more expensive restaurant, but for the special occasion it's always been hard to beat the CG. Perfectly prepared steaks, great bar, and unbeatable service. So for the right event, or special night out, swallow the price tag and go!
December 21, 2013|We love Capital Grille - Providence|5|My husband and I had another wonderful meal at Capital Grille this weekend for my birthday. We are both happy carnivores, but I will only order steak if I think it's going to be at least as excellent as the ones we grill at home. Capital Grille is pricey, but it is so high quality that it's worth it and we love if for our special occasions (which come more frequently than you'd think :o)) Please note: the steaks are outstanding, but what I'm really dreaming about are the potatoes au gratin.
December 13, 2013|Sit with Aaron at the bar|5|All the bartenders here are wonderful. We work at another restaurant in the area and always sit at the bar. Aaron is wonderful knows everyone at his bar and always has a good crowd. Food was great.
December 12, 2013|Great Holiday Lunch|4|Had a great lunch with friends near Christmas. Food couldn't be better. Lunch Menu was excellent.
December 10, 2013|Happy Anniversary|5|We went to the CapitalGrill to celebrate our 25th anniversary. The staff was excellent,. We were shown to a table by the windows that had rose pedals scattered on it(nice touch!). We were each given a complimentary glass of champagne and the chef sent out a sample appetizer. Our server Ken was excellent, very attentive to us and had great suggestions for the entrees. The food was fabulous and the meal was finished with a complimentary dessert platter sent out by the chef. We had a wonderful evening and would definitely recommend the Capital Grill to anyone looking for a place to spend a special night out.
December 6, 2013|Not as good as last time.|3|We went here a few months ago and decided to go back for a birthday celebration. Tried to order a bottle of wine from the wine list and the 7 we tried to order were unavailable. Time to update the wine menu. Two people at the table ordered the exact same meal but they came over cooked totally different and inconsistently. My steak had to go back because it was overcooked. My company was almost done with their entree before I got my new steak. I really expect much more from a restaurant of this caliber. I can spend this much money at a different restaurant and get a much better meal/experience. Sadly, this is most likely our last visit to Capital Grille Providence.
December 2, 2013|Always excellent|5|We love to go to the Capital Grille for special occasions. Well, would love to go anytime, but special occasions are the only time we can afford it! Although pricey, it is appropriate pricey for all that the do and serve. Love this place!!!!
November 29, 2013|Consistently good|4|Overall very good, the kitchen was slow, restaurant wasnt busy apps took too long, the food was very good, server Megan was outstanding..... The fan was blowing cold air on our backs, it got better but was cold and hard to control, Manager was attentive Excellent job at recognizing and celebrating the birthday we had Thanks Russell
November 29, 2013|Black Friday Lunch|4|Took my 42 year old daughter here for lunch after shopping at Providence Place Mall. This is the third year in a row that we have eaten at Capital Grille on Black Friday. After walking the mall for three hours it is a pleasure to sit down to a quiet lunch. I had the Lobster Bisque (a special) and it did not disappoint, in the cup there were three pieces of claw meat, this is the best bisque I have ever eaten and I should know because I order it whenever I see it on the menu. For entrees my daughter had the cheeseburger w/truffle fries and I had the Lobster Salad, both were quite good, unfortunately there was no room for dessert so we finished our meal with coffee. Hopefully will return next year for our annual tradition.
November 28, 2013|A Festive Thansgiving Dinner|5|We were unable to do our Traditional Thanksgiving at home. Capital Grille was warm, welcoming and festive. The entire staff had a Holiday spirit. The food and service were impeccable. Calamari for the table, lobster and Crab Cakes, Filet, Delmonico Steaks , chopped salad, roasted mushrooms and creamed spinach were all delicious. We were seated immediately and enjoyed the ambiance and the food for 2 1/2 hours. No rush, just excellent service great food and a festive Holiday atmosphere. A+ for Capital Grille.
November 23, 2013|GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE . WAS|5|GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE . WAS THERE FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED
November 23, 2013|Bob's Birthday|5|Welcoming atmosphere, superior customer services (hostess, coat room, wait staff), and extraordinary food. Our waitress (Meaghan Lombard - ask for her) provided excellent beverage and food recommendations, customized plating by combining a beef and fish dish for us, and was perfectly attentive. We were dining in recognition of my brother in law's birthday and the recognition provided was age appropriate.
November 22, 2013|Anniversary treat|5|I took my wife here as a special treat for our wedding anniversary. Upon being seated by the hostess, you immediately noticed the rose petals scattered discretely on our table - nice touch. We each had a drink to start, shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and a Cesar salad. Filet mignon were our entrees of choice - done just the way we each like our steaks. Family style veggies rounded out our meal. The waiter, Daniel, was helpful throughout the meal. We both enjoyed our little romantic celebration. We'll certainly return for another special occasion!
November 15, 2013|Touch of detail|5|Reservations were made on-line for a special occasion and the staff greeted us and paid special attention to the detail of the requested reservation. The subtle little details made the night that much more special. It was greatly appreciated.
November 9, 2013|Enjoyable dinner|5|My husband and I enjoyed this restaurant. Very classy inside but you do not need to dress up. The hostess and waiters were all very friendly. The menu is ala carte, side orders are large enough for two. Our dinners, sirloin steak and the lobster mac and cheese were delicious. Make sure you save room for dessert! Would definitely revisit again, glad we listened to the previous reviews.
November 8, 2013|Hostess was awesome!|4|Food and service was wonderful and the hostess went above and beyond!
November 2, 2013|disappointing|3|Very loud in restaurant..... asked for a quiet, out of the way table. Bottle of wine was a.different year than told by server. Did not pair well with beef. Potatoes and vegetables overcooked. Very disappointed. Very expensive for what we experienced.
Dined on November 2, 2013|perfect night|4|THE SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING. FRIENDLY STAFF. TABLE WAS BEAUTFUL. FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. I WOULD RECOMMEND A NIGHT THERE
October 31, 2013|A Little Disappointing|3|My wife and I were there for a non-business lunch as a special treat to ourselves. Although the service and atmosphere were great, the food itself was a little disappointing. The lobster salad (good quantity) was a little salty tasting, and the burger, while excellent, certainly fell somewhat short of the advertised 9 ounces.
October 31, 2013|We took advantage of the $50|4|We took advantage of the $50 deal Am Express offered its card holders & still had to spend extra even just for lunch. It is very pricey otherwise; great for expense account meal. We'd go again with a bus. account, gift certificate, coupon or discount.... Tobias our waiter was excellent.
October 30, 2013|Great experience for my first time!|5|"I had never had the ""privilege"" of dining at Capital Grille before but I had heard wonderful things about this restaurant. It lived up to its name. We got seated right away. The waiter was polite and knowledgeable and came to check up on us enough but not too many times. Our drinks were never empty for long. The food was well prepared and very delicious. The warm rolls delivered to our table shortly after we arrived were a very nice touch also."
October 28, 2013|Outstanding!|5|Capital Grill is always a great dining experience.
October 27, 2013|This restaurant was outstanding.|5|This restaurant was outstanding. I made my reservation on line and mentioned it was my daughter's 14th birthday. Our table was festively decorated and they had even placed a birthday card on the table! I was pleasantly surprised. They waiter was wonderful as was the food! My children ages 14, 11, and 7 were treated very well. I can't say enough about the evening! Thank You
October 24, 2013|Best steak ever at the Capital Gril|5|The Kona steak is unbelievable. Pricey though. Would be nice if the entrees included vegetables.
October 19, 2013|Thank you!|5|Our group went there Saturday night for a bachelorette party. It was amazing! Staff was exceptional and the food was exquisite. Started with a champagne toast and ended with a complimentary dessert for the bride to be. We couldn't have asked for a better start to the evening.
October 12, 2013|Worth the Wait|4|On another trip to Providence's Capital Grille, the outstanding food and wait staff make up for waiting a full half hour after our Open Table reservation time to be seated. Soups, steaks, and sides were all brilliantly prepared. The cocktails and wine list matched the food. CapGrill just can't avoid over booking on a busy Waterfire Saturday night.
October 12, 2013|Once again, a great experience|5|Food as always was awesome. I had the corn with bacon side dish, wow. Get this side. Service as always was excellent. I reserved on open table and got the same table as last time. The view is good but the HVAC system blows on you. My wife had to put a coat on, and the food gets cold quick.
October 11, 2013|The food was great. The waiter|4|The food was great. The waiter was attentive but had too many tables and other waiters were standing around. The service definately suffered because of this. We actually left with the check with the tip in it, on the table without seeing the waiter again, not happy about that. The resturant was a bit louder than expected but not terrible. Overall a good experience, we would probably go back.
October 10, 2013|Anniversary Celebration|5|"We had a very nice evening, and were very well served, including a special ""Happy Anniversary"" dessert plate. Although it was very expensive, it was memorable and the food was excellent."
October 7, 2013|The customer service, from|5|The customer service, from Kadisha at the front desk to Nicki, our server was exceptional...very client focused! The food was great and it was a wonderful evening.
October 5, 2013|Anniversary dinner|5|"A good friend of mine gave me a gift card to the Capital Grill, so I decided to use it for our 17th wedding anniversary. We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived. There were rose petals on the table and we were given a complimentary champagne toast. Our server was wonderful. He recommended the lobster bisque, which was divine. Our meals were absolutely fantastic, cooked to perfection. We were given a complimentary dessert of chocolate cake and cheesecake on a plate that had ""Happy Anniversary"" stenciled in chocolate. It was amazing. Then to my surprise, we were given champagne flutes as a gift for our anniversary. It was the beat experience we have ever had at a restaurant. I highly recommend them!"
October 4, 2013|Outstanding French Onion soup|5|Outstanding French Onion soup and the burger special with wine was also wonderful. Singer Tony Cerbo made the experience even more phenomenal!
October 4, 2013|excellent dining experience|5|Everything was wonderful. The ambiance, the food, the wine all top notch but what really made the night was our server Tim. He made us feel at home and was engaged in our dining experience in a way seldom found when you dine out.
October 2, 2013|One of the few lunch spots|3|There are not many nice places for lunch in Provide cue so I was glad to locate a lunch spot. Everything was just okay. Salads were overdressed and everyone needed extra salt. Not bad but not great either, especially for the price.
September 29, 2013|Excellent!|5|Found this almost by accident after running the Rock and Roll half marathon and wanted a place to celebrate and finally have some wine! Beautiful interior, food was to die for and service (ala waiter Knorton - hope I spelled his name right!) was superb! A must if visiting Providence for an upscale dining experience.
September 28, 2013|OUTSTANDING !|5|We went here for our wedding anniversary and our server made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant! The service was second to none, the food was perfectly delicious, and the ambiance was just right. I couldn't have asked for a better evening.
September 24, 2013|Great time at the Grille|5|We had a diverse group from out of town and large at that. The service and selection are second to none.
September 21, 2013|The best Capital Grille|5|From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave it is dining at its finest. Courteous and knowledgable staff whom when asked a question had the correct answers instantly. The good is second to none and look forward to visiting again!
September 20, 2013|Good and dependable steak place|4|Good steak place but I like there Connecticut location better
September 20, 2013|Another outstanding dinner|5|Another outstanding dinner experience! Our favorite restaurant -great food,service and ambiance .
September 20, 2013|Always excellent|5|Service and food are always top notch at Caputal Grille. You can't go wrong here!
September 18, 2013|Sat at the bar|5|We always sit at the bar. Had wonderful service by Kerry I believe the blonde bartenders name was. Aaron is also wonderful and gives you great service. The manager on duty was also very Nice.
September 8, 2013|Steak Dinner|3|The service team worked with well timed bus service, food delivery, table visits to refresh the beverages and in a friendly professional manner. The steak was a delicious flavor but my ordered rare steak was refrigerator cold through most of the cut, not cool or warm. The table share dishes were portioned, prepared, and presented perfectly.
September 7, 2013|Filet mignon melt-in-your-mouth|4|Filet mignon melt-in-your-mouth tender. Unfortunately same could not be said of lamb chops, but still good served with mint jelly.
September 1, 2013|Ask for a table near a waiter|3|The service up until our entrees were delivered was excellent. It declined substantially after that.
August 28, 2013|Server attitude|3|Food is always good and I like the roominess of the Providence location. The server had a miserable attitude, like it was a favor for us to be there for him.
August 27, 2013|It was our 30th wedding anniversary|5|It was our 30th wedding anniversary and the whole staff from the hostess to the Managers went over and above to make sure everything was perfect. The food, service and atmosphere was 5 star perfection.
August 26, 2013|special meal for a special occasion|4|"Took my husband there for his birthday and had a lovely meal.the steaks were cooked to perfection, the sides were amazing, and pacing of the meal was excellent too. The waiter was not eligible without being intrusive. We took advantage of the ""generous pours"", a California wine tasting. We were too full to try any desserts, but the ones going past our table looked delicious. Additional bonus was having complimentary parking in the garage. All together a delightful experience."
August 24, 2013|Consistently good.|4|I dined in this restaurant 2 weekends in a row and both times the service was excellent. My delmonico steak au poive was exceptional and cooked medium rare as I requested. The 15-year balsamic vinegar on the mozzarell and tomato appetizer was superb and the basil very fresh. My mother's filet mignon was not petite, but perfectly portioned and also cooked to her liking. The au gratin potatoes were fantasticly cheesy and the crumbs of onions on top were crusted to perfection. The best part of the meal was the dessert. I highly recommend the flourless chocolate cake. It melts in your mouth and gave me a head rush with every bite. My cappuccino was also perfect. Rose petals on the table also make for a perfect special occassion.
August 23, 2013|Great evening!|5|Went to dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday and had a great night. Our server Ronnie was great! He treated us to dessert and a champagne toast. Very classy! Everthing about the night was perfect.
August 21, 2013|Amazing|5|My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. They took note of the occasion and made our experience there unforgettable!! The food was delectable and our waiter was beyond perfection!
August 16, 2013|Spinach side was rather tasteless.|3|Spinach side was rather tasteless. Mushroom side was good. Your menu needs more options for vegetarians. A wiider array of salads would be wonderful. Prices are too high for the average person. Prices should include sides at the very least. If it weren't for the singer Tony Cerbo being there, it would have been a very disappointing evening.
August 12, 2013|ZZzZZZZzZzZZzZzZ !!!|4|Great food, but fell short on service this time. Nothing is more painful then waiting 15 min. To get your check, with a waiter about as animated as a plate.
August 10, 2013|Did not dissapoint|5|We've been to the Capital Grille in Boston several times but thought this time we would try the original location. We were not dissppointed. The restaurant is beautiful (hope the upcoming renovation doesn't remove the charm) , everything we ate was delicious, and the wait staff was very attentive. We would definitely recommend this restaurant and do plan on going back.
August 10, 2013|concerns|3|"While the server was appropriate we went in without a reservation at first and asked for a table. We were told there were none. I stoodin front of tthe hostess and signed in to open table saw a table immediately available and said we have a reservation that I just. Made on open table at which point she said ""oh"" and sat us. A little suscpicious I think....we're black"
August 6, 2013|Amazing!!|5|We were celebrating a birthday and wanted a special restaurant, so we chose Capital Grille on the recommendatin from a friend. It did not disappoint. This was our first trip to Capital Grille and from the moment we walked in we were treated as though we had been regulars for years. We began with a wonderful prosciutto-mozzarella appetizer that melted in our mouths, as well as lobster bisque filled with large chunks of lobster, and crisp salads with a wonderful tasting vinaigrette. For entrees, we had steak & lobster, lamb chops, and sea bass. The steaks were cooked to perfection with huge lobster meat on top, the lamb was perfect, and the sea bass melted in our mouths. Dessert was delectable! The service was superb!!
August 2, 2013|Awesome|5|This a gem. Food is excellent. The waiter, Tom, is amazing.
Dined on July 30, 2013|great food and service|5|Great atmosphere, food, and service. You can't ask for anything more in a dining experience.
July 30, 2013|Always Outstanding!|5|What can you say...it's the Capital Grille! Of course you'll go broke dining there every night, but when you can muster up the cash for a special night out or occasion, it's the place you go. Everything is always impeccably done...
July 27, 2013|Fantastic food & service|5|We had a family celebration at Capital Grille, a longtime favorite restaurant of mine. The food and service never fail to disappoint. The staff was warm and helpful (age range of party was 13 - 78) and the many questions a requests that occurred were handles pleasantly and promptly.
July 26, 2013|It was our wedding anniversary.|5|It was our wedding anniversary. Tom, as well as other staff made us feel like the only patrons in the place...Have never had a bad meal here....whether you are carnivore or sea lover, the dishes are not only prepared well but the presentations are always on the mark. one of our all time favorite Providence spots...
July 20, 2013|food and service|3|the food was excellent, the bar area if you are waiting for a drink is very cramped. The seating is a little crowded in the dinning area but overall it is a great place for dinnier. The noise level is a lttle loud, but the surroundings are lovely. The hostest was very kind and pleasant. She sat us promptley for our reservations, the waiter did take his time although there we're a lot of large parties in the resraurant on a saturday night. The parking area is good and the scenic view is nice. You can walk around outside afterward around the riverside. I would recommend this to others.
July 20, 2013|Saturday nite treat!|5|Captital Grille never dissapoints..we love to go there for Restaurant week..the staff is soo courteous and attentive, tho my husband really needed one of those black napkins!..The summer wine special is a great idea..and fabulous deal. Always recommend for great food and best Cosmo in town!
July 20, 2013|Wonderful Evening|5|My husband, daughter, and I recently spent a memorable dining experience at Capital Grille. We were celebrating our Anniversary and our daughter's birthday. Every effot was put into making it a special evening. The food, waiter, and entire staff were excellent. We are looking forward to returning there soon.
July 20, 2013|Doesn't love up to its hype|4|As one of the most highly regarded restaurants, it simply didn't live up to expectations. The steak was very good but besides that, everything was just above average. Also, I found it to be quite noisy and the waiter to be snooby. If the price was a little cheaper I would be saying much better things, but for the price I don't think it was worth it. I found Flemings to be a lot better.
July 19, 2013|Great food and service. I|5|Great food and service. I would recommend this place for a special occasion.
July 19, 2013|restaurant week|5|My date and I went here for restaurant week. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. This is a pricey restaurant but worth it for special occasions or fancy nights out.
July 19, 2013|Steaks not as good as before....|3|Five of us went for Restaurant week, we usually do that every year....This year, the entire group agreed that Filet and the Sirloin were not as good as previous times. All of our steaks were overcooked.. Most of us asked for Medium Rare and they either came Medium or Medium Well. The flavor of the meat was also not as par as other SteakHouses in the PVD area that we are now favoring over the Capital Grille.
July 19, 2013|Excellent...As always|5|Great experience once again at the Capitol Grill. Excellent wait staff took care of all our needs. We were there for our anniversary and they had rose petals sprinkled on the table. A nice surprise and just shows that the extra effort makes a world of difference.
July 19, 2013|Definately worth the money.|5|The food is moderately expensive. It isn't a restaurant I would be able to attend frequently, but it's perfect for a special occasion or night out. The food and service were exceptional. I am very picky but the overall experience was worth the money and made for a memorable evening with my family.
July 18, 2013|love this place|5|This was my first time and it was amazing. Would recommend to all my friends and damily
July 18, 2013|Great food and service|4|Great food and wonderful service but a bit pricy. Air conditioning was terrible and dining room was hot. Otherwise a great time as always.
July 18, 2013|restaurant week|5|Went for restaurant week & enjoyed the meal. The menu was sufficient to choose from. I have to dine gluten free & server was very receptive helping me to find food that I could eat. The atmosphere & meal were great. Would go there again.
July 18, 2013|Visit during restaurant week|4|Have been a number of times to this Capital Grille and others in Massachusetts. Over the years they have been consistently good. This visit was less notable. Service was not up to par and one meal was over cooked. It will not deter us from going back.
July 16, 2013|Dinner over seas!|5|Our dinner guests were from Lebanon. The enjoyed being here and loved the restaurant.We took pictures and they sent them to the rest of their family in Lebanon. The service was amazing and our s erver made our guests feel at home. We were ther on Tuesday the 16th for restaurant werk and we were a partu of ten as you enter the dining room. Thank you karen Greene
July 16, 2013|Excellent Salmon|5|The restaurant week lunch was excellent. We had the salmon andi it was very tasty. Martinis were very well made and bar service was excelelnt.
July 15, 2013|Went there for a birthday.|5|Went there for a birthday. Everything was amazing... food, service, all of it. Perfect dinner
July 13, 2013|GREAT FOOD BUT LACKED GOOD SERVICE|4|GREAT FOOD BUT DID LACK GOOD SERVICE. WAITER WAS NOT ATTENDANT HAD TO ASK FOR EVERYTHING. OTHERWISE VERY VERY GOOD
July 13, 2013|Waiter!|4|"The Capital Grille is generally excellent, even during Restaurant Week or during the Providence River Fire Show. However, on occasion you can get a so-so waiter. This time around ours was only around a few times, didn't place the steak knives or provide drink refills, I had to ask for these separately. The side dishes for the main course were not as ""heaping"" as they would normally be. Overall, TCG is generally excellent, but sometimes a waiter who's either tired or too busy can make the dining experience sub-par."
July 13, 2013|Rushed through...|2|We've been to the Grille for restaurant week numerous times now, but never have we been so rushed or had such poor service. Very disappointing...
July 13, 2013|Tops in food and service!|5|Our party of four enjoyed delicious food from appetizer to dessert. The filets were cooked to perfection and the desserts!!! AHH!!
July 12, 2013|Never had a bad meal|5|Capital Grill is consistently good, never had a bad meal! This week they participated in Providence Restaurant Week and the value for the 3 course meal was just$29.95. What a deal!!! Food and drinks were fabulous. The restaurant was hopping and it made for a great evening. Kudos to Kyle our server. He made the night fun.
July 12, 2013|Waiter made it all better|4|Not so pleased with the front desk staff as they made us wait 30 minutes although we had reservations... and they seated others as they came in. The booth that they put us in was open and clean from the time we arrived but we still had to wait for it. The waiter came along and made it all good. He was a professional and made our dinner worth the wait and inconvenience. The food was all cooked perfectly and came out when it should have. We never felt rushed and the waiter was very accommodating to our requests. If it wasn't for the front desk staff, it would have been a perfect evening.
July 12, 2013|Excellent Service|5|"My family and I attended the Capital Grille for Restaurant week this past Friday night. Our reservation was at 5:30 but we hit some traffic on the way, so as a courtesy to the restaurant I phoned in to let them know we might be a few minutes behind. The hostess that answered the phone was very abrupt in saying that ""It would HAVE to be OKAY!"" that we were running late. We addressed it too the manager and he comped a round of our drinks which he didn't have to do, but it was appreciated. Other than that our waiter Erich was phenomenal. he was very attentative and gave great reccomendations. We will definitely be back!"
July 12, 2013|The Cap|5|We joke and call it the Cap to the kids. This time we took the boys for a special treat. Everything was great. Waitress was great with our boys, 8 and 12 yo, and as always food was fabulous.
July 11, 2013|Disappointed|3|The Capital Grille is a very nice upscale restaurant, however, I was not impressed with the food. We have been here several times including restaurant week and have usually enjoyed our meal. There were three people in our party and we were not impressed during this most recent visit. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. I could have had this same meal at another restaurant for a lot less and probably would have had a better flavor. We had the filet mignon and there were no seasonings or spices to provide extra flavor. It was like a chunk of meat sitting on the plate. My husband paid an additional $10 and received 3 shrimp. He stated there was no flavor or seasoning. It was just okay. I expected better.
July 11, 2013|Lunch at Capital Grille|5|I totally enjoyed lunch at Capital Grille and other members of my party shared the same experience. The salmon was excellent and the flourless chocolate cake was to die for. The service was excellent - very attentive and asked upfront if anyone in the party had a time constraint. Capital Grille is definitely on my return list.
July 10, 2013|Excellent Dining Experience|5|Great food, great service! Another excellent experience.
July 9, 2013|Fabulous food and service.|5|Fabulous food and service. Always consistent. I like sitting at the bar where bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable, professional and courteous.
July 9, 2013|Outstanding Food & Service|5|"Usually, I visit the establishment for special occasions. This week the restaurant par took in the community's ""restaurant week"". This afforded me the opportunity to take my family out as a treat. We still received the top notch service as you would expect, and indulged in quite a tasty menu."
July 8, 2013|Great experience|5|While on a college tour through RI, we dined at the Capital Grille. Daniel was our waiter and was clearly one of the best. He spent a few minutes explaining the different cuts of meat and how to best prepare each one. Our daughter commented how nice he was and how that helped he choose her meal. The quality was excellent.
July 7, 2013|Restaurant Week Review|3|This year they have offered the basic $29.00 and an upcharged menu for $10 more. In the past the best deal was the sirloin steak with with a kona coffee crust, but this year the steak is plain. In order to get the kona crust one has to go to the more expensive menu or ask for the crusted steak for $3 more. The plain steak was bland i told the server that they should not have done this and he said that he told management to make sure to offer the $3 upcharged steak when customers come in.
July 6, 2013|Excellent venue and meal|5|Fabulous food in a vibrant setting. Evening was a thankyou to special friends who had accommodated my wife and I during our vacation. They had never been to a Capitol Grille but following the meal they could not stop enthusing about it. Job done. Waiters were so very attentive and chatty which we liked.
July 3, 2013|Exceptional|5|Superb food and service. Always a great steak lover's restaurant. Had the NY Strip and it was cooked to perfection.
July 3, 2013|super mid-trip lunch|4|"Have always enjoyed Capital Grille, but now they have what they call ""Plates"" at lunch: 3 courses for $18, a steal of a deal. Each course was great. I even wrote down all the ingredients in the Watermelon Tomato and Feta salad and made it for my vacation hosts two days later to much acclaim."
June 29, 2013|Superior!!|5|The food was delectable for every course! Service impeccable. Only slight drawback was the noise level. Hard to hear my guest across the 2 top!
June 29, 2013|Wonderful dinner. Special|5|Wonderful dinner. Special birthday for our guest and she was treated like a special guest. Good specials and regular menu as well offers great choices. Liked selection of 1/2 bottles of wine.
Dined on June 29, 2013|Phenomenal|5|Food and experience was phenomenal. I mentioned it was our anniversary when making reservations. They sprinkled rose petals on our table. Five star service! Desert was on the house. They also gave us complimentary champagne and toasting glasses to mark the occasion. Food was mouth watering good!

June 15, 2013|Awesome with a Capital A|5|Sons 13th birthday was special. Every staff member said happy birthday and they brought him cake. Food always incredible. Too pricey for me to be anything but a special occasion dinner. Well worth it though.
June 14, 2013|Amazing meal|5|From the fresh warm bread selection, the room temperature salted butter to the steak and the sides this was an outstanding meal.
June 8, 2013|Great food and service|4|Great food and Service. They really cater to people with food allergies too.

June 7, 2013|Best 5-star restaurant - Providence|5|Great Food and Great Service. Expensive but worth a treat once in a while. Best 5-star restaurant in Providence.
May 31, 2013|Great for special occasions|4|We went here to celebrate my daughter's college graduation. Two of us got clam chowder as an appetizer, which was fine but nothing really special. We also got the calamari which was good. Most of us ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon, which was super. What wasn't so super was that for $42, all you got was the meat. All sides were extra. I'd think for that price you wouldn't have to pay extra for vegetables or potatoes. Still, a great meal. The wine steward was very helpful. All in all I'd certainly go back again.
May 31, 2013|Great evening|5|Wonderful meal, Joshua was a fabulous waiter-knowledgeable, helpful, pleasant. We had a lovely birthday celebration for my husband with birthday greetings from everyone. Sometimes expensive restaurants are just that, expensive. This restaurant was worth every penny.

Bobby (the GM) came over and introduced himself and made sure we had everything we needed and that our food was nothing but perfect. We love Paul behind the bar so went and had a few after dinner drinks and some laughs with him. Thanks capital grille for another amazing meal!!! Wish you were closer to home in CT!!!
May 26, 2013|My Dining Experience !!!|5|Excellent and superb service received at the Capital Grille resturant location in Providence Rhode Island which is the main top first location to be opened nationwide USA. The food quality was excellent, the chef did an outstanding job with the food preparation and presentation, and most of all the staff was most outstanding, friendly, and caring to ensure our dining experience was to the utmost. Highly reccommended resturant and is a must to visit in the Rhode Island area. Definetely would visit that resturant again because of the top outstanding service received and of the best food quality service which was truly enjoyable.
May 25, 2013|Not up to Capital Grille Norm|3|We celebrated our daughter's college graduation dinner at Capital Grille Providence. I chose this because of the consistency of quality of all the Capital Grilles we dine at in Florida. Well service andf vibe were great as usual and al the appertizers were great. BUT the biggest disappointment was the filet mignon which was such a shame becasue 5 people ordered it...It is also ironic since GC is primarily a 'steak house'..I know it was a busy weekend, but it was if they ran out of their filet and ran to a local market to get some ordinary steaks...they looked flat and skimoy upon arrival and more disappointing was the waiter kerfuffled for an explanation....just truly disaapointed ..
May 21, 2013|Excellent Food, Excellent Service|5|Always professional, always on time with the seating. The food was outstanding, shrimp cocktail and lobster and crab cakes to start. The lobster and crab cakes are among the best I've ever tasted. Steak and lobster entree. Everything cooked to perfection. Attentive service, never felt rushed. It was our anniversary, and the restaurant added their own touchs with no special requests from us. This included rose petals on the table and complimentary dessert. Another outstanding culinary dining experience from the Capital Grille. Truly, you cant go wrong with these folks.
May 17, 2013|Graduation Night|5|...made quite special by our good waiter, Josh...food and ambiance was perfect - making a lovely, memorable evening for my daughter's graduation.

April 19, 2013|20th Wedding anniversay at the Capi|5|We went there for our 20th Wedding anniversary, the waiter Tobias asked us if we were celebrating an occasion and we told him, well all of a sudden we had complimentary champange and rose petals on the table. Then the chef sent out a special appetizer. The meal could not of been better. The steaks were perfect and all the sides were wonderful. At the end of the dinner the manager came over and congratulated us and talked to us for a bit. I would highly reccomend the Capital Grill and expect to be back soon!
April 10, 2013|Convenient!|5|Great for a quick lunch in downtown Providence. Great service, complimentary champagne for my birthday and food that's always on par with all the Capital Grille locations.
April 6, 2013|Good but Overpriced|3|First-time at any Capital Grille. The food was good but very expensive. 1 round of drinks, a la cart dining, 2 shared desserts for a table of 4 (including tax and 20% tip) was ~$440.00. We can get same food quality & same level of service at other restaurants for 1/2 the price. Won't be going back.

My daughter ordered the special Sirloin and it was kind of Dry. The side dish's were very good. The Crab/Lobster cakes were the highlight of the dinner. The sevice was very slow. It could be because it was easter. We had planned on ordering desert but the waiter did not come around for 20 minutes after giving us the menu.

Our waiter could not have been as attentive without them. HN
March 23, 2013|I have not been to Capitol|5|I have not been to Capitol Grill in a few years but not for any reason. I took my wife for dinner and the service was excellent to start. I had a wonderful tabpe which made me notice the whold view of the dining room. Each guest was treated as if their own family was waiting on them, lots of energy, questions being fired and answers being spot on in return. I had a Sirloin my wife had the 22 oz. Rib which she polished off and said it was the best restaurant steak she has ever had. Matt the chef came by to chat and we sampled their Lobster Mac and Cheese which they use Mascapone Cheese and the suttle richiness didnt over bear the lobster. All in all it was a nice expierence and cant wait to stop in again. My thanks to Matt and the Management

February 14, 2013|First Bad Meal at Capital Grille|2|I made the reservation more than 2 weeks in advance of Valentines Day hoping to get a nice table. We ended up at a table right inside the doorway on a cold night so had to keep coat on because every time the door opened a cold wind blew in. My filet mignon ordered medium was WELL done but the waiter never came back after the food servers brought the food to ask how it was so I ate some and wasted the remainder. I have eaten at Capital Grille many times (providence, vegas, boston, tampa - I always look for one when traveling) and this is the first bad experience I have had. But, given It cost well over $200 I will not risk it again :(

Nicole our server was amazing! She was attentive and personable, and when we dine at this location again I will most certainly ask for her. The food was prepared very well, and I would recommend the Lobster Bisque. Save room for dessert, home made ice cream over fresh berries and coconut cream pie should not be missed.
February 13, 2013|Not the top steakhouse in neighborh|3|First time at capital grille and it was a little of a disappointment. Food tasted good but definitely lacked. Calamari was good but just good, lobster bisque was thick, pudding like, not how it's suppose to be, steak was smothered in butter, suppose to be a shallot butter but definitely over did it. My girlfriend got chicken confit and that was very good. I've been to steakhouses from Vegas, to Boston, and Foxwoods. This did not hold a candle to any of them.

The food was very good, but that was to be expected. It did not ""wow"" us but it definitely did not disappoint. We had the lobster and crab stuffed shrimp (very good), the corn with bacon which was an interesting and enjoyable blend of flavors but I would not personally order it again, the creamed spinach, and for dessert the chocolate hazelnut cake. The cake was a bit disappointing, it was not very rich in flavor but was presented beautifully."

The only issue with I had and didn't notice until I had left the restaurant, I had ordered a Wedge Salad with my steak. The salad never came but I was charged $11.00 for the salad. This would not stop me from going back to the Capital Grille.

Thank you to your whole staff for a great evening with excellent service and food. We also appreciate how you do the parking - must have a reservation so we are able to get a spot and it is free!
January 26, 2013|We love the Capital Grille|3|We love the Capital Grille and go to the Providence location on a regular basis. The service is always excellent! I think on this visit, the food was not up to par due to it being Restaurant week. My salad was wilted and warm and the creme brulee was runny and not cold enough. I will go back but, not during restaurant week.
January 26, 2013|Great night out...|5|"Always a great night out. Was skeptical at first as they took a while to get us to our table despite the reservation (but in fairness, I had called and modified it by 1 person that afternoon). Still, party of 4 seated at the largest corner table I've ever seen, amazing wait staff (thanks Cy) and always exactly what you want, exactly how you wanted it. For the ""chain"" steakhouses in the area, it's the best."
January 26, 2013|Being Restaurant Week, it|3|Being Restaurant Week, it was very busy. We did get seated promptly as per our reservations and had a nice table, away from the traffic throughout the restaurant. Waiter and service crew were pleasant, but rushed. No special effort was made to see if everything was okay. Extra lobster tails we ordered came late, teaspoon had to be send back, and coffee was not refilled as requested. Food was good, steak was great and lobster as well. But we felt rushed, not how we would have liked it on a Saturday night. Out within 1 hour. We felt it was not a night that they tried to impress us in hopes that we would come back. Other restaurants that we spent an evening at made us feel more welcome during Restaurant Week.
January 25, 2013|Restaurant week at Capital Grille|3|I took my lovely wife to Capital Grille for a night out during restaurant week. We wanted to taste what they had available for that specific menu. Selections were good for starters, entrees, and deserts. We ordered a bunch and here's what I think of it. Everything was ok but not excellent, which is what we expected from this place. Specifically, tournedos were served almost cold and my wife was not too happy with that. Also we ordered all the meat to be medium to medium well and all the meat eventually tasted like a burger. We understood that our selection of medium to medium well may have something to do with this but not the temperature it was served at. In any case, we have had better steak in a few other places.

We enjoyed our lunch immensely and will be back!!
January 24, 2013|Keep trying Capital Grille,|3|Keep trying Capital Grille, I want to like it. To start i had the chowder, it was creamy, and full of stock. I ordered the special app as well, 3 oz of crab meat, it was peeled, chilled and so very good. The dipping sauce was very good as well. I had the rib eye sandwich, and it was outstanding. Cooked perfectly, covered in cheese and onions. My wife had the cheeseburger, and it was good but the meat had some grizzle in it, which she didnt like. Overall, a good experience for lunch. For dessert we had the chocolate espresso cake and chocolate ice cream, both were great.
January 23, 2013|Friends Date Night|4|Went to Capital Grille a few days ago with 2 other friends. Although we had reservations, we had to wait as te Restaurant was packed (good sign for me). We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited until the hostess reached us. Food was delicious, spectacular steak-house! We had good service, the only (very small) complaint is that one of my friends ordered more butter but it never came. That didn't ruin our night obviously, but doesn't allow me to say the service was perfect either. Other than that, service was good and smooth. I would definitely recommend Capital Grille, and I wish I lived closer to Providence to enjoy their bar more often as I liked the scene very much.
January 23, 2013|Fantastic as always. Our waiter|5|Fantastic as always. Our waiter Tony wished me a happy birthday several times and brought us extra ice cream at dessert. I wish we could afford to go there all the time!

January 23, 2013|Good restaurant week lunch spot|5|"Always consistent. Went for restaurant week. Terrific service, as always. Had the burger and truffle fries. Burger was delicious (although med well instead of med as i ordered it) but didn't come with any condiments, truffle fries were okay. Started with the salad, but the lettuce was all wilted and dry, probably because of the 10 degree temps. Try the chowder instead next time. The chocolate cake was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Overall a positive experience. I'd definitely go back. Would like to see some updates to the menu and decor but I think many people love that I is ""classic."""
January 22, 2013|Not a great salad|4|We went for restaurant week. The only disappointing part was the salad since it is so simple to make. It was supposed to be field greens and vegetables but instead was romaine with one half if a tomato and two pieces of cucumber. Besides Tbsp, service was.great, the steak was delicious and overall a gold night.
January 22, 2013|Providence Restaurant Week Visit|3|We visited on Providence Restaurant Week, and participated in this specially priced menu. Capital Grill is a favorite of my wife and mine. This visit was not up to par. There were 4 of us, and we ordered 3 different cuts of beef. Two were cooked to the correct temperature; 2 were over-cooked. It's not enough to keep us from returning, but it was a disappointing evening nonetheless. The service by Tobias was excellent, however.
January 22, 2013|We went for lunch, and were|3|"We went for lunch, and were very disappointed. The food was definitely not worth the high price, so I definitely will not be going back. The appetizer salads were good, but very small. I ordered the signature burger and fries, but the burger came out on it's own, and I received the fries about 10 minutes later. The entree salad was served with greens, a chicken breast on the side, and a parmesan ""crisp"" that was soggy and pretty much inedible. The sorbet for dessert was very good, but didn't make up for the rest of the meal."
Dined on January 21, 2013|Disappointed. Probably the|1|Disappointed. Probably the most overhyped and overpriced place in Providence. Could not get water refilled, dinner was served while we were still eating salad. A medium rare dish was like that of a hockey puck. The only highlights were the Caesar salad and spinach. It is a finely polished and overpriced Outback or Texas Roadhouse.
January 21, 2013|This is the second time I've|3|This is the second time I've been to a Capital Grill. This latest time was in Providence. Love the atmosphere but I feel like it is very expensive for what is offered. everything is a la carte. $10 for a side of asparagus -- really? Our waiter was on the rude side, and in my opinions had way too many tables and was most interested in the large table of business travelers who were obviously not paying out of pocket!
January 19, 2013|It was restaurant week which|5|It was restaurant week which we didn't realize when I made the reservation. The restaurant was extremely busy. We had an 8:15 reservation and were seated on time. It was my wife's birthday. The table had rose pedals on it when we arrived. As always the food and service were outstanding.

January 19, 2013|Capitol Grille|5|Wonderful experience, first class service. So glad we selected Capital Grill for our special occasion. There were rose pedals scattered on the table for us. So thoughtful and romantic. Added bonus: free parking if you had a reservation! Can't wait to go bak in the summer and enjoy an outside dinning experience!
January 19, 2013|Restaurant Week - don't miss it|5|"We took advantage of the ""Restaurant Week"" promotion, which at $29.95 for a 3-course meal, is a great deal, particularly at this restaurant which can be pricey. I was surprised that the promotion was available on a Saturday night and we were both expecting smaller portions - and perhaps less than stellar service - wrong on both counts - everything was wonderful - Caesar salad, chowder, tournedoes and a Kobe sirloin, great sides, creme brulee for dessert - our waiter was attentive and we enjoyed a fine bottle of wine - a special evening out and a great value as well."
January 18, 2013|The grille scores again|5|Perfect choice for restaurant week! Kobi steak Caesar salad citrus salmon- flour less chocolate cake, etc a veritable stea,l although mobbed. Lots of people thought the same.

January 11, 2013|Could not have been better|5|The service was great the food was fabulous. The calamari was crispy but not overcooked, the hot peppers were a perfect complement to the dish. Every bite of the steak was perfectly grilled and the au grautin potatoes and asparagus were delicious. My mother and sister were with me and they were totally happy also. Not cheap but worth every single penny. I'm kicking myself for not having gone there sooner and will be back there soon.
December 31, 2012|"Just ""ok"""|3|"Good overall experience, but definitely not worth the money and probably won't go back. I had the filet which was ok. Definitely not the best filet I've ever had. For the money, I expected much more. My fiancé had the lamb and he described it as being ""ok"" and lacking flavor. Again, not worth the money if we're both saying just ""ok"". We enjoyed the salad and au gratin potatoes. The best thing we had all night was the cheesecake. Probably the only thing worth the money that we had that evening. Food was ok, restaurant itself beautiful, but again probably won't return. Waiter was very nice and knew everything about the menu."
December 31, 2012|We spend every New Year's|5|We spend every New Year's at Captial Grille, not because we are in a rut but because the food is so wonderful, the service is the best ever, and it is easy to get to and from. Mark Deland, again our waiter, was engaging and unhurried in all his dealings with my wife and me. His menu advice is always spot on and he is attentive beyond words. And now that we know they are open Christmas Eve? Well, we be there for that evening next time as well. Highly recommended in all respects!
December 31, 2012|Special experience every time!!!!|5|The original and the BEST Capital Grille! I love this place for their food but the service is what is really special. Great wait staff that knows the menu solid and also knows how to pair wine with your dinner. One of my all time favorites!

December 27, 2012|We took my son and his family|3|We took my son and his family here to celebrate the purchase of his first home. We frequent the Scotto fine dining chain on Long Island and took this opportunity to make a first visit to Capital Grille. (We had not yet tried the Capital Grille locations near our Orlando and Long Island homes.) Although the food was good, it does not compare to the Scotto restaurants we enjoy (Blackstone Grill, Rare 650 and Insignia). The steaks and sides were not special nor memorable. I would not go out of my way to visit this chain again. Thank you.
December 24, 2012|I think Capital Grille fell|3|I think Capital Grille fell a little short of our expectations on Christmas Eve. It was very busy, so our service was slower than usual. Our party of four was tucked in behind a party of 10 or 12, it was very awkward for both us and the Capital Grille staff. Food was very good but not outstanding as one might expect for $50 a-la-carte entrees.

November 25, 2012|We come to Capital Grille|5|We come to Capital Grille every year for our anniversary. The food is always exceptional & the service is incredible. If they know you are there for a special occasion, the table is sprinkled with rose petals, they provide glasses of champagne, & a wonderful dessert; all without requesting anything! Finally, they present you with new champagne flutes in a cloth cover as a momento. I have also entertained business guests here several times in the past & it has always been well received.
November 18, 2012|I am a Foodie, and the Capital|5|I am a Foodie, and the Capital Grille in Providence is my favorite resteraunt! Why? Because what they do, and how they do it, is as good as it gets. Steaks and sides are always fantastic, as befits a high end steak house, but the Capital Grille NEVER feels like a chain to me. The Signature Stoli Dolis are worth the visit in itself. The Calamari is the best I have had. I took my son, a 22 year old college graduate, landing his first job, and now landing his first steak house visit! He was blown away, the best meal of his life. Next time, he pays for DAD! Amazing night.

November 6, 2012|A wonderful, memorable occasion|5|My husband and I went to Capital Grille to celebrate his 80th birthday. When I made the reservation, I gave that information. Capital Grille could not have been more generous and gracious! They served us complimentary champagne at the beginning of our meal, a delicious amuse bouche, before our ordered appetizer, and two complimentary and delicious desserts at the end of our meal. Our waiter was knowledgable and very pleasant but not intrusive. I hope we can do the same for our birthday next year!

Dined on October 31, 2012|Service and food were excellent|5|Service and food were excellent as usual. The manager greets each table and any special requests are always accommodated. We ordered the cold shellfish platter and it was - as usual - excellent. My husband and I are usually pretty full by that point, but we split a porcini rubbed porterhouse with the amazing lobster macaroni & cheese and a caprese salad because we couldn't resist. The wine was divine; we always enjoy the Capital Grille immensely. One thing that I don't love, however, is that every time we dine here at least 3 of the staff asks us what the occasion is. We come once per month usually. It's almost demeaning in a way - I make my reservations on OpenTable, it would be noted if it were an occasion.

October 21, 2012|Our experience at Capital|5|Our experience at Capital Grille whether group party or romantic dinner we have a most delightful and marvelous time. Sunday, October 21, 2012 we celebrated my wife's birthday it was one of the more memorable evenings at Capital Grille. Our server Eric was simply outstanding, attentive, polite, knowledgeable. Capital Grille remains one of our favorite restuarants. Bob Silva, general manager, always arranges a special table, great server and allows my wife and I or guests a most remarkable and memorable evening. Thanks to Capital Grille and staff.
October 20, 2012|Did not deliver!|4|My wife and I were entertaining another couple. Restaurant did not honor our reservation and seated us 30 minutes late with a scant apology from the flustered hostess. Great food and service, but at these prices you expect and deserve an excellent dining experience and they certainly did not deliver.
October 20, 2012|The food -- especially the|4|The food -- especially the steak -- was trult delicious. The room was very loud (it waa difficult to hear the others at the table at times), but the night was still very enjoyable. Several of us preferred the old asparagus to the new grilled asparagus, and although a couple of the diners liked it fine, the consensus was that it was the weak point of the food.

We were told the reason for this was so we could have a certain waiter. We didn't want to sit there and were seated at a much better table in the rotunda with a wonderful waiter, Dan Beam. I'm glad we asked to be seated in the rotunda! Dan was an exceptional waiter!

Both steaks were overcooked - medium was well done, and medium rare was medium well. We didn't send them back, had mine not been a bit pinkish with the first few bites I would have. They did make things right by giving us a free side. Regardless, I expect for a near $75-100 pp restaurant that the steaks are always PERFECT.
October 8, 2012|We came in for lunch on Columbus|5|We came in for lunch on Columbus Day which was our 6th wedding anniversary. We ordered a french onion soup and the wedge salad we intended to share. Our server Josh offered to split them in half for us which was so nice! The filet and porter house we ordered were cooked perfectly. Josh brought us a complimentary chocolate cake with a candle in it to help us celebrate! With the Capital Grille in Providence, you just can't go wrong. Outstanding as always!

This was my third time there this week for dinner with friends, so I guess that is the best compliment and reference I can give the Capital Grill. Bob the Manager is always attentive, our waiter Matt (Mathew) appeared when you needed something-he just knew-but he gave us lots of private time to chat and catch up-perfect waiter!! Great week at the Capital Week...See you and your great staff real soon...Thank you for another perfect dining experience in every way."
September 11, 2012|My wife and I went to Capital|5|My wife and I went to Capital Grille on our 4th anniversary. It was truly an amazing experience. A decorated table was already waiting for us, with rose petals. We received complimentary champagne (raspberry inside), prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella and flour-less chocolate cake. Our lunch was sizable and my wife couldn't finish her salmon with avocado/mango salad. My lobster roll was outstanding, including the carrot/ginger soup and the truffle fries. After lunch, we went on having a nice stroll around the waterfire basin. It was truly a nice option.

August 18, 2012|Always a Great Experience!|5|Out of all the steak houses in the Boston/Providence area, Capital Grille is by far our favorite. We chose the Providence location because of the wonderful experience we've had there in the past, with not only the food, but the service. We requested a particular server whom we have had before and he really made this a special night for us as we were celebrating our anniversary. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and everything else, including our celebratory dessert, was absolutely delicious! We truly enjoyed our overall experience and were encouraged to take our time savoring our wine and each course.

July 19, 2012|Don't go at Restaurant Week|2|I went at restaurant week which in hindsight was not the best time as it was extremely busy at the front desk we were asked if we were here for restaurant week, then seated. Our waiter then gave us the restaurant week menu, took our order, asked if we wanted drinks and that was it. We should have been given the option of seeing the full menu in case we changed our mind. We saw a couple on the table behind having wonderful and attentive service (they did not choose the restaurant week menu) which I am sure is the norm; however that is not what we got. It was in and out and the table turned over. I did not feel this when I went to Ruth Chris’s or Providence Prime at restaurant week because I was treated as a regular paying customer and
Dined on July 19, 2012|Went midweek to dinner here|5|Went midweek to dinner here and food was awesome. Started meal with beef carpaccio, was flavorful and tender. Also had the shrimp cocktail, shrimp were large, firm and tasty. Cocktail sauce was perfect mix of horseradish and sauce. Had the Delmonico steak for entree, was tender and so flavorful. Girl had the filet, it was very good, but had to be sent back initially as it was under-cooked. manager gave us free fries for the mistake. Filet was very tender and tasty once cooked right. Service was top notch. When looking for a steak dinner I usually frequent Ruth's Chris, just love it there and one other visit to Captial Grille didnt go well. I like the decor at Capital better and will try it again after this last visit!

July 14, 2012|Disappointed|3|Disappointed...It was my first time dining at Capital Grille Providence and I am not planning to hurry back. Having heard rave reviews about the restaurant, I was left wondering about the basis of these rave reviews. Served in a comfortable envoronment, the food was just OK. The steak was disappointing - it was extremely charred on the outside but inside was well cooked. My steak seemed to have a lot of gristle as well. The breads and butter were delicious and the Ceasar salad was fresh, crispy and tasty. The highlight of our meal was the creme brulee - it was soft, creamy and rich topped with a lovely, crackly crust. The service was OK. Bottom line, there was nothing outstanding or extraordinary about this dining experience.
July 13, 2012|Restaurant week real deal|5|"My husband and I love the Providence Capital Grille. It's our go-to place for special occasions. Not a great place for vegetarians, but for a meat eater, it's the best. The steaks are outstanding. The Restaurant Week menu, which is often ""lite"" for the particular restaurant, was the real deal and a great bargain for a summer night."
July 13, 2012|Outstanding!!|5|My husband and I got out for date night and decided to go to Capital Grille, we had not been in 12 years. The food was awesome just like we remembered. The Waiter was so curious and prompt with everything answered our questions before asking. The atmosphere was wonderful very romantic. I would highly recommend Capital Grille!! Outstanding!!

My friend also asked for medium and hers was perfect. The waiter did not comment on why I had only eaten the edges of the burger and left a pile of raw meat in the middle so I told him it was undercooked. he apologised and said he would tell the chef. Great... that was super helpful to me LOL. Usually everything is great, including the service but, this time, it was not the best experience.

July 12, 2012|We were not seated in a timely|3|"We were not seated in a timely manner. People without reservations (we did have one) were seated before us because they ""knew someone"". It took 45 minutes after being seated to get a salad on the table. We had to ask for our dessert to go because my pregnant wife was uncomfortable and it was taking so long to get our food. With a reservation at 7:15 and getting our dessert to go, we still did not leave the restaurant until 9:15. That's just too long. I will say our waiter did a good job, but he was just unable to accommodate the amount of tables he had to help. I will also say the food was quite good, despite the wait. Overall, our experience wasn't great.. Maybe we should go on a Tuesday and not during restaurant week."
July 12, 2012|great service and great food|4|great service and great food Thanks you Eric our waiter staff and Matt the Chef!
July 12, 2012|Great Restaurant for a special|3|"Great Restaurant for a special occasion or making a great first impression on someone. Oddly enough, no one in the restaurant was under the age of 35(Im 21 so I felt treated like a little kid)! Service was just OK, check in was botched up due to a large group ahead of me. Portion size seemed to be a scaled down version of their normal meals. Overall, I would still choose Ruth's Chris Steakhouse next door over this restaurant(based on service and food choices). But since I went during Providence Restaurant week , it was a great deal and a eye-opening experience to the idea of ""power-dining""."

July 11, 2012|Maybe it happened to be a bad night|3|The food was very good, I was expecting better service... but a greet at the table just isn't enough. How about filling the glass of water before we yearn and wave someone down... Or how about bringing out the dessert less than 15 minutes wait after the entree is taken away? Overall, it was much a let down for something we were hoping to be one great night.
July 11, 2012|A swing and a miss ..........|3|I like the Grill , both Boston and Prov. but this time was a bit of a miss , Being shown to our table we were left in mid dinning room so host could go back and get what table we would sit at, the table it self rocked 2 or 3 inchs untill a host put a napkin under it ..... ,two of us at table ,I got dinner menu and my friend a lunch menu,our servier was good yet cool , after our meal he cleared our plates to show a dry plate size stain on the table cloth,it was the Grill so you know the food was wonderful ,just need to kick up the service to were it once was .

The steaks were very good, I probably just chose the wrong sauce/flavor which is why I only gave it a ""good"". The desserts were great and just overall, if you have the money to go for it, just do it. For 2 people w/desserts and cocktails the bill was over $200 just to give you an idea... but ... you get what you pay for. Its a great place to get dressed up for, bring excitement back to your date night... its well worth it..."

Our waiter was attentive, but we were not rushed. Our special occasion was aknowledged quite nicely. Will return. Easier to go to Providence vs. Boston. Really nice evening.
June 23, 2012|We were celebrating a birthday.|4|We were celebrating a birthday. The waiter and manager were noted to ask surrounding tables if there was a special occassion. But not at our table. Kinda disappointed that we were not recognized for have a special occassion. They gratefully split an appetizer for us and presented it nicely without an extra charge. Entrees were good.

Although not served by our favorite waiter, the fellow that did work the table was fantastic! But then again, all people are there. The service was very timely with plenty of time to talk, determine choices and place the orders. The food for all was perfectly prepared with everyone pleased with every aspect of the meal. The Bar and Bartenders were also exceptional with all drinks nicely priced and prepared. We will go back again for our anniversay in early July!

There is no question that the quality of the food and service at this capital grille is exceptional in every way.

Attention to detail made this celebration memorable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for any special occasion. Kudos for our server that night, Mr. Cy Lotito. He was knowledgeable about the dishes in the menu, funny and very efficient. Overall it was a great experience.

May 27, 2012|Awesome dinner!|5|Last minute pick for anniversary dinner. Awesome choice! It is expensive, but relative to other restaurants in town, quality of food and service it is well worth it. They deliver for a high-end restaurant. The service was spot on, our waiter Tom was excellent. He did everything just right, never missed a beat. Excellent trained staff!The quality of the food is very good, portions are on the large side which is unusual for a high end restaurant. My wife and I were both very pleased!

We truly enjoyed it and will return again. The ambiance was very nice, however, the jackets that the waiters wear (beige lab coats) takes away from the ambiance. A simple white shirt with a black tie or a white tuxedo shirt with a black bowtie would look better.

May 4, 2012|Although we have been to the|2|Although we have been to the Capital Grille many times for special occasions, this visit was less than satisfactory. From the time we arrived our servers seemed to be in a race to see who could bring out items faster and remove items from our table before we could finish the content. Although the manager intervened after our complaints, the mood for the evening had been ruined. It might be awhile before we return to this location again.

April 28, 2012|For the first time ever, we|2|For the first time ever, we had a bad meal at Capital Grille. We were quite surprised because it wasn't just one particular dish but the entire meal in general. The lobster bisque was fishy tasting, the onion soup was tepid at best. We all ordered dry aged bone-in sirloin. All but one was overcooked, one had a huge line of gristle going through the middle and all agreed the meat was tough. Nowhere near worth the $40+ price per steak. The steaks did not appear to be dry aged but regular sirloins and not great ones at that. The other appetizers were fine and dessert and coffee was good. Very disappointed.
April 28, 2012|Very Good Steak House! Good Service|4|"Very good steak place. Nice relaxed atmosphere and very good service. Not as ""stuffy"" or formal as one might expect upon first impressions. Service was friendly, attentive and helpful. Steaks were very good and cooked as ordered. Overall, food was very good. Not cheap, but prices are consistent with other competitive high end steak houses. Portions and cuts of meat are generous. Would definitely consider a return."
April 28, 2012|Thank You|5|Having been a guest of several locations I took my son there for a celebratory evening as he made Headmasters List for his grades. I let our waiter Matt know it was his first time there. Matt gave him the Royal Treatment, explained more about steak than my son knew existed. Our meal was wonderful, the service was fantastic and left me hoping for another great report card next quarter. With any luck we will be back soon

This was my first trip to the Providence location and the purpose was a little different - a first date. I had requested a private table when making the reservation and it was duly noted. From the moment I walked in the door, the experience at the Capital Grille was outstanding. The service, the food, the wine, the ambiance, and the romantic setting provided a perfect experience for my date and me. The staff was attentive to our needs, but respectful of our privacy. Kudos to the Capital Grille....

The food was excellent, as usual, and the Restaurant Week menu was an outstanding value. Our salmon and steaks were perfect. However, our waiter was clearly off his game. He spilled some calamari in someone's lap as he served it. Furthermore, one diner would order something (a glass of wine, a cup of coffee), and he would scurry off without ever asking the other diners if they wanted something. I would definitely go back, but would hope for a different waiter.
January 28, 2012|Proven Providence legend...|4|While there are a dozen or so great restaurants in Providence that aren't chains, it is important to remember that CG started as a Providence-only restaurant when a lot of places were going under and Ruth's wouldn't have set foot in the city. It is a great steakhouse in a great city, with touches of Chicago and New York thrown in (think Gibson's and Old Homestead). The service is formal but very friendly, the steaks and sides are all very good, and you feel like you're truly dining out. Fun for groups, families, dates...and maybe best steak in RI.

We were seated at a table that was so tight, every person that walked by had to turn sideways to get by. The other waiters were incredibly rude as they walked by. One even took our menus that he thought were in the way to passerbys and put them on the floor by our chair. The food was just okay. Glad it was restaurant week and we didn't pay full price.

They served a large basket of various breads and someone refilled it quickly after we finished what was there. I ordered the dry aged sirloin and it was delicious and cooked medium rare as asked. My boyfriend ordered the salmon and though it was terrific. He loved the sauce and wants to go back again for it. A friend ordered the filet mignon; he's picky and loved it. They served a large dish sides: mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth but still had small soft chunks and skin, which I liked. The creamed spinach was a surprising pleaser, I even went back for seconds. Creme brulee is best I've had and oddly goes well with the tangy raspberry sorbet!

I had a 14 oz. steak and Diane the salmon. She said it was the best she has had. The steak was great, cooked perfectly, black and blue. Waitstaff could not have been nicer. Just a couple of days left. Don't miss it.

We ordered appetizers and then from the special menu. The filet was a melt in your mouth choice, the sides and dessert, everything was delicious! The Capital Grille puts such a nice personal touch on everything, it's like you are their only guests! Nice place to go for any occasion, certainly you will leave with a memorable evening!

November 25, 2011|My husband loved the food.|4|My husband loved the food. The grill lamb is the best lamb he ever tried. My kona aged steak was good and flavorful. Service was a disappointment. My waiter is too busy. I have to ask other staff to get me milk for my tea, and tea was way too strong. I also waited 20 minutes and have to make an effor to call my waiter to get me my check as he was busy serving other table.

The Lobster Bisque (soup of the day) was outstanding, very creamy and true to the server's description there was a good amount of lobster in the cup as well. The Lobster and Crabcake sandwich was a wonderful choice, light with almost no filler, we will definitely eat here again.

November 11, 2011|A propos|4|We took our time ordering, and asked many questions, as I don't frequent the establishment. I asked for water with lemon and didn't receive the lemon until I asked a second time. I also asked for an olive oil, hot pepper and garlic mix for the bread and only received the garlic with it on the second helping. The scallops special was delicious and the a la cart servings of creamed corn with bacon and au gratin potatoes were overwhelming in size. The corn was flavorful but the au gratin potatoes lacked much taste. The stuffed shrimp, crab and lobster dish my friend had was also very good and tasty.
November 5, 2011|Too Loud, Boring food|3|This restaurant is very loud. We went to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. Our seating was so close to other diners that we could not talk to each other without hollering. The father and son sitting beside us had a conflict where we had to hear the son use profanity, as punctuation. Though we were seated before others around us, we were served last. The food tasted fine, but not 'divine' as the price would suggest. The portions were too big, with nothing subtle for flavors. All in all loud and boring food.

But especially impressive was our waiter Matt Walters. He just did everything right - personable, helpful, and had just the right, knowledgeable touch that made the evening especially enjoyable for us. He understands his customers. Matt alone is worth the visit. One small example of CG's attention was when I commented to Matt that I surprised how empty the restaurant was but we had a problem on Opentable making a reservation. A few minutes later, manager came over, apologized, said they would take steps to correct and seem to have followed up.

The service was extraordinary and the food was delicious! From the moment we arrived to the momenet we left, we felt like they were attentive to our every request and did so with a smile on their faces. Our table was decorated with rose petals and upon sitting they brought us two glasses of champagne so we could toast our anniversary. We both ordered steak and it was delicous and done just the way we like it! To top it all off, they brought us a piece of flourless chocolate cake that was also delicious. We couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate!

I've never ordered something a particular way and been disappointed. The staff is friendly and professional, however they could speed up service a little bit. They ask at the beginning of your meal if you're in a rush and if you say you're not, the meal is very drawn out, which I understand as far as relaxation goes. Overall outstanding and worth the money every time. The specials are fabulous, too!

They led us to a table by a window. The table had rose petals strewn about. We were served complimentary champagne with fresh raspberries. The service was great. At the end of the meal we were served a complimentary dessert - flourless chocolate cake, which is what we would've ordered. It was delicious as was the food and even the coffee.

September 5, 2011|Fun Celebration|5|My son (a culinary student from JWU) wanted to go to Capital Grille for his 19th birthday. What a great choice for a celebration dinner! The service was professional, knowledgeable, and very courteous. The food was excellent, and my husband said his steak was the best he'd had in years. We even had desert which was also delicious. The staff made a special effort to make my son feel special, and he really enjoyed the evening.
August 24, 2011|Despite a somewhat rocky start|5|"Despite a somewhat rocky start with the hostess drooling over a party of 3 men ahead of us (making us all stand there and wait until she was done and - needless to say - we did not get the same level of attention, having no men in the party), the Capital Grille did not fail to deliver! The food is fabulous, the service superb. Summer fare gets royal treatment here, including creamed corn (not like DelMonte's)-fresh, sweet corn in a light bath of cream with onion and smoked bacon: perfection! And local Poppasquash oysters - large, briney, and tasty. If you love oysters, don't miss them! While I didn't partake, CG is having a ""Generous Pour""-9 excellent wines for just $25. Run, don't walk to enjoy the best of summer done right!"

So, used Open Table to make reservation and inform them that this was for a birthday and anniversary celebration and that I wanted a nice table and the best waiter.

They brought out 2 desserts on the house in recognition of the birthday and anniversary. Steaks and appetizers were excellent. Just overall a great experience.

August 2, 2011|Top Shelf All The Way|4|Classy, classy This restaurant in the downtown Providence, RI is one of a kind and yes before you ask save up your money. This is not your corner burger joint nor is it your fast food, or typical lower end restaurant. This restaurant is very special with very special service from the moment you walk through the door. You'll also notice that the waiters are dressed to perfection and tables are set very nicely in typical white linen tradition. Also you will notice that the waiters do not write your order down they memorize everything! London our waiter was amazing!
July 26, 2011|Simply Superb!!!|5|Simply Superb! In addition to the great menu and the best steaks around, the Capital Grille provides all the little extras that make dining an experience rather than just a meal!. We usually dine at the New York location in the Chrysler Building. We were in New England for a few days celebrating my birthday and decided that since there was a location in Providence we would go there for my birthday dinner. When the Providence location called me in the morning to confirm, they informed me that they had already called the NYC location and had all our preferences for cooking and serving (e.g. I do not like the extra liquid Au-Jus gravy on my steak). Wow! That is the best Customer Service I have experienced in a log time. I am impressed.

Our lunch and dinner choices were made from the prix fixe menu that is offered during that time period. Both meals were outstanding as was the service we received. The clam chowder, lobster roll, and miniature tenderloin sandwiches we had for lunch were delicious, as was the filet mignon we had at dinner. That said, a meal here could get pricey, if ordered from the regular menu, and it's not a restaurant where we would dine frequently...perhaps for a special occasion.
July 20, 2011|Perfect anniversary dinner!|5|"We have been to Capital Grille in Providence a number of times and always leave thrilled with our experience - both food and service. This particular trip was for our 20th wedding anniversary. We noted this on our Open Table reservation request. When we arrived, there were rose petals on the table and everyone greeted us with a ""Happy Anniversary"". We requested our favorite waiter - Eric; and, as always were treated with the most excellent service. It was a surprise to us that it was Restaurant Week. I decided to choose food from the special menu and my husband chose from the main menu. Everything was cooked to perfection. As a special treat, Eric brought an extra dessert for us to celebrate our special occasion. Perfect night!"

They also are running a wine tasting for the summer that I'd like to return for! Think that would be a great girls night, sit out side, where they had entertainment, however you couldn't hear it inside at all--which is great if you want your dinner a little more quiet. Overall it was a perfect evening in Providence.

July 13, 2011|The overall experience did|4|The overall experience did not meet our expectations from previous visits. Service staff was not adequate for the crowd and combined with Restaurant Week and the summer wine event we were somewhat disappointed, especially in the delay to be seated and the long wait for our meal. However, the food was excellent and the summer wine event, The Generous Pour, were outstanding. We are confident that the service issue is abnormal and the service will fully meet expectations on our next visit.

We thought this one of the best deals for restaurant week that we've encountered, and the wine tasting for $25 was a pure joy -- we left with the names of several we will seek out for purchase in the future.
July 12, 2011|Very nice experience|4|Went during Restaurant Week, and we were treated as though we paid full price. Excellent, friendly service - but not overly friendly, thank goodness. Very good food. We were in and out quickly but were not rushed. Fun dressed-up adult atmosphere - like being in a restaurant from a movie made in the 70's about the 40's! Michael Corleone may have taken Kay there when they were dating.....

While the menu is not long and is enhanced by a few daily specialities, those wishing a robust and marvelous experience will not miss here. Wines are fine, whether by bottle or glass, with changing 'featured' offerings by glass. The bar is great...skilled mixoligists. The ambience is expense-account, warm but masculine in a re-done train station.

June 16, 2011|It is one of our favorite|5|It is one of our favorite restaurants. We enjoy Chris Reynolds as a server. Very efficient and attentive.
June 4, 2011|Poor Management AVOID|1|The management is so rude I will never return. I have been going here for years, but would no longer recommend it. In the effort to squeeze every single penny out of this place the management sat a table meant for 5 with 9 or more people next to me and my wife. The waitstaff could not walk by, the waiter could not wait on us (not that he tried) and a perfectly decent evening was ruined so that Capital Grille could squeeze extra people into a table. So, if you are expecting a comfortable, relaxing evening at an expensive restaurant, forget about it! Rude, boorish amateur behavior! AVOID, plenty of other nice restaurants in the area that treat you as if you are a customer!
June 4, 2011|Great evening|5|My wife and I celebrated our 28th wedding anniversary at the Capital Grille. The steaks were the best we've had in many years. Our server Tim, was there when we needed him and made some great recommendations. We could not have has a better evening
June 3, 2011|Mixed Review|3|Our waiter was great. Wine and appetizers were great. The waiter split a salad for us. I ordered the filet steak special medium rare. A food runner served it. I cut into it and it was medium well. I called him back and told him. He asked me to cut into it to see it for himself. The waiter and the manager returned and apologized. A replacement steak was brought to the table by the time my dining companion finished his meal. The steak was med. rare, but it was dry and the topping had an unusual taste, which I didn't like. At this point I wasn't interested in eating the steak. We had it wrapped to take with us, but since we were staying at a hotel we gave it to a homeless person outside of the restaurant.

Once we were seated, rose petals were scattered on our table. We were given a glass of sparkling wine to toast each other.

May 14, 2011|This was our 22nd wedding|4|This was our 22nd wedding anniversary and Capital Grill made it very special. Once we checked in we were greeted by name by the person who sat us as well as our server. The Lobster Mac & Cheese appears to have been in the oven a little to long but still delicious. Can't wait to return

April 30, 2011|Dining at the Capital Grille|4|Dining at the Capital Grille is always good - dining at the one in Provicence is great! We had dinner last Saturday evening after a show and enjoyed everything. The service was excellent, our waiter in particular was very nice. Steaks and sides are generous & delicious. The coconut cream pie gets the gold star! One of the best desserts in all of the various steak restaurants in Providence. We highly recomment the Capital Grille Providence and look forward to going back.
April 29, 2011|Bravo!|5|Always outstanding, never a disappointment. Their lobster mac&cheese is crave worthy and the service is consistently top notch.

April 16, 2011|Above & Beyond|5|As always, tremendous food and outstanding service. We had 2 vegetarians in the party and the Exectutive Chef, Matt, came out to our table and discussed with them exactly how they would like their meal prepared in order to satisfy all their nutritonal needs. That's above and beyond service. Plus, their meal was delicious!
April 9, 2011|I love the food here, but|4|I love the food here, but the noise level really got to me this time. I think I will ask for a corner table versus being in the middle of the restaurant next time. Other than that the steaks always are a hit for me! Our server was great too!

The maitre'd greeted us warmly, seated us directly, and spoke with us for a few minutes - it was very welcoming. Our waiter was attentive and pleasant, and made several good suggestions regarding the meals, including offering half portions of our sides, which was perfect for two people. The only disappointment for me was that my steak was a little tough to me, but that might have been the cut of the meat. We were also visited by two managers, which was not intrusive but welcoming. We will return

March 20, 2011|The most amazing hospitality|5|The most amazing hospitality and dining experience we've ever had in the country. Period. Our server Nicole offered us her CAR to use instead of having to take public transportation since we are staying at a local hotel for 5 weeks and she is working a double anyways. The manager on duty was Stephen Lydon and also gave us his cell phone number in case we needed anything. Both made our night very special as it was our anniversary and we will be telling Everyone about our experience there!! Thank you!!!
March 20, 2011|Expensive, yes; great food, no|2|We were disappointed. Huge portions at high prices (for Providence), with in-your-face flavors that one quickly tires of. Limited creativity, no subtlety, no complexity from novel combinations of flavors. It's really a steak house, which we weren't quite aware of. True, the meat is good (though not superior to the better places in town), but do you really want to pay $42 for a 22 oz steak, $9 for a potato side, and $9 more for a vegetable side? Oh, and add a glass of wine for $10-$18. So many restaurants in this town that are much better and more reasonably priced: Local 121, Gracies's, Mill's Tavern, Chez Pascal, Cafe Nuovo, Al Forno, Loie Fuller's, Nick's on Broadway...
March 19, 2011|Consistently Excellent|5|Reaffirming my earlier review (8/2010) I am pleased to say nothing has changed here. The original Capital Grille still delivers in every way. Consistently excellent!
March 13, 2011|Best of the 3 branded Steakouses|4|"Best of the 3 branded Steakouses in the downtown ""waterfire"" area. Parmesan truffle fries are deliciously addictive. Service was attentive. Appreciated recognition of birthday."
March 4, 2011|Just an average steak house|3|We requested a quiet table and were seated very close to the kitchen. It was too bright and a little too loud. Our server, Chuck, was ok but didn't seem to know a lot about the wine list. He steered us to an ok wine; not really very good for the price. Food was good but not great. To us this is just an average restaurant; there's nothing really wrong with it but it's nothing to rave about either. As I specified that it was an anniversary in my Open Table rez. we had rose petals on the table. It's a nice touch but a little annoying when food is on the table. We were treated to glasses of champagne and a creme brulee which was nice.
March 3, 2011|Capital sizzle|4|This was the first capital grill built. it is a very upper crust experience for the most part. I had been there before and was cebrating the closing of a big business deal. I didn't appreciate the attempt to sit us at an inferior Table near the kitchen entrance when plenty of better seating was avaable. They were gracious enough to reseat us upon my request. Ken our waiter Was fabulous! Attentive and helpful with just enough space between checkins The main course while flavorful lacked presentation and appeared too charred. We asked for medium well but it looked a little like a BBQ grease flare up. I know fine steak houses frown upon anything but rare, but the presentation was not what I had previously experienced at capital grill
February 26, 2011|Try the Tuna!|4|Love the atmosphere. Mark is always our favorite waiter but he was busy so we had Tom and he was great as well. Wedge salad and tomato mozzarella salads were perfect. The sushi-grade tuna was excellent as well. Always a great meal when u dine at capital grille.
February 26, 2011|Capital Grille.......great as usual|5|Superb night. Tom our server was great and all of the food ordered was excellent.
February 26, 2011|Expensive for the quality|4|Food was just okay, particularly for the impressively high prices. Service, however, was exceptional, as is the ambiance. In the end, there is better food available (including better steak) for less in Providence.

February 19, 2011|Waited 30 mins for our reservation,|2|Waited 30 mins for our reservation, but that's ok. Service was slow and inattentive, he even forgot our steak knives. Appetizers were very good, but steaks were not cooked properly at all. Ordered the 2 petite filets with lobster med-rare. Got 1 med-well & 1 well done. Husband ordered the delmonico med-rare, but received a very rare steak. Server never came back to check on us, so we couldn't even send the food back. The restaurant was extremely loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation across the table. Also, it was uncomfortably cold inside. Had a sweater on, but was still cold. Save your money, and go elsewhere! This is not fine dining.
February 19, 2011|Was a very nice dinner. Capital|4|Was a very nice dinner. Capital grille seems more commercialized now but it was good.
February 18, 2011|Not good|3|Not the first time I have been here and probably the least pleasant. Waiter (named Eric I think) was kind of pretentious but not very good - he poured me sparkling water but neglected my companion, twice, until he finally got the idea after I did it. The food was only ok, the apps were good particularly the lobster/crab cakes but the steak entrees were ok at best. My tenderloin was not very tender. Overall, blah with especially bad marks for service.
February 13, 2011|Posh and fit for a special|3|"Posh and fit for a special occasion, yes, but I've had better steak for less money at Hemenways. A little too ""self congratulatory"" service by a waiter who disappeared halfway through the meal. Seems to be coasting on it's reputation. My wife and I both wanted to like the restaurant, but left disappointed."
February 4, 2011|Several of us went for dinner.|3|Several of us went for dinner. Several asked for medium rare steaks....all of those came to the table Medium to Medium Well. The waiter Ken was not very pleasant not attentive, so we did not want to complain, we feared that would make him mad and spit on our food. Other times I have been to the Capital Grille the food and the service was very good. This time it was not good.
February 3, 2011|Daniel was a great waiter.|5|Daniel was a great waiter. Attentive, providing good recommendations and very much on top of things. Always ready to ask if we needed more wine, water, etc. Great service.
January 29, 2011|As always, Capital Grille|4|"As always, Capital Grille is awesome. My only ""complaint"" is that if you are not spending a lot of money, you seem to be somewhat rushed. Although it is not obvious, you can feel it. We were there for the restaurant week on Saturday night. We had the 29.95 per person meals, with no extras except a glass of wine. I think they want to turn the tables over quickly in that case. In the past when I have been there ordering off the regular menu, I was there for a long time without that same feeling. Not a big deal and certainly wouldn't ever stop me from going again. Food is just awesome. Kona crusted bone in sirloin is unbelievable."

The service is impeccable yet not overbearing. Our waiter, Ron, gets kudos for a superb job. This is a restaurant that doesn't make a the food presentation overly fussy but the quality is excellent. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The best place in Providence for a special night out or important business diner.

Drinks were superbly made and wine list was terrific. Meat entree cooked exactly as requested. Service as usual was friendly and professional, always helpful. We are ""frequent flyers"" for all the right reasons in this best place in Providence!"
December 18, 2010|"Great place, very nice atmosphere.
"|5|Great place, very nice atmosphere. The food was the start of the show, as usual. Parmesan Truffle Fries must be tried before you pass on. The meat was fresh and juicy. The clam chowder is perfect, and can be eaten without the bag of crackers. One thing I noticed is that they serve a triangle of butter, instead of the nice whipped butter on Newbury Street. Portions appeared to be slightly smaller than at Newbury Street too. Overall, incredible food, you should go.

The shellfish platter is always a treat, love the dry-aged steaks, the service is always on point. I was pleased to see they are still serving the bone-in sirloin with the kona coffee rub, sorry they seem to have dropped the white chocolate mousse...oh well, you can't have everything.
November 12, 2010|I had requested a quiet table|5|I had requested a quiet table as it was a party of 2, and we were seated in the wine room which was very nice.

November 6, 2010|As always, the food was fantastic.|5|As always, the food was fantastic. Our waiter, Mark, was knowledgeable not only about the food but the wine list as well. I had the sushi-grade Tuna with 3 dipping sauces over ginger rice - it was perfect. I'm not one to get the same thing when I dine out; however, this is a dish I would eat over and over again. Compliments to the chef!

October 26, 2010|It was our 36th wedding anniversary|5|"It was our 36th wedding anniversary and a ""special night."" The maitre d' asked us when we checked in, if it happened to be a special occasion. When we said it was our anniversary, they put at us a table which was strewn with rose petals and also gave us a freee dessert. The waiter was very attentive and the maitre d' came over a couple of times to make sure that our night continued to be special. I have been at this restaurant at numerous other times, mostly in relatively large (18-20 people) business group settings and the service has sometimes been a little slow but the food is always excellent. The parking in the area can be pricey but the Capital Grill always validates for free parking. Probably the top spot to dine in ""downcity."""
October 23, 2010|My wife & I sat in the Wine|2|My wife & I sat in the Wine Room Section; sort of a large walk-in closet. The room was too small, the walls filled with wine cabinets too close and too noisy. The chairs were uncomfortable; we were told this is a regular complaint. The place was packed and stayed packed throughout our stay which ended at 9:15. People must know something we don't. The food was very good except for the very pedestrian chopped salad that wasn't chopped. The service was good bordering on intrusive. The tablets were much too close together causing the uncompable chairs to be much to close to the tablet. It was obvious food was served as quickly as possible to gain turnover. My money could have been spent much better than here.
October 23, 2010|This is where the chain started.|4|"This is where the chain started. For meat lovers, it is a great evening! Our server couldn""t have been more pleasant and professional. The restaurant itself was a bit hard to find as its address pulls up another location in Providence. Now that we know where it is, we will be back when we are in the mood for a steak indulgence."
October 22, 2010|Excellent steaks and side|4|Excellent steaks and side dishes. Very friendly and attentive service. They went out of their way to make our special occasion special with rose petals and flourless chocolate cake with a candle. Medium-large restaurant with a fair amount of noise on a Friday night.

For my money, it's the best of all the steakhouses--Morton's Palm, Ruth's, etc. Excellent service from Knowlton. Great wine and a wonderful complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Two negatives--Jersey Shore hostesses that assurred us that our ""table was being set"" multiple times as we were sat 35 minutes late for our 8:30 reservation. And, table that was adjacent to the kitchen--Noisy! Don't mind cooking banter and pots and pans, but the bus staff and dishwashers really need to take it easy on the plates!"

THe food was all fantastic and the bill was incredibly reasonable for the amount and quality of the food and wine.

July 24, 2010|The steaks were great and|5|The steaks were great and the desserts, out of this world! We noted in our Open Table reservation that it was our anniversary, and when we were seated, there were rose petals sprinkled on our table. A really nice touch! The waitstaff was very attentive. We would definitely go back for a special occasion.
July 23, 2010|I have eaten at all of the|3|I have eaten at all of the standard fine steakhouses. I know to expect a certain level of service, attention, and quality of food. I ate there with my wife and another couple during restaurant week and ordered from the special menu. While I understand that we were not paying the typical prices for our meal, I expected to receive the same top-notch service. Our waiter was pleasant and competent, but the moment we indicated we were ordering from the restaurant week menu, he went into fast forward. He decided to choose our sides for us before we corrected him. He pushed the table through our soup/salad course and lurked during the entrée. To make it worse, my steak was average at best. I won't return, Restaurant Week or otherwise.
July 23, 2010|This was our first time here|5|This was our first time here & we decided to try it out as it was Providence Restaurant Week. The food was excellant, cooked to perfection. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was right on top of things, friendly and personable. This is a top notch find.
July 22, 2010|We went twice during restaurant|4|We went twice during restaurant week. Both times had the sliced steak. (The first time two of the four offerings were not available.) The steak was done perfectly and the wine tasting was a great value. Our waiter was attentive and friendly and very helpful in explaining the wines.

July 11, 2010|We simply had one of the best|5|We simply had one of the best meals ever experienced. Some of us at the table are in the food service business or travel globally and have tried many many meals. It is both restaurant week and special wine tasting (1 sparkling, 3 whites and 6 reds). 3 of the 4 indulged and before you knew it 30 glasses passed through the table. The prix-fixe was worthy of the full menu. The waitstaff was beyond exceptional enjoying our time together with the wines, the food and atmosphere. The only main we did not try was the filet but this is just a great piece of carne we opted to go for the flavor to match the vino. The value was unheard of when we finally recieved the bill. We'll do this again soon with a slighly larger group. Cheers!

June 12, 2010|While expensive, you always|4|While expensive, you always know what you are going to get with Capital Grille and you can always count on it being terrific. We shared the king crab leg appetizer special and it was amazing. Also available in a larger size as an entree - next time I'd be tempted, if it was available, but it would be hard to give up an excellent steak. Drinks were surprisingly reasonably priced for top shelf. Even though we've visited several times before, we just found out that the sides can be ordered in half size - good to know for future dining.
June 12, 2010|This restaurant is very good.|3|This restaurant is very good. However, the table was so crowded in a corner that we could barely move. The waitress was excellent and handled oou daughter's birthday extremely well. Noice level was high and hard to hear other people talk.

I had requested a nice romantice table for our anniversary, what a surprise to be brought to a nice quiet table with rose petals, our waiter Ron was great, paced the meal for us so we could get to the theater on time. The meal was finished with a nice piece of cake and candle. What a nice dining experience, it's been awhile since we have been back to the Providence Capital Grill, it won't be long before we return this time. Clearly they have edge on Flemings & Ruth Chris. Thank You!
June 4, 2010|Our evening was wonderful!!!!!|5|Our evening was wonderful!!!!! We were celebrating our 30th anniversary and they went out of their way to make it memorable. We had a beautiful view of the river, rose petals on the table, great service with Kyle; who took our picture with their camera and then gave it to us along with two of their great desserts with candles for our special day. Captial Grille food is always excellent - Providence seems a cut above the others we have been too. Kyle, our waiter, went out of his way. His recommendations were right on target - from the wines to the sides. My husband had the bone in kona and I the double bone lamb chops just superb. Clam chowder and lobster bisque out of this world. To top it all of they validated our parking. It was great!!!!

May 28, 2010|We always love the Capitol|4|We always love the Capitol Grill but we always complain that the steaks are not as good as David Burke's. I suspect they don't age them as long as they should. Anyway, the overall meal, atmosphere and service get an 'A' while steaks alone get a 'B'.

Ordered the recommended chefs dish - beef and lobster, food was okay, skimpy on the lobster. Partner ordered an aged sirloin, not very tender. Overall a little disappointing since we heard great things about the restauant and it is pricey so you expect perfection. Felt that they could at least added a vegetable to the meal. Everything is a-la-cart. Sides are enough to share with 3 or 4 people. Enjoyed a couple of glasses of Hess Chardonay (over priced for Hess). Service was good. We would try it again but for lunch. Not in any rush to go back. Very Noisy -

The food was delicious and they served the regular, full menu (which is nice since so many restaurants force patrons to order off a special menu on that day). The server was especially kind to my mother and the kitchen sent her home with chocolate truffles, made on site, as a special Mother's Day treat.

April 2, 2010|My first visit to Capital|4|My first visit to Capital Grill was just ok. The place is beautiful, the service outstanding, but my entrée was cold. I had the lobster bisque and it was great, huge chunks of lobster. We had the parmesan truffle french fries and asparagus sides, both were great, the french fries were very tasty. Cafe Noir has a similar french fry dish, these might have been slightly tastier. My son had the filet, and was cooked perfectly and very tender. I had the tenderloin and butter poached lobster, and while the steak was tender and cooked to my liking, it was cold. I should have sent it back, but our reservations were for 930, it was closing in on 1030, and I was tired and hungry. Perhaps they should adopt Ruth's Chris policy of heated plates.

The staff was very professional and knowledgable about the menu items. Our seating was ok we did have a corner table which I like. But I was facing the kitchen and see what was going on and it was a little loud and disruptive for my taste. On a good note. The head chef did not seem to notice that I could see what was going on and he ran his kitchen well and things were flowing out of there quickly and neatly with no confusion it seemed.

It was Valentine's day weekend and the place was packed and I was concerned that the service, if not the food would be compromised. We had that situation at the Philadelphia location several years ago. I could not have been more wrong. The service was excellent, the food cooked exactly as ordered and it was just a wonderful experience. The staff at the Providence location really has it together!

We were quiet during our meal, which signifies utmost satisfaction. Dessert (chocolate hazelnut cake) could have served 4+ people. We only sampled this (took the rest home). The cake was perfectly moist and tasty. Our waiter could have been more attentive. There were noticable delays in his tending to our table. Very good experience. The prices are high, and in this economy, we will have to wait until a special occasion to return.
December 31, 2009|When most restaurants fail|5|When most restaurants fail at providing good food and good service on New Year's Eve, Capital Grille stood out among the rest to provide a fantastic dining experience. From the Hostesses waiting to seat you to the wait staff, all was excellent. Our waiter, Mark, was very attentive to our needs and our water glasses were always refilled by the bus boy. The restaurant was filled, yet nothing was missed from appetizer to dessert. As everything is a la carte, it is without a doubt pricey, but well worth the excellent food and service for a special occasion.
December 31, 2009|Overpriced...Pros: Service|2|Overpriced...Pros: Service was very good, attentive, but not overbearing. Very Nice wine list Cons: very noisy, difficult to carry on a converstation. Food was ok the check was $300 for 2 people....it was a good meal, but NO WAY was it worth that price.(I'm fine spending that when it's worth it) One of 2 steaks was not cooked properly (a real problem for me in an upscale steak house). Sides were good, but again, not worth the price Overall, if you live in an area where there is a Capital Grille I'm sure you have other choices that will be better tasting and easier on your wallet.
December 31, 2009|As usual, this was a great|5|As usual, this was a great meal. It was New Years' Eve and they were packed, but service was still wonderful. We had Tim as our server. He was laid back and cordial. I had the Delmonico, that was a little tougher than aged prime steak should be, but still very good. I'm a big steak fan and get really fussy about my steaks. I like them dry aged for at least 30 days. These were not quite there. My favorite steak house is David Burke's who rates a 10 in my book. Capital grill hits a 9. Overall great meal and great service.

The seafood platter is just short of Joe's Stone Crab in Miami Beach, and the steaks are solid. The atmosphere was lively and the service was what i expect of a good steak house. The veal chop on my second visit was a bit small, but perfectly cooked. I will go again.

It was a Thursday afternoon, and we were expecting to have a great meals and great services. Niether was the case. Upon entering the Capital Grille, we were greated by a pleasant hostess who showed us to the coat room and then to our table. It then took 10 minutes for our waiter to stop by to take our drink and app orders, and then another 30 minutes for our waiter to take a entree orders. When the food finally, came out the steaks were all over cooked and lacked flavor. One of the members of my party hinted that his was too well done to the waiter, but the waiter just blew us off and did not return for sometime. Won't be going here again!

What was not expected is getting bilked for parking despite parking validation. Not much compared to cost of meal, but free parking would have been nice. Some of the dress for this style restaurant was pretty casual, and the crew from the table next to us just left the set of the Sopranos. But maybe that's unavoidable given location.

November 6, 2009|We went to celebrate a birthday|3|We went to celebrate a birthday for my son. The service was wonderful. Our booth and the atmosphere was what you would expect from a nicer steakhouse. The problem was the steaks were just mediocre. Out of the six of us in the party, four of us had steaks and they were all just average. For over $40 a steak, you would expect them to be mouth wateringly delicious. If you want a good steak in Providence, I would go to Fleming's, Ruth's Chris, or 10 before going back.
Dined on November 5, 2009|Service was excellent. Food|3|Service was excellent. Food quality and pricing was on par with any other high end steakhouse chain. Menu was very steakhouse, with limited options outside of steak, so don't take someone who doesn't enjoy beef. I think I'm getting tired of steakhouses.
October 28, 2009|The Capital Grille is carnovire|3|"The Capital Grille is carnovire heaven, although the kitchen does justice to fish fare as well. Portions are HUGE. The wine list is impressive, and there are, indeed, a number of selections for less than $30. Our waiter was most personable and efficient. Check out the personal wine ""cubby holes"" as you enter."
October 28, 2009|My husband and I were celebrating|4|My husband and I were celebrating our 48th wedding anniversary and the ambiance was quite condusive to this special celebration. It's ironic that you ask about the noise level, because the last time we were there, it was extremely noisy and that was a turnoff to us. This time, however, this was not an issue at all, although we did dine rather early (6:15). I chose the onion soup, ceasar salad, and Alaskan King Crab legs, all of which I enjoyed very much. My husband chose the lobster bisque, ceasar salad, and swordfish. The first two selections were very good, but the swordfish was quite dry (overcooked, I presume). Sorry to say, he was disappointed in his selection. I was quite impressed with the high level of service we got from Corey.

I had fish (seared ahi tuna) which was terrible -- dry and tasteless. On the other hand, the calimari appetizer with spicy peppers was one of the best I've ever had. Fun place to come with a group. A little loud and not really a good spot for a romantic night (we went on Sat night). Our waiter had absolutely zero personality and could not recommend a bottle of wine. How disappointing in a place with a big wine list.

Set in a restored old train station.Tables on the side were quite close to others, Food was excellent, cooked just as ordered, and served promptly. Service was very good and professional. They had some reasonably priced wines, such as a minor French bordeaux for $32, although it was served a bit chilled. Steaks were large and very tasty. Our very pleasant waiter was a friend of someone we knew, and served us some complimentary desserts. All in all, a very nice dinner, and on a par with, in all aspects including price, Mortons, Ruth Chris, Palm, Wolenskis, etc. Nothing to distinguish them from these other chains, either. Price for two with one bottle of wine was about $160 with 20% tip

We were seated promptly and the hostess was very pleasant. Our busboy was exemplary. Our waiter, however, was mediocre at best. As we had never been before, we opted for the Restaurant Week menu. This was the point where we both felt our experience went downhill. Our waiter became condescending when we stated what we wished to order, as though we were wasting his time. He took our entire order at the time, including dessert, which did not give either of us an adequate time to consider what we wanted. We saw the managers more than we saw our waiter. My meal was good, though my wife's steak gristly.
July 11, 2009|I took my Significant Other|5|I took my Significant Other (husband-equivalent) there for his birthday and I have to say that it exceeded expectations. I thought it would have great steaks, but although I had looked at the menu, I wasn't prepared for the very interesting preparations that were served. The service was outstanding and the front staff were very helpful about parking and validations and so on. I didn't see in the reviews that the restaurant serves complimentary yummy dessert for special occasions, but that was very much appreciated, as I don't think we would have been able to justify ordering dessert since we were so full, and it did top off the meal. We will definitely be back again once we save up for the occasion.
July 9, 2009|Our server, Chris H. something,|5|Our server, Chris H. something, was unbelievable. He was so kind and so helpful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for an excellent meal in Providence. I spent approximately three weeks eating out every night and The Capital Grille is certainly the best bite in all of RI as far as I can tell. I would surely come back again. Although it was certainly pricey, it was well worth it. Overall, I was truly content with my experience at The Capital Grille - Providence.

July 3, 2009|This was the first time I|4|This was the first time I went to Capital Grille in Providence and didn't like something. The potatoes au gratin were not tasty. Something, the cheese topping perhaps was burned and was easily tasted. We didn't bring home what wasn't eaten. The waiter was not our favorite and that is okay, but he was not a good substitute either. He was not confident nor attentive. He never offered coffee with the dessert and although the dessert was an anniversary complimentary dessert, it is not what I would have ordered and I would rather pay for the dessert than get something I don't like near as much. So this has been a rather negative review, not the customary all five star review I normally give Capital Grille Providence. I will however return!

February 13, 2009|Service was poor and slow--asked|3|"Service was poor and slow--asked immediately for our drink order (a good thing), then we asked for two minutes to decide, and didn't see the waiter for another 20 minutes. Then took another 15 minutes for the waiter to get the wine from the wine ""closet"" which was 15 feet away from our table. Brought a 2006 wine, sent it back (supposed to be a 2004) and then had to wait another 10 mintues. When he returned, asked for our dinner order. Received appetizers in 10 minutes and entree came before appetizers were cleared. Table was terrible as well--right near the kitchen. Usually the service is very good, but we got service ""with an attitude."""
February 6, 2009|I have eaten at Capital Grill|3|I have eaten at Capital Grill in Boston and Atlanta, and always had excellent meals. I was really lokking forward to Saturday night in Providence. While the service was very good, the food was below par. The salads, Caesar and Wedge were mediocre. The Ceasar was all ribs of romaine and the Wedge was drenched in dressing, and garnished only with bacon, and tomato slices on the side. I ate only half as there was so much dressing it became unappealing. The steaks were quite disappointing. I have had the Kona crusted sirloin and this time it was not only not flavorful but seemed to be a poorer quality beef than I have had at Capital Grills in the past. If this had been my first experience at a Capital Grill, I would not be inclined to return.

January 13, 2009|A very nice dining experience|5|"A very nice dining experience but needs some tweeking. With a reservation, you should not have to wait almost 15 mins. to be seated esp. when there are abundant empty tables. The hostess should take your coat to the coat room and bring you the ticket, She should not state "" There is a complmentary coat closet around the corner"" Since I was weraing a fur, I was not too happy to see that it was unattended when I walked by to use the Ladies' Room. These issues were not commensurate with the great food, excellent service and checking in occasionally by our waiter and mgr.to see if we had needs."
January 13, 2009|The service was excellent.|3|The service was excellent. I found the food to be good but definately overpriced.

The experience was all that we expected from The Capital Grille. Thank you, Gail James

The original table we were to be seated at was wedged between a booth and another table and if we had sat there we would have had the waiter's backs/butts in our faces all evening.

Ronny, our server, gave the best service I have ever received in my life! He was friendly and attentive while also being very down to earth.

He also brought us a complimentary piece of cake at the end of our meal. That was a very nice touch. We have a a special wine that we enjoy from their wine list (Rex Hill Pinot Noir - Jacob Hart Vinayard), which was out of stock, but he made a nice recommendation for a wine just above and just below it in price, as well as presenting the benefits of each.

Then after finishing our dinners, we were asked to move again since they had a party of 16 coming in. Knowing that they were very crowded due to the commencement we agreed. We were moved to a booth and were compensated with dessert and coffee. A little unsettling, but all in all, a very nice experience. Excellent food.

My husband had the porterhouse steak, and I had the filet. THE three sides we chose were fresh asparagus/ hollandaise, au gratin potatoes, and sauteeded medly of mushrooms. NO salads, no soups were needed. The wine was excellent. THE waitstaff knows their business as to the entree choices as well as wine pairings. When my filet came to me a bit too over cooked for medium rare, it was whisked away. TO my surprise,Waiter Ron and the CHEF both returned with a perfectly done filet. THE chef told me he cooked it for a shorter length of time, and at Capital Grille, they aim to please. Well, please they did. Perfect! We will return
May 10, 2008|We arrived for our reservation|4|We arrived for our reservation and had to wait about 10 mins....not bad. The part that was not ok was they wanted to seat us at a table that was clearly too small for a party of 6. There was not enough room on that table for a bread basket in addition to the 6 dinner plates. We insisted on a larger table for which we had to wait 30 minutes more. Once we were seated, our service was superb and they went out of their way to make up for the poor beginning.

Of course my husband's Filet and stuffed shrimp was as good as always and the key lime pie (with pistachios) is to die for! Definitely a satisfying night out!!
