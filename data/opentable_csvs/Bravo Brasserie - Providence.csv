ays ago|Great eats.|5|Very good service and the food was top notch. A little tight in seating but acceptable. The only downside is the level of noise in the room. But some like it that way so long as you know about it beforehand. Food was well prepared and requested and quite tasty.

February 18, 2016|Noise level was very loud!  Food excellant|4|Excellant food, pleasant and efficient staff - but difficult to talk over the noise! We still go there often!!
February 16, 2016|Great Spot!|5|Terrific spot for pre or post show dinner and cocktails. Food was excellent with nice portion size and service was quick.
February 14, 2016|Perfect Valentines' Day|5|My partner and I attended the 50th Anniversary Star Trek concert tour at PPAC on Valentines' Day 2016. As part of the evening, I had reserved a table at Bravo because of it's proximity to PPAC and promise of free valet parking (essential in the city, I think). We walked to and from and I have to say I was not disappointed. The food was absolutely delicious, from the cheese plate all the way to the entrees, and though we didn't consume any wine, the list they supplied was impressive. Prices were expensive but not outrageous given the fare that was offered. My partner had the duck a'laronge and it was succulent; I opted for the salmon and received a hearty portion, and the server didn't mind substituting the starch for another vegetable, which was much appreciated. I wish I could remember the host and server's names but I'm terrible with names; they were both very polite and friendly, and made the evening absolutely perfect. We will absolutely visit Bravo again next time we are in the city.
February 14, 2016|It'a Ok|3|This restaurant was just ok....food was ok but nothing to write home about - it was edible - service had to be told to slow down - got the feeling they wanted us in an out quickly - but not to give you wrong impression - staff was pleasant - would probably give them another try if ever in Providence again

February 6, 2016|convenient stop when you're going to Trinity Rep|5|I called to say I was running about 15 minutes late and they were wonderful. They still accommodated us with my requested corner table after about a 20 minute wait. And they were apologetic for making us wait. I had assumed since I was late we would have just had to take a seat wherever available since the place was slammed! Between the play and I believe a PC game at the Dunk every table and barstool was occupied. My only comment regarding the food would be that the lobster club was not as chuck full of lobster meat as I would've liked so I think the next time I'd order something else, but other than that it is definitely a restaurant I would return to and one I'd recommend to others.

January 30, 2016|Great after a show!|4|We came in after seeing Cabaret at the PPAC for dinner. Food and service was excellent as usual...love this place!
January 27, 2016|EXCELLENT SERVICE AND FOOD|5|There were nine of on a Saturday night before a show in Providence. Everyone was very pleased with their choice of entree. The server was very efficient and pleasant. Would definitely go back.
January 26, 2016|Love this restaurant|5|Have eaten here a couple of times prior to my last experience and loved the food and service. I had a reservation a coupled of days ago prior to a show at PPAC and ran late due to traffic and a missed exit. Called from the road and they were wonderfull and accommodating knowing I'd be pressed for time to make the show on time. Got to the restaurant an hour before showtime, the food was great and they were great to get us in and out quickly in time for our show. I will always go back to Bravo Brassserie before a show in Providence!
January 22, 2016|Very average|2|Good was very average. I could have made better. Service was very slow. Didn't seem to be the servers faults but the cooks. There was times where all the servers where in the kitchen waiting on food. The table next to us waited almost 20 minutes for their desserts and they came out wrong. We waited close to 10 minutes for a side salad that should have only taken a couple minutes. I work in the food industry and I have ever seen a restaurant that when I look around I see everyone looking for a server and not one was on the floor.
January 22, 2016|Prov Restaurant Week ....|4|"We visited Bravo during restaurant week for their great 2 for 1 deal for $35. The choices were ample and with drinks and tip it came to roughly $70 per couple. The winner entree of the night was the 14oz bone on Pork chop. While I had the chicken with crabmeat and asparagus, I was drooling for the 2"" thick pork chop that 2 others had ordered. Nice and seared on the outside and moist as can be on the inside covered in a spicy chutney sauce. The meal came with salad, entree, and dessert for two people...a bargain in the City. We will be sure to return, especially during restaurant week."
January 15, 2016|Good Food|4|Food was a great value for the money-(Providence Rest Week). Waiter seemed somewhat removed from the waiter process.
January 15, 2016|Restaurant Week|4|Having gone to Bravo before, it was a no brainer to head there for Providence Restaurant week. My boyfriend and I arrived with another couple. The service was excellent, as were the options on the restaurant week menu. The problem was with the salmon. Myself and the other female diner with us both ordered the salmon. Our waitress did not ask us how we wanted it cooked, and the salmon was very overdone. It was dried out and tough to eat. The rest of the meal was delicious, but I wouldn't recommend ordering salmon. Also, our waitress never asked us how our food was, so we were unable to give a true review while still in the restaurant.
January 11, 2016|Love this place!!|5|We came to bravo for dinner to remember our dear friend who passed away a year ago. What a wonderful experience. I think bravo will become our annual spot to honor her. The food was delicious, drinks were great and service was A+. thanks so much
January 2, 2016|The food and service are always great. D...|4|The food and service are always great. Down stairs is noisier than I like but upstairs is much quieter. Unfortunately I was not impressed with the 1/2 bottle of Chianti I bought this time. Otherwise all was very nice. We eat here regularly before going to the theater.
January 2, 2016|Pre-and post-show gem|4|I found Bravo last year when I took my family to the Nutcracker. It is festive and friendly and we all love the food. So this year for a show at the Trinity Rep we returned. Still love it - and its free valet parking - and came for a good dinner beforehand as well as post-Heidi-Chronicles discussion. Everything about it is enjoyable and good with the major exception of service. Both visits the servers have been middle-to-low energy and attentiveness. I don't need a waiter to be all over us, but come back and see if we need something! This was especially bad upstairs (for dinner). Downstairs after the show (which is louder but more festive) was better.
December 31, 2015|Went for New Year's Eve. Was disappointe...|4|"Went for New Year's Eve. Was disappointed to learn when we sat that there was a limited menu. I had called before making the reservation via Open Table and SPECIFICALLY ASKED if there would be a limited menu and was told no. I made the reservation and planned to have one of the delicious burgers. Sat down with the menu, not a burger to be found. Was mostly seafood, which neither of us eat. The only option was to either leave or both have the one chicken option, which while very good was both over my intended budget and not what we went there for. Again, food was good. Told the waitress that I had called and asked and been given wrong info, she said ""sorry, not sure who you spoke to"" and walked away. Outside that the service was also fine, I understand there was probably nothing she could do. It's just frustrating to have called and asked two months in advance because we love the burgers, knowing sometimes menus are limited, be told there would be a full menu and arrive to fine the thing you were planning on for dinner not on the menu. We will be back for the burgers some other night."
December 20, 2015|Bad service and bad food points to Bad Management|1|I work and live near Bravo, a customer since opening. Food has been mostly HIT sometimes MISS. At my suggestion we came as party of 4. 2 other tables were occupied with 3 and 2 people, respectively. When drinks arrived, one was oddly placed on the edge of the corner of the table partially atop the dinner napkin so it was tilted outward. Had I not noticed it immediately, it would have been elbowed off the table. This was a sign of things to come. A hot loaf of french-type white bread was served with butter. With only 2 bread plates for the 4 of us, one used the service plate that the butter crock came on, and I used a dinner napkin to catch the crumbs. My food arrived lukewarm. I could not get the waitperson's attention to ask to reheat it so I started cutting into my Filet Mignon which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. My first bite met with a stringy chew. 2nd bite OK. 3rd bite, you're out. I ate some lukewarm potatoes and decided to wait until dessert to sate my appetite. Another's steak, ordered medium, was overcooked even by well done standards, to the point that it had a deep gray interior totally devoid of any moisture. The roll that came with a burger was grilled nicely but stale. Time for dessert! Apple CRISP, described on the menu as their house made recipe, was served in a generic onion soup bowl filled with a molten mush of sweet oatmeal and spices with IQF apple slices. Apparently, house made does not mean homemade. Not a single crispy crumb at all. This dessert should be warm but it scalded the roof of my mouth. I wish my food would have been as hot. During this minor fiasco, the waitperson had to be flagged down twice to ask for silverware. An after dinner drink order was forgotten and then placed in front of us after the check was paid as we were getting up to leave. I started to look for the hidden camera. A generous tip was left in spite of the awful service as it was the season of giving. There was no excuse for this on a very slow Sunday.
December 16, 2015|What a dissapointment.|1|What a dissapointment.
December 12, 2015|Second Time|5|Food and service was great. Had the same waitress for the second time in a month and she was great. Valet parking is a plus
December 12, 2015|Good Place to Eat before Trinity|3|Bravo is a solid restaurant. I had the chicken sandwich - very filling with great french fries. My friend had the steak sandwich - cooked perfectly and tender. Everyone in Bravo was having a great time...and we were there at 5PM.

Server was not very attentive he seemed to be distracted, with that being said I would recommend going the food and views were fabulous.

November 26, 2015|Happy Thanksgiving!|5|We ate at Bravo on Thanksgiving with a party of 6. Our party was traveling from different locations and did not arrive at once. The service was very welcoming, and sat us before our whole party arrived. We got the cheese plate and the Bravo mussels, and the wonderful hot bread while we waited. The mussels were amazing, and every drop of sauce was sopped up with bread. The place was full of families and other large parties but the service was prompt and the food was great. we were evenly split on the entree, with 3 having the turkey special, one had duck, and two salads. WE all enjoyed our meals and the whole experience.
November 22, 2015|Great pre-theatre brunch|5|Great find for a Sunday brunch before the theatre. Server was attentive and food was great.
November 21, 2015|a bit disappointed|4|Had reservations at 7:00p and table wasn't ready. Sat us down at 7:30p. I feel they could have compensated us in some way. Which they did not. Especially when all week long I kept getting emails from them reminding me of the reservation and telling me to notify them immediately if there was any change in the reservation. A bit disappointed.
November 15, 2015|Can't wait to go back.|5|Great spot, great food,great drinks and great server. What else can I say. Love it.
November 15, 2015|Great Seafood|5|We got the seafood tower. It was fresh and the presentation was great.

October 25, 2015|Enjoyed Bravo|5|The staff was pleasant and the food was very good. Close proximity to PPAC.

October 24, 2015|Great Place|5|We came here for dinner before a show at PPAC. Food was great, service was great and atmosphere was great. We will definitely be back.
October 17, 2015|Noisy|2|We were here early on a Saturday night before the theater. It was so jam packed that they had to keep moving tables around so people could get in and out of their tables. In addition, it was extremely loud - so noisy that we couldn't hear each other without shouting. The food was mediocre at best. I wouldn't go back.
October 16, 2015|Mixed Bag|3|I recently selected this restaurant based on reading the reviews. In general the food was good. Both my husband and daughter loved their meals. I however was very disappointed in my meal. I ordered beef tenderloin medium not rare. In addition, I thought the food prices were very high.
October 16, 2015|Excellent place to go!|3|"This was our first trip to Bravo, as we had an event at the PPAC. loved that we could valet there until after the event, big plus. Food was fantastic, drinks were good and the service was superb. My only complaint was the noise level. It was so loud my husband and I had to keep saying ""what"" to each other! We'll probably try this place again for lunch to see if the noise level is less because we absolutely loved the seafood sampler! We got one as an app before our meals, then again we came back after the show for another cocktail and the sampler dish!"
Dined on October 4, 2015|A view from the bar|4|"I love the eclectic and electric vibe of Bravo. Living in the city of Providence, I have made this ""my bar."" The food is always good, the service is fantastic, and most often, the crowd reflects the demographics of this city I love."
September 26, 2015|GO!|5|The food is the best. Been there twice now and both times have been amazing. Can't wait to go again!
September 19, 2015|Who's to blame here.|2|"We were taken to a 24"" table in the bar area. Were told we should have requested a table in the dining room when reserving thru Open Table. Extremely uncomfortable and crowded. We had to place our water glasses and bottle of wine on a ledge to make room for our dinners. Would be fine for a sandwich but not a $90 dinner. So much for a lovely beginning to a rare night out in Providence. Made these reservations quite early as well."

We were running late because of traffic, so I had to call to them we'd be late. They were great, held the table. Just a nice, friendly, place with good food and pleasant atmosphere.
September 11, 2015|A delightful find!|5|Two couples decided to dine prior to an evening music event, and were looking for a casual and comfortable setting with great food and an excellent wine list. We were delighted with our choice of Bravo. The atmosphere was perfect, service top notch, and the food, although not consistently excellent between the four of us, was very good indeed! My husband raved about the calamari, although I was not as enamored. The steak frites was greatly enjoyed, the sweet potato fries are exceptional. Turkey burger just okay. We are eager to try other options on the menu and will be back.
September 2, 2015|Exceptional and Elegant|5|"Well, I think the entire Bravo menu is great. So many excellent choices for appetizers, entrees, and dessert. I particularly appreciate the Carpaccio which I do not find on many menus. I had the duck and not only was it crispy and delicious, the portion was very generous! Maybe because it was a week night, it was very quiet; and I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere especially since I was having dinner with two special friends and wanted the time to be a time of sharing. My ""before dinner cocktail"" was a Negroni. It was excellent! That drink is not always made correctly. I really enjoyed the Bravo Negroni!"
September 2, 2015|Very good food|4|Went to dinner with two friends and had a very good meal. The restaurant wasn't very busy but it was a little on the noisy side.
August 29, 2015|What a great staff!!|5|We recently had a dinner during Waterfire for a group of 24!! Upon entering a very handsome gentleman greeted us (to the delight of the girls in our party:)). He was very professional and seated everyone comfortably without my assistance. We had a 34 passenger bus and the manager, Gabriel gave up his parking space so that we can park off the road and close to the restaurant. Gabriel came out and made sure we were safe and when we told him we had a flat tire he even checked it for us!! How can we tell everyone what a great server Kristen was? She was an unbelievable server!! Imagine 24 elderly residents ordering off the menu all asking questions at the same time (and only hearing half of what is said). Kristen not only got all the orders correct, she served, bussed and even gave each of them individual checks!! But of course this was not the end of the unbelievable service. When we had finished eating, Gabriel told our driver to drop off our group at Waterfire and he would hold the parking spot till we returned so that we didn't have to search for a spot... This was the BEST SERVICE we have EVER gotten anywhere. Thank you Bravo or should I say Bravo, Bravo :)
August 21, 2015|Classic space, great service, food okay|4|Went for an early dinner as this was the only place in the area with reservations prior to 5:00. Very nice inside with French-style tile floor, wood walls and banquette/chair seating. We were the only patrons eating dinner at 4:30 (!) and server made us comfortable and happy. He was perfectly attentive and just wonderful on all levels. We had the cheese platter to start. The cheese was not especially fresh and the plate was padded with overly large heaps of dried cranberries and apricots - kind of silly...but the walnut butter was divine! My daughter had rare steak frites and was very happy. I had the asparagus ravioli which were floating in a deep sea of broth and veg. Not especially flavorful, just okay. Nice experience, but the food on our visit was sub-par overall.
July 2, 2015|Steak?|3|Not a busy night,. Service was friendly and prompt. I got Steak frites. Very dis appointing. The steak had no flavor and was rubbery. It also had the taste of the fish that I smelled cooking on the grill when we walked in. I probably won't return here.
June 14, 2015|sloooow service|2|I want to love this place. I adore French bistro atmosphere and the location across from Trinity is ideal. We came in for late lunch. Place was pretty empty but two wait staff on duty plus bartender and hostess. Service was agonizingly slow. Waited for order, waited for drinks, etc. unacceptable given the number of staff versus diners. Food was ok not great. Would not return. Had similar experience year ago when we stopped by for a late dinner. No service standards. Save aggravation and go to Red Stripe or Pot au Feu if you are craving authentic French atmosphere with service.
June 12, 2015|IF YOU DON'T MIND NOISE....|3|food overall is very good; salads great; veal was NOT tender; waitress very friendly, attentive and efficient; biggest complaint is the NOISE. It was a pre-theater night, so very crowded.
June 10, 2015|Great, yet again...|5|This is our third trip to Bravo and certainly won't be our last! We started with the seafood sampler, a selection of shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, sesame crusted tuna and bacon wrapped scallops. The tuna was perfectly cooked as were the scallops-delicious. I had the evening special-blackened tuna. A huge steak, perfectly medium, with a nice pineapple sauce over the top. Just spicy/sweet enough, and I loved the garlic spinach and the sweet potato mash which accompanied it. My boyfriend had the veal Milanese and raved about it and the roasted potatoes and crisp green beans. Along with their delicious fresh, warm baguettes and lovely cocktails, this was yet another delightful experience. I love this place!
June 7, 2015|My husband & I were visiting Providence ...|4|My husband & I were visiting Providence for his birthday. We dined here for Sunday brunch. We arrived about 10 minutes prior to our reservation & realized the restaurant wasn't open yet. We were waiting outside & the friendliest girl came out with menus, allowed us to take out pick of tables (we wanted to sit outside) & took our drink order. As soon as the kitchen opened she took our food order. The food was delicious (I had the French toast, a must order!), the drinks were great but the best part was the service. I would definitely recommend for an inexpensive brunch location.
June 5, 2015|Good Spot!|5|We went here for our anniversary dinner and then to trinity rep. VERY Convenient. We came back after the show for a follow up drink and dessert and sat at the bar. The dining room seating was a tad uncomfortable; that is probably the only criticism I have (more comfy seats). Aside from that, the staff was great, the location perfect, valet service excellent, and the food was delicious. Pricing was fine as well.
May 10, 2015|Bustling, pricey, tasty|4|Solid upscale pub food -- sandwiches, burgers, salads, pizzas etc -- at definitely upscale prices. The spinach/goat cheese/pancetta pizza was delicious. Lobster roll very satisfying. Pastrami sandwich meat was tough. It was overall tasty, but kind of overpriced for Providence. Extremely noisy. I do not care for restaurants where you have to shout to talk to your table companions. Service was largely attentive and friendly. If you're OK with the deficits, it's a fine restaurant. It couldn't be more convenient to Trinity Rep. Literally across the street. It was Mothers' Day, so perhaps our experience wasn't entirely typical
May 9, 2015|Good eating in Providence|4|Our party of four enjoyed four different entrees and shared a salad (too large for one). The decor on close inspection is dated and but still evokes the intended neighborhood brasserie feel. Short walk to the Performing Arts Center and Lupo's for people looking for a pre-show dinner option.
May 3, 2015|Grwar Find!|4|Our large group was ravenous after eight of them had just finished running the Providence Rhode Races......our waitress was very efficient and friendly. The food was delish and had a lots of choices for a hungry crowd!
May 2, 2015|Always constantly good.|4|We go to Bravo frequently when we are going to theater. The food is always good, the menu has something for everyone and they are great about getting you out in time for theater, which is across the street, so the location is perfect. Just allow enough time for your meal. This most recent time, we actually went back for an drink and dessert. It was a great evening.
May 1, 2015|new place for us|5|Bravo has been in place for 10+ years- this was my first time there -- i will be back soon Wonderful staff -created an enjoyable experience. The food was OUTSTANDING. Bourbon list was diverse. I had the asparagus ravioli -- very different presentation ( no red sauce) at the suggested of the waiter I added ship - great idea - the dish was superb. My husband had the pan seared scallops- he said they were very good! We shared the appetizer ( smoked salmon) Portions are large- come hungry!
April 22, 2015|Good food, great staff|4|First time there, great location and look forward to being there this summer!
April 21, 2015|Yummy|5|I've dined here on several occasions with a small group as well as a couple. The food has consistently been good. We have our favorite go to meals but also enjoy the specials from time to time....will keep coming back!
April 18, 2015|WE love this place! Great food and super...|5|WE love this place! Great food and super friendly service! also Valet parking- very important in Providence at night.
April 12, 2015|First visit-we will be back!!|5|Went here for dinner before a show at the PPAC. We had the cheese plate as an app; nice variety of cheeses and a perfect size for two. Their specialty martinis were delicious and they had a nice selection of wines as well. My boyfriend had the half duck-it was tender, with perfectly crispy skin and came with pan roasted potatoes and green beans. I had the special-an absolutely delicious spinach and mushroom ratatouille over ravioli with grilled chicken and a scrumptious marinara. We split a tiramisu for dessert...as we were almost too full-but enjoyed every bite of the coffee soaked ladyfingers and delicious creamy filling. A great meal overall-we will be making the hour long trip frequently, I think!
March 28, 2015|Good spot for pre-theater dining.|4|Although the seafood casserole (a special that night) was not as described by our server, it was delicious, as we're the other three meals at our table, including a very good creme brulee. The food was definitely the highlight of the evening! What we didn't like...noise level was very high, and tables were very close to neighboring diners. Also, wine list was adequate, but included some very low end wines (Rex Goliath...3 bottles for $10 at the liquor store). Should kick the offerings up just a little.
March 8, 2015|Closeness|4|The food, service was excellent The only draw back is that you felt like you were sitting on top of the guest next to you. Other than that highly recommended.
February 7, 2015|Perfect dinner before the theatre|5|We went to Bravo before a performance at the Trinity theater which is right across the street. The wine list was extensive, the food was delicious and the restaurant was beautiful. It was a little loud, but most restaurants nowadays are.
February 4, 2015|always a good experience|5|I always have dinner here before going to Trinity and other times as well. Food is always great. I think I have had just about everything on the menu and would order them all again. The service is terrific. Valet parking is convenient. Great place for 2 or 8 or more.
January 23, 2015|Restaurant Week 2015|3|Bravo Brasserie had a decent menu for Restaurant Week. I ordered salmon, which was great. My husband ordered steak frites, which ended up being a tough, undercooked piece of meat with fried onions on top - no fries. The server was fine, but he was only able to take one request at a time (e.g. took water orders, went off to get our waters, then took our wine order, then walked off to get our wine, meanwhile we were ready to order from the beginning). The server also argued with me and told me that all the Oregon wines were half bottles, meanwhile there were an entire section on half bottle wines. We'd give the restaurant another try in the future, during non-restaurant week, to see if we find the same flaws.
January 9, 2015|Excellent|4|Food was excellent. However the clam chowder had a lot to be desired. I have had much better, there was something in there I just couldn't pinpoint what it was. Service was good.
December 30, 2014|Great Pre-Theatre food!!|4|12/30/14 We had a great meal here before seeing the Christmas Carol at Trinity: Seafood sampler for an app was a nice mix of shrimp, scallops, crab cake and fresh tuna. Our entrees were the steak frites : steak was more like a tender filet and the salmon which was fresh :) The desserts: carrot cake and creme brulee were a perfect ending to a great meal. Btw, the service was great as well!
December 13, 2014|Our family enjoyed Bravo Brasserie!|4|"We chose Bravo because it's right across the street from Trinity Rep, where we were going after dinner. We truly enjoyed our meal there - the ambiance is wonderful, reminded us of places we've eaten in Italy. The food was excellent, nicely prepared and there was plenty of it, but not too much. My only ""complaint"" would be that we were seated next to a party of 14 and across from a party of 8 or so, and it got very noisy at times. We certainly could have asked for another table, but didn't. We were upstairs, and there is a large window overlooking the street. That was a great touch. All in all, we would most definitely go there again and would recommend it to our friends."
December 11, 2014|A  Wonderful Find|5|My friends and I were going to the PPAC Thursday night and we were looking for something different! We found it at Bravo Brasserie, especially since we were seated in their upstairs dining area! What a great view, decorations were just enough. The service was wonderful, as well as the Martinis we all ordered! Since the five of us, all ordered burgers, we couldn't really rave about the food, or complain! We did enjoy our experience here, and will be back! Thank you, also for seating us immediately!
December 8, 2014|I've eaten here a few times and always h...|3|I've eaten here a few times and always had a great experience, it was a slow night, food was good, however our waitress was a little rude.
November 28, 2014|Perfect balance!|5|We had a wonderful experience. Our server, Maureen, was perfectly attentive. The food was excellent- we loved the beet salad. Family couldn't stop talking about the mussels! Will be back!
November 27, 2014|Very nice Thanksgiving dinner|4|We had a very nice Thanksgiving dinner. The food was great and the service was excellent. The dining area is small and the tables are crowded pretty close together, so take that into consideration.
November 26, 2014|Just ok is not ok|3|Have enjoyed Bravo in the past and it is close to Trinity Rep theatre but this time food was very blah and bland. Bread was good, lobster mac&cheese was good. Cod dish was not very good....broth was strange. Pasta in pink vodka sauce w/shrimp was just ok as sauce was blah/bland. Surf and turf combo of scallop and steak was also just ok....scallops is bread crumb were bland (again that word!) and steak was fine but a strange cut....more of a mound of steak standing up on the plate. Service and ambience were fine but food dragged down the score. Wine wasn't great either but I guess that was our choice.
November 21, 2014|Great Find!|5|"Found Bravo on Open Table and decided to check it out. What a great decision! Food was great and the service outstanding. Tables are very close, so forget any intimate conversation, but the couple next to us were very friendly and fun to dine ""with"". The saffron mussels are a must! Beyond delicious especially with the fresh baked bread!"
November 21, 2014|Great dinner before the theater|5|We were greeted at the door with a smile, and shown to our table immediately. Our server was very attentive and brought us deliciousl, warm bread and butter, while reviewing the menu, Our starter course of mussels dijon was outstanding and plentiful! A couple that sat next to us was so impressed by the aroma of our dish, that they ordered the same thing!!! My beet salad was really good and perfect for me. My husband enjoyed a sauteed veal cutlet entree. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of a fine pinot noir, and were off to the theater in plenty of time!!
Dined on November 15, 2014|Bad Night|3|One of my favorite places to eat after shopping in Providence however last Saturday night our server was terrible which unfortunately made our experience well below the usual great time. Our meals were good but due to again to our server they were not prepared as ordered. Lack of attention was our greatest complaint, messing up the order was our our second and forgetting to tell us about the nights specials was also a mistake as we were looking for something different from the main menu, I discussed the situation with the reception person and he took my name and information stating the manager would be calling which never happen so once again another misstep. Maybe there is a new management team here if so they are off to a bad start!!
November 15, 2014|Pre-theater dining|4|Right across from Trinity Rep, so very convenient for that or PPAC. Service is good and reasonably fast. Prices are reasonable and the food is very good. I highly recommend the Mussels.
November 9, 2014|Another great meal|5|We have eaten here before and again another great meal. We love to eat here when we go to the theatre. Free valet parking during dinner and theatre, you can't beat that. Bravo will even hold your leftovers for you and have them ready when you come back from your show. Great service, nice Riesling. We had 5:00 reservation and we were early for the 6:30 show and we even had dessert - crème brule and the carmel cake !! At other restaurants, we are usually rushing. The Mac and Cheese is huge. Chicken Oscar is also great.
September 24, 2014|always good|5|been a happy customer for years. On my visiting family's list of restaurants to make time for.. could use some new entrees for us regulars to try.
September 20, 2014|Not Bad|3|Nothing bad about this restaurant, but nothing exceptional either. Very large menu which went from $9.95 salad and burgers to $30+ entrees. That feature really worked for our mixed group, 14 years of age to 50+.
September 20, 2014|Great place to dine and relax|4|We randomly found the restaurant on the Open Table listing when the other restaurant that was recommended was no longer in business. What a delight surprise when we had never visited any restaurant in Providence! Great place to meet up and dined with a group of friends The food was delicious and met up the review we saw on line. Our waitress was wonderful and attentive. Our group just loved the place and will definitely go back to visit.
September 12, 2014|Great|4|Lots of options for food and cocktails. Great outdoor patio that we got to enjoy a birthday dinner with our dogs.
September 6, 2014|I love this restaurant!|4|My husband and I travel into Providence between 6-8 times every year for shows or a restful weekend away. We eat at Bravo Brasserie everytime, sometimes twice during our stay. The atmospher is casual and relaxed. The cuisine is french inspired and absolutely delicious. The wine list never disappoints. Our 21 year old daughter and her boyfriend have also become big fans and on a recent stay dined with you and raved about the food. My personal favorites include the lamb, any of the fish dishes, and the Penne ala Vodka. My only comment is that it can be very tight quarters when the restaurant is full. But that doesn't discourage us from showing up every time.
August 23, 2014|Good Dinner Option Near the Hilton|4|High ceilings, dark wood and tile mosaics on the floor give the interior a pleasant ambiance. Service was friendly and welcoming. We arrived early and were seated immediately. The menu has a wide variety of appetizers, entrees and dinner salads which makes it a good choice for larger groups because everyone can find options to suit their taste. Nice selection of affordable wines. The steak au poive got rave reviews from two in our party. The duck and dinner salads (Nicoise and frisee) were also very good. The only entree that got a so-so review was the lamb chops.
August 9, 2014|Did they hire new cooks??|4|"I love this place, always end up there for a last minute nice evening out. Unfortunately, something went ary in the kitchen. Over-cooked filet, over-cooked tuna, the bread although warm seemed day old and reheated. ""Grilled asparagus"" no char marks at all, seemed they were heated in the microwave--Did they fire the old kitchen staff? Or is the chef not paying attention and people are slacking? Either way, someone Please pay attention before it gets any worse. I'd still suggest this place to people, only because its never been like that in the past, I hope it was a fluke..."
July 26, 2014|Everyone ordered a different salad with ...|5|Everyone ordered a different salad with added protein as an entree. They all looked, tasted delicious and were very satisfying. Very happy with the service and staff from valet greeting to exit.
July 12, 2014|We'll be back|5|Great food at a reasonable price. Bravo Mussels and Linguine and White Clam Sauce were big hits! Grouper special was fresh and flaky. Service was good, and we had a very enjoyable meal.
July 10, 2014|1st timer|3|my 1st time here but my bf have been here in the past and we both agree it's good food but not wow amazing that we would go there on a regular basis. i wanted to try this place out because it's restaurant week and good date night. the service from our waitress is superb and we both love the hot fresh baguette.
June 25, 2014|Good salads|4|The salads are very good. The poached pear salad was my favorite -- great flavors and textures. The salade nicoise was good but not great. My dining partner thoroughly enjoyed the beet salad -- said it was a treat. Service was attentive and quick -- much appreciated, as I was attending a conference and had limited time for my meals.
June 25, 2014|Lobster roll|2|was LOADED with mayo and not much lobster...was very disappointing
June 24, 2014|It's been better...|2|We were sadly disappointed on this Tuesday night when we ate at Bravo's. Usually the food is very good and this has been my husband's favorite NE Clam Chowder in RI. But, this night, it was not as good as in the past. Not only did the soup not live up to it's usual goodness, but also my beet salad was a bit flat and the Beef Bourguignon app had tough hunks of beef. The warm French bagette was still up to it's usual loveliness. I hope it was just an off night because we hate the idea of having to find a new place.
June 22, 2014|Trinity Group|5|We have been having pre-theater dinners at Bravo Brasserie for several years. Obviously, we LOVE it. The food is always wonderful and creative, the wines are lovely and the service is excellent. Couple that with free valet parking and being directly across the street from the theater and we've found perfection. Our group of 6 (occasionally 8) has never been late to a performance, had to walk a long distance for our cars in inclimate weather or paid for garage parking. We've occasionally gone to other area restaurants but feel most at home at Bravo.
June 21, 2014|Busy night outside ...|5|But quiet on the inside. I made a reservation here not realizing it was the same night as the RI Pride parade. Oops! Traffic and parking was difficult in downtown, but once we got to the restaurant, it was quiet inside while all the excitement of the parade was right outside the windows. The food was absolutely excellent, we had the sesame & ginger salmon and pan-seared sea scallops. The shiraz was great and our server was attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend.
June 20, 2014|Good food|4|Food is always good. The salads are great. Enough to share as a first course. Always like the scallops and the salmon. Excellent location for going to Trinity Rep. You can pick up your car from valet parking after the play.
June 20, 2014|Reliable but not exciting|3|We have eaten at this restaurant a few times when going to the theatre. Menu is full of the staple things like burgers, pasta dishes etc. Had the steak sandwich for the first time and I was really tough.
June 18, 2014|Disappointing visit.|2|"After several positive reviews, this is hard to write. Arriving for our Open Table reservation, we were offered a ""choice"" of a high-top in the bar or an outside table (temp in high 80s, main street, evening rush hour). The host stated that all on-line reservations were placed at the end of the reservations list, after phone reservations (and walk-ins) Food - the ""Yellow Fin Tuna Tartar"" ($12.95) was tough, and pieces of cartilage in the mix did not help. The ""Sesame and Ginger Encrusted Salmon"" ($22.95) showed no vestige of either sesame or ginger, although the small piece of fish was well prepared. The ""Nicoise Salad"" ($11.95) was a nice tossed salad, not a composed salad as tradition dictates. Have to put Bravo on ""watch"" list for now."
June 14, 2014|Very disappointed.|2|I really liked bravo about 5 years ago. Now it's dirty and the menu is to big so I'm pretty sure it's not that fresh given how dead it was a a Saturday water fire night. We were never given the specials, pasta were over cooked and the scallops looked as if the seared them in the fryer...... The table was left very messy between courses and we kept having to ask for new flatware.for spending over $450 for 5 people I really would except better service and food.
June 14, 2014|Theater Goodie|5|Across from Trinity Rep, Bravo Brasserie is excellent for a before-theater dinner or after-theater drink or dessert. Many choices on the menu, excellent wine-list, and wonderful desserts.
June 14, 2014|quick lunch|4|great place for lunch before trinity. it is very conveniently located
June 7, 2014|The food is outstanding, and the service...|4|The food is outstanding, and the service is great! The tables are to close to each other, could use more space.
May 27, 2014|Consistenly Good|4|Returning for a visit to our previous home in Providence from our new home in Portland, OR would not be complete without a meal at one of our favorite dining spots, Bravo. We were greeted by our favorite server Maureen who remembered us and even how we preferred our Martini's. This visit was a heartwarming homecoming because of the staff, and a reminder what consistently good food is served. I had the Filet Mignon and my husband had his all-time favorite, Bravo's delicious Lobster Club Sandwich. We will always return to Bravo whenever we visit Providence.
May 15, 2014|Very good & reasonably priced|4|Made last minute reservations for 8:30 after the theater crowd had cleared out. A shared delicious Caesar salad was still a huge portion for each of us. My wife's ½ roasted chicken and my duck a l'orange with a grand Marnier glaze were excellent. The place is large, unpretentious, and had a typical French brasserie menu. They have a solid wine list from which we chose a very flavorful and satisfying Côtes du Rhone. I understand that the pre-theater hour can be elbow to elbow. Timing is everything.
May 11, 2014|Nothing Special|2|We went there on Mother's Day, my husband, mother in law and myself. My husband had prime rib and he said his meal was very good. But my mother in law and myself had the asparagus mushroom ravioli with shrimp and it was disappointing. It came in a broth which was weird. The service was not good. We waited quite a while before the waitress came over. I also noticed everyone had bread on their table but we did not get any. Probably a good thing anyway. Another thing I noticed was they were handing out carnations to all the woman for MD, we did not get one. Not that I really cared but I guess it just irritated me because of the whole experience.
May 11, 2014|Mother 's Day|4|We had our MD brunch /lunch at Bravo 's. Of all the other restaurants I looked at we chose Bravo once again. The menu selection was good and reasonable. The location is convenient for us. Our waitress was wonderful. Thank you!!! Bravo.
May 10, 2014|Great Menu|5|Very enjoyable dining experience before going to the theater. The wait staff was exceptional and the menu had something for everyone. We had a wonderful time.
May 9, 2014|Great night out!|4|Went here before a show at PPAC. Easy walk to the theater. Service was great and the food was delicious! Will definitely go back if I'm in the area again.
May 8, 2014|Just a fair restaurant|2|Since we had tickets for Trinity, we decided to give Bravo another try. We have never been particularly fond of the restaurant, but since they have valet parking and their proximity to the theater is great, we tried it again. The server was good, friendly enough, but was very busy! The food was bland at best. The menu hasn't changed in years, and for that food a bit pricey. We definitely crossed this restaurant off the list. Spend a little more and walk not even a block and to go Gracie's!!!
May 4, 2014|PPAC Dinner|5|We had a wonderful meal with a great atmosphere. We arrived early as the show at PPAC was quicker than we expected, and Bravo was able to accommodate our early arrival and seated us promptly with no issue.
May 3, 2014|Good experience|4|First time here. The steak tips were awesome! Also enjoyed my martini! The tables are a little cramped so that's why I went with 4 stars instead of 5. Overall it was great and I would definitely eat here again!
May 3, 2014|No point making a reservation|1|They obviously don't plan well. The servers were visibly and audibly over- stressed with the crowd. We waited over an hour for our reservation that we made before heading to the pub down the street. Such a disappointment - we were looking forward to trying the food; I read good things.
May 2, 2014|Trinity|3|Party of 5 all agreed Food was good . The service not so much. Our particular server was quite low and non attentive to our table. All agreed will give another try in future. Partnership with Trinity for free parking was a pleasant surprise as was Valet parking
May 1, 2014|Before the theatre|4|Seven os us met before the theater. It was extremely crowded and we had limited time. We got served promptly, our waitress was great and everyone enjoyed their food. Definitely would go again!
April 30, 2014|Nice Night Out|4|This corner spot was a great start to a night at the theater. Everyone was very energetic, welcoming and looking to please. Our Waitress Kristen(?sp) was especially friendly, helpful and accommodating. Great selections for appetizer, dinners and drinks too. My Date ordered the Veal and was not thrilled, but fortunately the portions are so plentiful, she and i both filled up on my steak... Neither had room to try the desserts.. Highly recommend.
April 26, 2014|old favorite|5|Always like to go to Bravo- so easy to park car (well, Gabriel parks the car); have a nice dinner, see the play and head home. Enough variety in the menu to keep us regulars returning. thank you, Gabriel, for taking care of us as well.
April 25, 2014|Great before and after the theater|5|I have dinner at Bravo at least once a month. The food is consistently great and the service is superb. They are happy to accommodate any allergies or changes. The menu doesn't change much but it is very varied and it takes a year for me to order the same meal. From valet parking, to the wait and bar staff they all make you feel like family.
Dined on April 20, 2014|great inner city dining|4|Food was great, service was very good as well. Enjoyed the setting, was expecially pleased that we were able to sit in a group of 4 and talk easily and not have to have a problem conversing. We went on a holiday day, so menu was more limited, but it's also a great place to grab a burger before going to the theatre. Plan on frequenting more often, sometimes forget about it. Liked how the chef was willing to split the salads without it being an issue. Great selection of salads as well.
April 18, 2014|Great dinner before the theater|5|This restaurant is very close to both PPAC and Trinity Rep. Trinity Rep is directly across the street. We've been there twice before going to a PPAC production. The 6-7pm crowd are a lot of theater goers. The staff knows this and orders are taken quickly and delivered quickly. Our salads were very good and the Mussels Bravo were outstanding. My husband had the lamp chop and it was good too. Very reasonable for the two of us with a nice bottle of wine.
April 12, 2014|Convenient toTheater & Shows|1|The atmosphere is energetic -- and the open doors overlooking the cafe area and city scape is very enjoyable. However, the service was beyond disappointing. We were headed to a show and had a little over an hour for dinner. The service was beyond S-L-O-W. We had to ask to place beverage order. We had to stop and ask waiter to place our dinner order. We had to ask the hostess for butter. The waiter never came back to our table -- ever -- without our beckoning for his attention. It appeared that there were no other wait staff to serve the entire restaurant. By the time the food arrived, we had to eat quickly and leave. Getting the bill was another challenge. Food was OK but not worth the price, wait and experience.
April 11, 2014|Good pre-theatre stop, responsive|4|Good pre-theatre stop, responsive staff. Good place to try something new.
April 7, 2014|We felt a bit neglected.|2|"I was the one who chose Bravo, (to meet friends), and I must say I was dissapointed with our experience. In the past I have always loved the food and the atmosphere at Bravo, this time not so much. Our waiter was very odd, we were ignored for quite awhile. When I asked a passing waitress if we could get some water, (before we even knew who our waiter would be), she very directly said, ""your waiter will be with you soon"". He was not with us soon. I had my favorite dish, moles frites, it is always great, this time it lacked flavor and the fries were very dry and rather unappealing. My friends burger was over cooked but the other two meals seemed to be fine. I will not rush to go back unfortunately. This was not a busy evening for Bravo."
March 29, 2014|Great find|5|Really enjoyed this pre-theatre meal. Interesting menu, great service
March 28, 2014|Conventient for Trinity Rep|3|Food and service are acceptable / average. My steak and frittes was fine. My wife's sole was just okay. On another visit I would be tempted to just go with burgers or lighter fare. If you are seeing a show at Trinity they will valet park your car and hold it for you while you have dinner and attend the show. When we came out of Trinity, they already had our car parked out front and ready to go. Service rating bumps up a notch just for that. There was nothing special about the menu that would bring us back UNLESS we were there for another show.
March 27, 2014|My husband had a fabulous|4|My husband had a fabulous steak that was very tender and wonderfully flavorful served with a generous portion of yummy mashed potatoes. I enjoyed the Asparagus Ravioli over radicchio with a nice broth and topped with shrimp. A very unique dish that I really enjoyed. We splurged on desserts and enjoyed the Fried Ice Cream that was tasty but a little over the top with the addition of coconut. Our sweet tooths were happy though! Nice wine selection with many choices for all palates and pocketbooks! Try the Cigar Box Malbec, you won't be sorry!
March 24, 2014|great deal Monday!|5|Food was good. Service was slow. This place has great charm and mondays are a great deal... coming back for sure!
March 24, 2014|Monday 2x1 dinner special|3|Went there for the Monday night dinner special (2x1). Two people get salad each, a entree each with two sides and a bottle of wine to share. The deal is $31.99. Based on my dining partners feedback, the cod and salmon was very good. The pork chop was dry. My steak was good, but I asked for medium rare and it came to the table....between medium and medium well. Still, it was juicy and tasty. Next time, I will ask for my steak to be prepared Rare.
March 20, 2014|Great for Trinity Goers|5|Bravo offers free valet parking for Trinity Square patrons, which is very nice since Trinity is directly across the street. The food was great, portions ample and the service was outstanding. Our waitress was a pure delight.
March 18, 2014|Closet to Trinity Rep|4|The restaurant food was fine. We were headed to Trinity Rep for a play so this was very convenient. We valet parked, had dinner and picked up the car afterwards.
March 14, 2014|"Just ""whelmed"""|4|Although the food has always been great, the service and atmosphere is lacking so it becomes an average place. Wine list is disappointing at best. The restaurant is beautiful but with such narrow aisles and tight spaces it is difficult to enjoy a nice meal.
March 13, 2014|Pre Theater Dinner|4|Having never been to Trinity Rep, and with limited time, wanted a restaurant convenient to the theater. Bravo is right across the street. A Thursday night, steady (probably pre-theater) crowd and a lovely, friendly waitress began a nice evening. The food, while not inexpensive, was very good with good sized portions. Unbeknownst to me, Bravo offers free valet parking for show goers, as well as a buy one/get one free dessert with show tix! Next time... So, good food, service, location and ambiance.
March 11, 2014|Bravo|4|Bravo is across the street from the Trinity Rep. Theater that we were attending. It was a perfect spot for a pre-play dinner. The server was attentive and inquired if we were going to the theater. The dinner was not rushed but we, and many others there, had ample time to get to our seats. We were impressed with the selection and quality of the food. Great spot.
March 1, 2014|Sat evening dining|4|Great food, prompt service, enjoyed cheese plate, steaks were delicious, cajun pork chops moist and delicious flavors. We would definitely return. Very loud restaurant when full capacity, so if you are looking for quiet dining this would not be the restaurant.
March 1, 2014|Bravo for Bravo|4|We like this restaurant because it is very convenient when we are attending Trinity or PPAC. The menu is fairly broad but not expansive. You can get a hamburger or a good steak. Meals come with a small loaf of bread served warm. The prices run from moderate to expensive. Portions are generous. We had salmon which was outstanding and tuna which was slightly overcooked, but still delicious. The service is always friendly and the waiters are very good about letting you substitute for a side you would prefer over what is on the menu, which we really appreciate. The downstairs is a little crowded and noisy, but fun. When available, the upstairs is a little quieter.
February 26, 2014|Reliably excellent|5|I enjoy everything about this restaurant. The ambiance, menu choices, quality food and service. The place tends to empty out early as the theater goers tend to dine here before their play starts, so it quiets down by 7:45 - 8:00.
February 22, 2014|Mystery Dinner|3|"It's difficult to review this restaurant, since we did not know they were having a ""Mystery Dinner"" starting at 8 pm and our reservations were at 6 pm. Since we told them we were not going to a show/event that evening, we should have been seated downstairs. We tend to dine at a very relaxed pace when we go out and we were still dining when the restaurant had to start setting up the entire second floor room for their Mystery Dinner. Perhaps because they were so busy preparing for a large group of people that were all coming in at the same time, the kitchen was a little off their game, i.e. my half duck consisted of two legs, but no breast and my wife's beef wellington appetizer was well done. Forgivable, but unfortunate."
February 22, 2014|an old favorite|4|Bravo is always a good choice- have been there when time is short- prior to a play- and they do a great job getting the meal timed correctly. I've also been on quiet summer weekends when it is a pleasure to take more time and enjoy the beautiful space and good food. Glad that old favorites remain on menu with some specials to vary the offerings. Special mention for Gabriel who helps make the dining/theater-going experience so pleasant by taking care of parking the car. Thanks, Gabriel- you're the best!
February 22, 2014|Not as good as we had hoped|3|"We wanted to go out to have a really nice meal to a place we had not been to. We looked up many places online and some were too formal, too trendy or too expensive. I had remembered hearing about Bravo Brasserie when it first opened and always wanted to try it. Well, we did- Bravo looks cool inside- it has the vibe of places like Globe or l'Express in Montreal. The service and food was just good- nothing to ""wow"" us at all. The seafood sampler app was okay, room temp and underwhelming. My steak was good but my wife's was dry. The greens in the side salad with the steak frites were not that fresh. We wanted to be impressed and $125 later (2 drinks each, appetizer,2 entrees tax and tip) we felt we could have done much better for that money."
February 16, 2014|Great pre-theater spot|4|A reliably fast and pleasant spot for a dinner before a performance at Trinity Repertory company. It is usually busy, and a bit noisy, before the theater but the service is pleasant and good. A few favorites are the roast duck, sesame tuna and moules et frites.
February 15, 2014|Nice selection of wines by|5|Nice selection of wines by the glass. The seafood sampler was a great appetizer and just enough for two. We enjoyed our main course and would come here again when in Providence.
February 14, 2014|excellent service|4|we were there on valentines before going to the theatre and though busy our server was terriffic, I think her name was Christy but she deserves to be remembered. Y=The food was very good and large portions for a price fixe special. we had the steak au poive with mashed potato, and broccolli. Along with a ceaser salad and creme brulee. All for 31.00. Well worth it.
February 12, 2014|Great location, adult sized drinks|5|Five stars - great location, food and service was excellent. It was sure nice to get an adult sized beverage! Valet parking was also top notch.
February 8, 2014|Convenient for pre-theatre|4|Convenient for pre-theatre dinner - valet parking a major plus!!!
February 8, 2014|I would recommend this restaurant|4|I would recommend this restaurant for its atmosphere, the great food and drinks, and the service. A great place to go before a play either at Trinity or at PPAC. They do not rush you and you feel as though you could stay as long as you want to. I enjoyed the experience very much and would definitely return.
February 4, 2014|This was not as pleasant as|2|"This was not as pleasant as usual. Was told that because I had made the reservations on line and had not requested a ""table"" they were going to seat us at a high top in the bar because that was all that was available.The gentleman who explained this implied I was stupid for not knowing that I had to specifically request a ""table"" when making dining reservations on line.Not all the tables in the dining room were occupied when we entered but I guess they were reserved for people who had not used Open Table.We have used Open Table at this restaurant several times over the past few months and had no problem but he kept emphasizing it was my incorrect use of ""on line"" that was the problem. My 84 year old husband was not happy at a high top."
January 12, 2014|Yummy|5|As a last minute choice we decided to go to Bravo Brasserie before the theater. Outstanding service and food and the best creme brulee I've ever had
January 12, 2014|Enjoyed Bravo with a group|4|Enjoyed Bravo with a group of friends before a show at PPAC. Super convenient, reasonable prices, great food and extensive wine list!
January 11, 2014|Always a pleasure to eat here|4|It's always a pleasure to have the opportunity to eat at Bravo - the food is consistently very good, the ambience very European café - and the portions very generous for the price. Service is efficient but friendly and the location is convenient to both Trinity Rep and PPAC. We have met friends here and also come alone. The atmosphere can be quiet or boisterous but is never too noisy to hear your dining companions. One of our Providence favorites.
January 10, 2014|Great food, great service,|5|Great food, great service, cozy French Brasserie ambience, but more comfortable. Perfect location before a show.
January 8, 2014|We usually go to Bravo on|2|We usually go to Bravo on our way to PC basketball games.Our last experience was disappointing.At the time we dine there are usually few people there, but the restaurant was crowded due to basketball game and a play at PPAC.We had reservations so they did have a table for us but we had to sit upstairs in the function room.Service was extremely slow. We told the waiter we were going to the game.We ordered sandwiches which took about 1/2 hour to come.My husband's hamburger was overcooked and my steak sandwich was tough and gristly it was pretty much inedible.We never saw the waiter until my husband got up to find him to ask for the check.We were late for the game.I hope this was an aberration not change in management as we have enjoyed Bravo.
January 4, 2014|Good option in downtown Providence|3|After a long day and long drive to Providence we needed an option in the downtown area. A quick review of the menu online showed a variety of options from soup and salad to full meals and enough choices for the 2 vegetarians in our group. There was not a large crowd but those there were rather noisy making conversaiton difficult at first but our server was prompt in taking a drink order and bringing a delicious loaf of hot bread and that took the edge off. Our table ordered a range from a huge bowl of clam chowder to very nicely sized pasta dishes and hamburger with crisp thin fies. While we didn't plan on dessert we were glad we took our server's advice to look at the menu and had an excellent carrot cake and variety of fruit sorbets.
December 31, 2013|Great New Years Eve|4|Went to Bravo as part of our PPAC evening with our two daughters. Food was great. Close to the show. Service was pleasant and friendly. Atmosphere was attractive, eclectic and well appointed. It was nice to have the parking assistance.
December 30, 2013|Great special on Mondays...|5|Great special on Mondays... will return... great steak and love the refreshing yummy salad.
December 28, 2013|Pre show dinner|5|We had 4 for dinner with tickets at PPAC. We arrived early for our reservation but were seated immediately which was great. The service was fast and food were excellent and the staff was very friendly. Nice ambience and perfect location.
December 28, 2013|My husbank really enjoyed|3|My husbank really enjoyed his steak frite. It was done as he liked it and he was surprised that it was a whole piece of steak. My son had the sole and thought it was delicious. However, I was very disappointed with my pan seared scallop. The scallops were not seared very well and they were sitting right on top of the mashed potatoes which sat on top of and completely covered the spinach. I don't enjoy the fact that my every mouthful tasted mashed potatoes. If you like mashed potatoes with every bite, this is your dish. Otherwise, choose another entree.
December 28, 2013|Food was good|3|Just had apps and desert. The waiter needs to learn the menue. He gave us the wrong desert and just said I rang in the correct one he was slow in resolving the issue
December 27, 2013|Loved it!|5|This was our first time visiting. We were with a group of four, including my 11 year old daughter. We all loved everything we ordered! The menu had a little something for everyone and the price was right. We have been talking about it all weekend and we can't wait to go back. My daughter who is quite the little foodie thought it was great.
Dined on December 27, 2013|Slow....|3|Service was very slow. They seemed to have one server and one bartender for the entire restaurant on a busy day. One dish had to be sent back because it wasn't correct, then we waited almost 45 minutes after completing our meal to get the check and pay. Lucky we had the time.
December 27, 2013|Good Pre-theater option|4|We ate here before attending a show at Providence Performing Arts. It was a short walk from the parking garage and theater. The menu was good-sized and diverse, and the food well-prepared...good pub food plus salads and small entrees for lunch. a little heavy on the fries...it seemed like they used them to make the plate looked packed, which wasn't really necessary, and made it hard to eat the rest. Also, they had one waitress and one bartender on duty and the place was packed. They did well, but were rushing around a bit too much and that made the meal feel a bit hectic. Do make reservations, though (we did). We saw people get turned away who had limited time to find something else before the 2 and a half hour matinee.
December 21, 2013|Terrific!|5|My husband and I dine at Bravo often. The food is delicious, the drinks are great and the staff is Outstanding! We would highly recommend Bravo!
December 21, 2013|Dinner and trinity rep|4|Bravo is our go to restaurant when taking in a performance at TrinityRep...the food and service is outstanding and location allows a leisurely or quick meal before walking across the street.
December 17, 2013|We really like this restaurant.|3|We really like this restaurant. Unfortunately we went for dinner at 5:30 on Tuesday in order to make a 7:00 basketball game (restaurant not open for lunch and that might have made a difference) and it was freezing cold in the restaurant. We asked our server and she explained that they did not turn the heat up until the restaurant opened at 5. The food, service and ambience at this restaurant are exactly what we are looking for in a casual downtown restaurant but we do not expect to have to wear our coats through dinner which is what we had to do. Even on days that the restaurant does not open until 5, I am sure that there is someone on site early enough to monitor the temperature better.
December 15, 2013|A Pre-Theatre experience|5|A cold winter day; time to get warm all over before going to trinity. Best place to do that is Bravo!! Varied menu for lunch or brunch at 12:30PM. Great service. Just a very, very fine experience..
December 11, 2013|Thanks|4|Went for our anniversary. Requested a drink to be on the table waiting, it was and it just made the night. Nothing fancy just good food. Burgers... Best fries around. Our waitress was phenomenal!!! Dessert was lacking- apple crisp but over all great night.
December 11, 2013|Out of towner pick|4|In Providence for business and picked this place because of its varied menu and reasonable prices. Waitress was pleasant but maybe a listtle overwhelmed by the pre-theater crowd/rush. Seating is close together
December 7, 2013|Birthday Surprise|4|I chose this restaurant for the celebration of my wife's birthday...we were both very pleasantly surprised. They had held a perfect corner table for the two of us and the food and service were also perfect. Great spot and ambiance in Providence.
December 7, 2013|good, but not great|3|Atmosphere is causal elegant., Food was good....most everyone in our party had sandwiches. Sandwiches come w/ chips, fries or salad. My sister asked for salad w/ her sandwich....they brought fries anyway. I asked for chips....they brought fries anyway. Our waiter offered to take our plates away and return w/ the correct sides, but everyone had already been served, so we didn't want to delay our meal. To his credit, he returned a few minutes later w/ the correct sides. My wife had a great frisse salad w/ salmon (she chose wisely). The beef carpaccio app was excellent. The sandwiches were good...no complaints there. Tap beer selection is reasonable, bar is adequately stocked. One app plus drinks & lunch for 7 was $180.
November 29, 2013|Busy, busy place|3|Bravo was VERY busy on my visit. It was Black Friday and both PPAC and Trinity had performances going on. Busy is fine, but it was too crowded as far as the set up of tables. The hostess had to figure out a way to take us to our table. Upon leaving, it was difficult to maneuver our way out of the restaurant without bumping into other patrons. Our server Kelly was very good and the crowding was certainly not her fault as she found it difficult to serve. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant. My only complaint was the crowding.
November 28, 2013|Nice|5|Lovely place for a Thanksgiving dinner. Not too crowded, easy to get a reservation. Great service, and food was served quickly. We will probably be back again next year!
November 28, 2013|Thanksgiving without the hassles|5|Considering this was Thanksgiving, the staff was polite, efficient and very competent. One would hardly know this was a “special” occasion - if it weren’t for the traditional turkey special. We were fortunate to be at a station covered by Kristen, one of our favorite servers, who was as friendly and unflappable as usual, despite the demands the day placed on her. Food was excellent, drinks great, pacing perfect. One of the reasons we try to visit Bravo Brasserie as often as we can.
November 28, 2013|Happy Foodie|4|My first visit to this restaurant was a pleasant experience. I was allowed to be seated at a table before my scheduled reservation, at my request. The Thanksgiving Day meal served on a large plate, tasted as if the meal was prepared by an exceptional cooking staff. The waitstaff was very friendly and professional. Also the baguette de pain that the waitress brought to my table, was a welcomed surprise. I anticipate returning to this restaurant in the future for more of the same gracious service and delish cuisine.
November 23, 2013|Tables weren't set up to allow|4|Tables weren't set up to allow couple to get close during dinner. I was so close to table next to is that the loud obnoxious person next to us made it impossible to hear my date. Food was great.
November 23, 2013|Fantastic dinner spot!|5|We came here for my 27th birthday, and it was a fantastic dinner spot. The food was amazing, and the service couldn't be better. The night starts off with a whole baguette on the table, in a brown paper bag. Very chic and warm touch. We tried the bravo mussels. They were delicious, and had plenty of bread to dip in the sauce. My girlfriend and I both had the steak frites. The fries in this place, are out of this world. It was delicious and hearty, and we both left very satisfied. My friend, who has a gluten allergy, was very happy with their gf turkey burger without the bun, and their plain fries. All in all it was a fantastic night, in a beautiful restaurant!
November 10, 2013|9 of us met for brunch - service|5|9 of us met for brunch - service was prompt and correct with a smile! Always a favorite spot to hang with a small or large group! They were very accomodating!
November 9, 2013|Consistently good..|4|We've been regulars here for a few years. We enjoy a good meal and time to relax. The steak frites is a regular favorite for us as is the pear salad.
November 9, 2013|mediocre at best|2|food was bland - sauce of moules frites had no spices, fries were soggy. crabcakes were all breading. sat us at bar table which was extremely noisy and we were constantly jostled
November 9, 2013|go for a drink|3|Lively atmosphere with friendly service. Affordable wines. The food was a disappointment. The scallops were not seared and served over a mountain of mashed potatoes. Not a good combination although it was recommended as one of their signature dishes. Next time I go on a busy Saturday night I will stick with something simple like a salad.
November 9, 2013|dinner before Elton John concert|5|We drove from Boston for the Elton John concert. We had a 6pm reservation. Due to unexpected heavy traffic we go there at 6:30pm. We called the restaurant at 6pm to let them know we were on the way. The hostess was very understanding and told us not to worry. We were seated as soon as we got there. The service was excellent. Everything came out of the kitchen in a timely manner. The appetizers and the entrees were all very good. The bonus was that valet parking was complimentary. We would definitely go back here if we are in the Providence area again.
October 14, 2013|Great food and atmosphere|4|Food was excellent - pleased with everything from appetizer to salad to dinner, wine, dessert and coffee. Atmosphere was nice - able to have conversation among our party of 6, though the lighting was a bit too low - tough to read the menu. Server should always be scanning his/her section to see if tables need anything. We went several minutes wanting to order something or needed something and had a hard time getting someone's attention. Though we were not in a rush, our dining experience should have taken less time (when dessert and coffee was brought, check should have been at that time as well... Not to be nit-picky, but these little things would have made our dining experience just about perfect. Food and atmosphere were excellent.
September 28, 2013|Great Before The Theatre|4|Make sure you sit upstairs. The food was pretty good although my friends steak was overcooked.
September 21, 2013|Met some friends for dinner,|5|Met some friends for dinner, parking was a breeze. We were a little early for our table so we had a drink at the bar. Great. When our full party was there are table was ready. The staff was excellent we sat for an hour talking before we ordered. The food was good, it was a great night out with friends
September 16, 2013|Monday night deal for two|3|Monday night deal for two (a bottle of wine, 2 entrees, & 2 salads for $32!) was a great value. HUGE portions of food, and tasty. Overall it would have been a spectacular date night, if not for the service. We sat for 15 minutes, waiting for a server to take at least a drink order, and if not for the hostess we'd still be waiting. The server finally arrived and we made him take our whole order. After hastily leaving us with bread (which is warm and quite good) we didn't see him again. We had no bread plates, and our food arrived without any sight of our salads, which the hostess had to retrieve for us. Even checking out took forever and only happened b/c of the hostess. Overall, food was great, service (minus the hostess) was poor.
September 15, 2013|Very good choice|5|I had wonderful service, great food and all around, it was a perfect dining experience.
September 13, 2013|We always go to Bravo before|4|We always go to Bravo before the theater (Trinity or PPAC). The menu offers all different choices for the person who just wants a appetizer or salad to a sandwich or full meal. The service is efficient but not rushed. The best part is the valet parking!
September 5, 2013|Always a great dining experience!|5|I go here regularly since the restaurant is across the street from Trinity Rep in downtown Providence. The atmosphere is lively, the menu features bistro food with a gourmet flair. The food is delicious with freshest ingredients prepared with flair. I had their sea scollops in tarragon cream sauce over mashed potatoes and fresh spinach! MMMMMM!!!
August 30, 2013|Tasty food generous portions|4|A varied menu with many good choices. Food was well seasoned and presented attractively. Service was attentive and timed well. Would definitely return! A good place to eat in a relaxed environment witthout noise.
August 26, 2013|mussels|4|I really enjoyed reading all of those mussels that we ordered
August 24, 2013|Solid!|4|"This is a great location for a special meal with loved ones, group dinner with friends in a relaxed atmosphere and a place to enjoy french inspired food. I enjoy the food, it is typically pretty solid, nothing ""award-winning"" but it's all enjoyable. I could simply spend time chatting with friends, drinking great local draft beer and eat ""fresh from the oven"" bread. If I do order, I typically defer to: Sweet Frites, Steak Frites (with Sweet Frites), Burgers. There is valet parking at night and there is a parking garage across and down the street. Easy either way."
August 21, 2013|Bar, not Brasserie|3|Twinkle lights and delicate curtains on the outside, rock-n-roll bar on the inside. It didn't quite line up. This is a burger bar, not really a parisian brasserie. If the music were different and the staff more polished, this could be a cute American brasserie. Food was ok and portions generous. Prices were reasonable. Good bar and drink list. Good place to go with kids, too.
August 14, 2013|True Brasserie Ambience and Cuisine|5|I was sad that I did not find this gem sooner, The appetizers are dinner sized portions and they have an incredible selection. Their specialty cocktails are totally off-the-hook. There are some incredible restaurants in this block but I find I go back to this one more than any of the others.
August 3, 2013|No complaints|3|Service was very friendly, but very slow. Our server approached our table quickly after we sat down, but everything else took forever. We weren't in a hurry, so we weren't too bothered, but it took easily 10 minutes to get our drinks, about 45 minutes to get our dinner. I realize it was a Saturday night, but the place wasn't even full, so I don't get why there was such a wait. I had the duck, my husband had a pork chop. Everything was good. Nothing wrong with anything. But there was nothing to rave about. I would go back again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
July 22, 2013|Food always excellent|4|The food is always excellent at Bravo. Good selection of wines and beers. The waiter did not know the beer selections and disappeared after taking our orders. He never checked to see if everything was OK with the meals.
July 20, 2013|We usually go to Federal Hill|4|We usually go to Federal Hill for special occasions, but since it was restaurant week in Providence, and Bravo Brasserie was offering a great discount. we thought we`d try it. Glad we did! Thanks for a great night out. J.S.
July 13, 2013|Delicious|4|The tuna tartar and scallops were outstanding and our waitress was awesome
July 13, 2013|Great value during Restaurant week!|4|4 great entree choices were offered during restuarant week plus 2 salad and dessert options. We had steak and fries, steaks were flavorful and cooked just right, fries were addictingly tasty. Creme brulee for dessert was light and delicious, chocolate cake was rish and decadent. All this for $30 during restaurant week- amazing!
June 30, 2013|great before theater|3|We have been to Bravo twice before walking across the street to see a play at Trinity Rep. For this purpose it is perfect. The salads (nicoise and caesar) we had were delicious and the seafood sampler appetizer was very good. The only problem with our visit was that they were about to close for a week and they were out of a few things. Service is energetic and friendly.
June 20, 2013|Nice restaurant before a show|5|Nice restaurant before a show at PPAC within walking distance
Dined on June 20, 2013|First time al fresco|4|We've eaten at Bravo quit a few times. But, never had the opportunity to sit outside. This was a really nice experience. The wait staff was attentive, even though the valet attendant was not ready and the hostess was not there yet, when they opened. The food was good, the atmosphere was good, and our server (Maureen) did a great job. Would highly recommend Bravo to friends.
June 8, 2013|Great Steak|4|Busy night, service well paced. Salads very large! Steak divine, cooked to perfection and tender, Mac and cheese was flavorful but disappointingly dry
June 1, 2013|Nothing great|3|We went in for lunch. The food was pretty pedestrian and the waitress was overworked with three crowded tables. Portions were big, with piles of overcooked, thin fries dominating the plates.
May 25, 2013|Great location across from the theater, ...|2|Great location across from the theater, everything was fine but nothing stood out as exceptional.
May 17, 2013|Noisy but good food and service|4|Rather loud, which was surprising since it was not very crowded for a Friday night. Food and service were very good and the menu had many options to choose from
May 12, 2013|Great place to have a Birthday|4|We went to the Brasserie after returning from France a few months earlier and had a thirst for more of what we had in France. The Bravo Brasserie did not disappoint. It was the charming and romantic setting that we had grown to love in Paris. Although the food was different than there it was incredibly delicious and well presented. The wait staff was great and I felt very comfortable and unrushed. It was a perfect place to go have a special Birthday and relive the whole relaxed French experience. I will definitely return again
April 27, 2013|We enjoyed the ambiance and|4|We enjoyed the ambiance and general feel of Bravo. Will definitely come back.
April 20, 2013|A great find in downtown Providence|4|We dined with a group of nine parents who were in town for a volleyball tournament. Everyone enjoyed the food, wine, drinks, and service. It is a great place to enjoy an excellent meal. The menu has lots of good choices. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. There are nice wines for $28-$35 a bottle and the bar serves some excellent drinks. I always recommend that anyone visiting Providence have at least one dinner at Bravo!
April 12, 2013|Food and service were very|4|Food and service were very good but it was very loud! I don't know if it's the accoustics or we just happened to be between noisy parties but it was hard to have a conversation. I really enjoyed my sole meuniere though and delicious bread and whipped butter. We split apple crisp for dessert which was just ok. Good place if you want a lively atmosphere but not if you're looking for quiet, romantic dinner.
April 5, 2013|Well, there was nobody here.|4|Well, there was nobody here. Odd for a Fiday night. We llove Bravo..for beore or after Trinity or Civic center. Sometimes the vallet is stressed and can be a bit over the top but ignore Him and leave the car. Food from sandwiches to meals. Nice wine list. I had my usual,Croque Madame which was too much to eat but made a nice snack next night.
March 23, 2013|I've eaten here many times,|5|I've eaten here many times, mostly for lunch. But my husband and I had dinner. I had the most wonderful mussels and feel the prices are very fair considering the quality of the meal and the portions. I will definitely be back!
February 26, 2013|Give your review a title (optional)|4|Bravo is a great place to enjoy dinner before or after a show at Trinity Rep, Lupo's, or the Dunkin Donuts Center. A diverse menu that let's you choose a quick, inexpensive meal of sandwiches or burgers all the way up to a fine dining experience of grilled steaks, surf and turf and other full meals. The atmosphere is always lively and the dining crowd is usually mixed including college students, theatre goers, couples and business diners.
February 26, 2013|Bravo produces a consistently|4|Bravo produces a consistently good product. Service is efficient and pleasant. Menu selction is varied and the daily chef's specials are never leftover combinations. Well priced and affordable. A great place to go before an event at the Dunk ot Trinity Rep
February 23, 2013|If you are a Trinity Rep go-er,|5|If you are a Trinity Rep go-er, it is the perfect place to eat either before the show or after, for coffee/desert or a drink.
February 21, 2013|Great for a pre-theater dinner.|5|Great for a pre-theater dinner. The staff was prompt and respectful of the deadline, and the food was very good. Nice ambiance, part theater-goers and many regulars at the bar. Very nice experience, and nicely priced.
February 16, 2013|Great food and service....only|4|Great food and service....only complaint was very loud patrons at nearby table....otherwise wonderful dinner. The french bread was hot and delicious!
February 16, 2013|Great dinner before the theater!|5|This was our first visit to Bravo Brasserie, prior to attending PPAC. My wife ordered the Roast Duck a l'Orange and I ordered the Atlantic Cod. Both dishes were wonderful! The couple with us both ordered the Penne in Pink Vodka Sauce, one with chicken, one with shrimp, and they both enjoyed their dishes, too. At our next visit to PPAC, we will be back!!!
February 16, 2013|Give your review a title (optional)|3|second time there first time food was great second not so good
February 15, 2013|BEFORE AND AFTER THE SHOW.|3|We like the opportunity to leave the car with the vallet while attending Trinity, PPAC or Civic Center event, sometime catching a quick drink at the bar before the event then eating dinner after the event. Meals run from burgers and sandwiches to steaks, etc. Wine choices are quite good and staff is always helpful . Often you are eating with the Trinity cast members who come to relax after the performance which adds a bit of excitement. So, good food, nice wine list, fair prices, incredible convenience....what more could you ask?
February 14, 2013|Date Night|5|My date and I had spent Valentines Day at Bravo Brasserie and it was astonishing. The moment we walked in, you could feel the love in the air. The lights were dim, due to the little candle, and xmas lights set around the restaurant. The service was fast, helpful and charming. Our food was impeccable and was executed in an appropriate time frame. My only comment is that the tables were a bit too close from one another. This by default, made it a bit awkward when it was to have a conversation, since you could hear what the other person was saying and they as well.
February 14, 2013|I went to Bravo on Valentines|4|I went to Bravo on Valentines Day, the downstairs lounge was moderately busy and had a good vibe. We dined upstairs, I was very impressed with the atmosphere, the ambience was perfect for a romantic dining experience. The staff was friendly and attentive without being overly intrusive. The food was a little disappointing, with such a great atmosphere maybe I was expecting better ( I should mention the dessert was outstanding). I will definitly be back to try again, maybe I will try apps and sandwiches this time. If you havn't been you should try it.
February 12, 2013|Great for Trinity pre-theater dinky|4|We love Bravo especially for Trinity Rep pre-theater dinner. Food is consistently good bistro fare. Service is always consistently exceptional.
February 6, 2013|we come all thre tie before|5|we come all thre tie before trinity...nothing more to say...except that coming for more than 6 years sort of says it all. And the valet parking...a wonderful idea.
February 2, 2013|A good place if you're out|4|A good place if you're out for a good burger or a full dinner. Great lively atmosphere and vallet parking in the city does help. If you're going to a show it's a good place as well.

January 19, 2013|This was my 3rd time to Bravo|5|This was my 3rd time to Bravo and it was really excellent. The food was great and of course the value that night with the $30 two for one special was an added bonus. We will be back with friends.
January 18, 2013|Bravo doesn't disappoint.|4|Bravo doesn't disappoint. The food is consistently good and the service attentive. Very reasonable costs at well.
January 17, 2013|great find in the theatre district|4|very cute french bistro. good food and ambiance. very convenient for catching a play at Trinity or PPAC. will definitely be back.
January 5, 2013|Have been here many times|4|Have been here many times before/after PC games or Trinity plays. Nice wine list, good selection of food, Meals and otherwise. We leave car with vallet for dinner and our function. Usually quite energetic early, quieter after our show/game. This time downstairs was packed and loud but they took us upstairs for the first time. Full bar there and tables generously spaced. Attentive but not intrusive waiter. Much more relaxed and unrushed. It was a great experience. Upon return after our game, about 10:30ish,downstairs was about half full but the bar was still active. Altogether a very nice Saturday night expeience.
January 1, 2013|This was our third time dinning|4|This was our third time dinning at Bravo Brasserie. The two previous visits were in the upstairs dinning area, with only two waiters trying to wait serve the patrons at the tables, and man the upstairs bar. We had theatre reservations (as we did this past visit), and barely made it to the show on time. This time we were sat downstairs. It was a completely different experience. The ambiance was wonderful. The food was great, and the wait staff was very accomodating. We will definitely return, ask to be seated downstairs, and ask for Aarin to serve us.
December 31, 2012|it was a great call by me|4|it was a great call by me to pick the restaurant for New Years Eve. My sister, brother in law and fiance all enjoyed the food. We were all very happy.
December 27, 2012|Average food by theatre|2|Bravo's claim to fame is it's convenient location across from Trinty Square. We had the mussels as an appetizer and they were very good. The rest of the food as very average. They have a large menu and might benefit from doing reducing their selection and increasing their quality.
December 27, 2012|As Trinity goers, we eat at|4|As Trinity goers, we eat at Bravo Brasserie often and always enjoy ourselves. The service is great; from the parking attendant to the waitress, to the chef, who accommodates my wife's special food restrictions. Sometimes it gets a bit loud, but overall, is satisfying.
December 22, 2012|Best thing about Bravo is|2|Best thing about Bravo is its location across the street from Trinity Repertory Theater, and its free valet parking for the whole evening. Also, the menu offers a wide range of prices. It is a very, very pretty place.
December 22, 2012|We've been to Bravo Brasserie|3|We've been to Bravo Brasserie before. We had a nice experience in all regards, except, unfortunately, for the food. It was kind of mediocre. It must have been prepared with a high salt content because all 4 of us were incredibly thirsty during the play we attended afterwards.
December 19, 2012|We were a party of 7 and wanted|4|We were a party of 7 and wanted to be out timely for a concert. The waiter, Rob was wonderful and accommodating. Drinks were great and not skimpy. Menu offers lots of choices to suit anyone. Food was served hot and portion size was good even for someone with a good appetite. Overall experience was wonderful. Quick Valet service just makes it a great evening!
December 19, 2012|What a perfect way to start|5|What a perfect way to start the night before a show at the Dunk. Our waiter was pleasant and attentive, but did not rush us at all. The food was very good with a huge selection, from salads and sandwiches to fish and tenderloin. Nice reasonably priced wine selection. There is no way to beat the valet parking valid for the whole evening if you are attending a show. How have we missed this spot before....
December 16, 2012|Met old college friends for|4|Met old college friends for a late lunch. Food was good and service was great. Prices very reasonable.
Dined on December 13, 2012|Great place. Beautiful interior,|4|Great place. Beautiful interior, great location. Food great. Great beer selection.
December 11, 2012|Bravo for Bravo|4|We go to Bravo often because we subscribe to Trinity Rep, which is across the street. We also go occasionally when we don't have theater. The food and service are consistently good, the menu is interesting with entrees and sandwiches, and Bravo takes reservations which is important when time is limited. They are also quick, so we are out in time for theater, but you don't feel rushed. The one drawback is that it is a noisy. We do not go to Bravo with elderly family who use hearing aids or who have difficulty hearing because of all the background noise. While they love the food, it is difficult for them to have or hear a conversation. Bravo also offers valet parking.
December 11, 2012|Food and service always good|4|Bravo is a mainstay for us. Food and service always consistent. Prices are reasonable. Bravo is the perfect pre-theatre dinner restaurant. We have reviewed this restaurant many times and always rate is excellent for a brasserie menu.
December 8, 2012|I went twice and got the tuna|2|I went twice and got the tuna appetizer. Both times the tuna was very fishy.
December 7, 2012|Outstanding|5|Bravo is one of our favorite restaurants in Providence. Good wine list, the food is delicious, the portions generous and the staff are friendly and professional. Whenever we go to PPAC or the Trinity Rep Theater, this our go to spot.
December 5, 2012|Show stopper|5|Sweet spot across from Trinity Rep., short walk to PPAC. Staff very attentive and good at getting you to your show. Food excellent, varied and creative. Very attractive.
November 24, 2012|Delectable|5|Everything was just wonderful! We were early for our reservations and the manager and server made arrangements and moved tables so we could be sat. Our waitress was very friendly, informative, and attentive. The food was out of this world. I cannot wait to go back there again. I am from westerly and had a great experience.
November 22, 2012|THE BEST & THE WORST|4|I could not have been more pleased with my Thanksgiving FEAST. The traditional Thanksgiving Dinner was the perfect menu choice. The dinner plate was piled high with turkey, squash, green beans almondine with the turkey MOUNDED over a more than ample serving of homemade stuffing. The dinner was priced just right: enough for me to enjoy a cup/lobster bisque, 2 glasses of wine and creme brulee for dessert. Dining alone, my table was in the bar area. No problem there; however, with other tables of the same kind available in the same area, mine was perched at the staff station w/full view of the kitchen, the various dunkin'donuts iced coffee cups right on the bar service area AND the expected Staff activity. Wish I had asked to be moved.
November 20, 2012|This was a pleasant surprise|4|This was a pleasant surprise -we were there on a Tuesday and had nice, very authentic French salads - the beet salad had beet slices the size of hubcaps, not those little artsy beets, and the frisee salad had a perfectly cooked egg that made the 'dressing' - and burgers, which were better than good. Cute place with big windows looking across at Trinity Rep, which was all lit up and charming. Free valet parking and nice French and southern hemisphere wines by the glass. I'd be tempted to try some of the more authentic French entrees on a return visit. Great place in a neighborhood sort of on the edge of downtown.

November 5, 2012|Higher Expectations|2|I've been here once before and the experience wasn't too bad. I returned on a date for the monday night special for two and didn't enjoy my time there. Our server seemed completely out of it and messed up our order. I asked for sirloin and was brought out a piece of salmon which was itself over-cooked!! He then returned the salmon and came back with my plate but by that time my dates meal was cold. I was actually a bit embarrassed. We didn't even finish our meal.
November 4, 2012|Great place and food, quiet|5|Great place and food, quiet after show dinner on a Sunday afternoon. No kid menu and the seating was a little crowded, but the food more than made up for it.

October 9, 2012|This restaurant is across|4|This restaurant is across the street from Trinity Rep, so it's a great spot for before theater dining. The food is very good and fairly priced for the city, offering salads and sandwiches in addition to the entrees - there is a pretty good wine list and valet parking also. All in all a convenient place to dine for any downtown event
October 6, 2012|I normally do not write reviews,|5|I normally do not write reviews, but Bravo Brasserie deserves one. The food was excellent and the mood of it cozy and energetic at once. The service was also excellent. Although our waiter was also waiting on a large group next to us, he frequently checked in with my boyfriend and I. He also gave us directions to some great bars in walking distance. I would go back to enjoy one of their many entrees, as I only had a sandwich.
October 5, 2012|Great place to eat/drink before|4|Great place to eat/drink before or after Trinity. We leave the car with t he vallet, have a pre-play wine then return for dinner after the play. Have enjoyed this tradition for several years. Above average wine list. Numerous choices, apps, sandwiches, dinners. Friendly and ingaging staff. We've always been happy with Bravo. This time of year, the sidewalk tables are warmed by imense flaming heaters, better than those glowing California heaters. We recomend Bravo!
October 2, 2012|Consistenly Good|4|Bravo is always a first choice when downtown or going to Trinity Rep. Food and service are consistently good
September 29, 2012|We ate here before a concert|4|We ate here before a concert the scallops were outstanding, veal okay, chicken good. The wine list was very good. We also came back after for some signature cocktails. They had lots of GREAT choices. Great spot, would go back and would recommend!
September 27, 2012|I would recommend it anyone|3|I would recommend it anyone who isn't in a hurry. Most of the food I'm sure is very good although a little pricy and the cocktails are extremely pricy. The server although adequate didn't appear to interested in her job.

September 17, 2012|Wonderful food! I especially|4|Wonderful food! I especially like the glasses the martini's are served in. My husband eats in the restaurant frequently for lunch and loves it! The service was good. The only problem was the air temperature was either hot or too cold. Every time the air came on it blew right down on your neck and shoulders. When it went off it got too hot! I will still continue to dine there anyway. We do like it.
September 15, 2012|AWFUL experience - went into|1|"AWFUL experience - went into restaurant at 5:30pm, place empty except for 2 tables (party of 6 and party of 4) in one corner of the restaurant. We were seated at a small two table inbetween these two parties. Then another party of 2 was seated in the corner, also between these two tables. The waitress could not get past our table without asking us to move the chair - and there was no place to move since we were squeezed so close together. My dinner companion went to ask maitre'd to move us (the remainder of all tables was empty) and he said he didn't have a table - all the other tables had reservations. He said 'I didn't do this, the computer did' so my shocked friend said well I'll never come back here - he said ""good, have a nice day"""
September 8, 2012|Food quality was good and|3|Food quality was good and very flavorful, however, the pace of the service needs improvement. Once we ordered the appetizers came out right away, but there was a LONG delay before the entrees arrived. That being said the food was well worth the wait and I would not hesitate coming back.
September 8, 2012|Had brunch here, the service|4|Had brunch here, the service was very good and helpful. Food was also yummy. The home fries were not a second thought which we appreciate. Seemed pretty empty for noon on a Saturday in a city, though. The vibe would have been more festive with more patrons in attendance.
September 1, 2012|Why would a restaurant make|3|Why would a restaurant make the poor waitress bring out the entrees when you are still eating your appetizers? And that is when you only have about another 5 minutes worth of appetizer to finish. I even said we weren't ready and she joked about the small amount of space on our table but still left the entrees! By the time we ate them, mine was only lukewarm with french fries that were limp and had zero crunch or crispness. And this is a bistro so it should know better. My sandwich was supposed to have avocado but there was none on it at all--the whole thing tasted like it was made earlier in the day.

August 2, 2012|Theatre district gem!|4|"Bravo Brasserie's location across the street from Trinity Repertory Company makes it an excellent choice for pre- and post-theatre dining. It's equally good for a business lunch -- good variety of lunch-sized versions of dinner entrees elevates it well above ""salad and sandwiches,"" yet not too heavy for midday. The signature ""Bravo Mussels"" are my favorite dish."
July 30, 2012|We had a meal here before|5|We had a meal here before a show at Trinity Rep. Very good service by a friendly and helpful waiter. I love the Bravo salad but didn't want to have the whole thing along with my meal. He made me a mini version and it was great. I had the Atlantic Cod dish: large chunks of fish in a broth with tomatoes, green beans and sliced new potatoes. Yummy! My companion had the Sole Meuniere and loved it. We were given warm bread in a paper bag - also yummy. The Oyster Bay Sauvignon was very good!

June 30, 2012|I had a better experience|2|I had a better experience at a previous visit to Bravo. They included a 20% gratuity on the total bill, including the tax. We were a party of six. I have never heard of tipping on the tax. My husband's steak had to be sent back, and when it finally arrived it was just on the plate without any side dishes. Everyone else had finished their meals. We will not be returning.
June 29, 2012|We will be back|5|We were a party of 7, dining before a show. We did have a reservation at an early time with our show in mind. We were seated, served and out in plenty of time. The service and food, all wonderful. Our dishes were very generous portions. All 7 in our party left feeling the same and we will all be back.
June 28, 2012|The food and service at Bravo|5|The food and service at Bravo is awesome. 8 of us were going across the street to see Motherhood The Musical at Trinity Rep and decided on Bravo for dinner first because with Bravo you can valet park, have dinner and walk right across the street to the show. The food was excellent and our waiter was attentive and helpful with menu selections, etc. I would definitely recommend Bravo for any occasion but if you're going to see a show at Trinity, then it's a must! Great night!
June 20, 2012|Fantastic Dinner|5|"Bravo is a great restaurant. The lamb chops are fabulous. Bravo was packed with women the night we went. We were all going across the street to the Trinity Rep for a show. We all made it to the show on time. Bravo even held my ""doggy bag"" for me while I was in the show. The menu has a great selection and healthy portions. We had a very nice waitress. I would highly recommend Bravo."
June 16, 2012|Waitstaff and food great!|3|Waitstaff and food great! The host/manager, Fred was clearly hammered and I waited over 30 minutes past my reservation time before he came to the host station to even speak to us. It was evident all the other staff (who were all great, even though overwhelmed) and other patrons were very aggravated with him. What a mess.

Every employee that we came in contact with were very friendly,accomodating and helpful,from the valet attendant to our server. The food and drinks were wonderful. Even the other guests were very friendly. People sitting on both sides of us were very engaging and especially one couple who were regulars,giving us wonderful rcommendations. Happy patrons are a true indication that we had made a good chose. We will definitely return and recoommend it to others.
June 6, 2012|First time at Bravo - things|3|First time at Bravo - things were good - but with a reservation for 3 was sat at a tiny bar table. I was disappointed in that - with a reservation you hope to be sat at a real table. So barely any space for 3 people to eat. Despite that food was good - we shared apps - food came out fast and was good. White Sangria was delicious! Try it!! All and all I would be back - if you are going to the theater (either one PPAC or trinity) - you really can't beat the location. Service was very good.
June 6, 2012|Service was okay. We felt|3|Service was okay. We felt a little rushed. Food was good. It came out of the kitchen rather quickly which made us think that it was prepared well in advance. All in all, a good experience but we were expecting a great one.
June 1, 2012|Good but a little disappointed|4|Been to Bravo several times before attending Trinity event. Always good. However, was a little disappointed in the poached pear salad. Good, but not great. Have had better salads elsewhere.

May 13, 2012|Convenient for Theater-goers|4|Bravo Brasserie enjoys the perfect location - directly across the street from the famed Trinity Repertory Theater. The food is very good (as is required to stay in business in foodie Providence) and the ambiance is cheerful - if a bit noisy when it's very busy. It's not my favorite restaurant in Providence, but it holds up well against stiff competition. If attending the Trinity Rep, it's one of a handful of great places in the neighborhood to enjoy a satisfying meal before the show.
May 13, 2012|Have dined at Bravo twice.|3|Have dined at Bravo twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. I would go again if someone suggested it but I am not sure I would seek it out as a regular spot. The Service both times was very good. Food was good for the price. Ambiance rated as fair b/c it is a small place and you share your space with neighbors and the waitstaff has to squeeze through at times to get past your table. Though it is small the noise is not too bad. If you have never gone and someone suggests it, I would not tell you not to try it for yourself. It is easy to get to and the Valet service is very convenient.

May 8, 2012|Service Exceptional at Bravo|4|We frequent Bravo often. Our love affair with this restaurant began when it opened some years ago. No matter how packed the place is, the service is exceptional and the food and price is consistent with that of a brasserie. We were a group of six having a pre-theatre dinner. Our server, Kellie, was phenomenal. She took our drink orders and dinner orders from memory and did not miss anything. Her attitude was so positive that we all felt that she loved serving us. While Kellie was truly professional at every level, she is not alone at Bravo—most of the servers there are exceptional as well. We love Bravo.
May 6, 2012|I took my mom to Bravo Brasserie|5|I took my mom to Bravo Brasserie before seeing a show at PPAC on Sunday afternoon. Our reservation was for 11:45. There were not many people there at first but it did start to fill later. I don't recall anyone needing to wait for a table. The food was very good. I had scrambled eggs with tomatoes and feta cheese. My mom had a omelet. The waitress was very nice and checked in with us. She also didn't pressure us to leave when we were done with the meal so we could talk before heading over to the show. It was a great choice!
May 5, 2012|Love this place!|5|We love this restaurant and always come here before PPAC or Trinity shows. Always friendly, great drinks and consistently wonderful food. Noisy but we ca. Still talk. Alive and fun.

Perfect spot and we loved the complimentary valet parking included for both dinner and the show - made our evening low stress! The service was great and we all enjoyed our meal. It was packed by the time we left and even after we got out of the show.
April 25, 2012|Great pre-show meal!|5|We had a great meal (I LOVE the Bravo Salad!) and had great service. They accomodated our need to be out by a certain time to attend a show. We had Calamari (for a meal), Asparagus Ravioli, Scallop & Bacon app + Bravo Salad and Bravo Chicken Sandwich. All plates were left clean!
April 20, 2012|The menu offers a nice mix|5|The menu offers a nice mix of well put together entrees and the wine list offers quality wines from different regions around the world. The atmosphere is pleasant and the service is good. This is a great place to take a date.
April 19, 2012|First time there. Food was|3|First time there. Food was passable but not the best in the city. I really liked the feel of the place. It was energetic before showtime and quieted down when everyone left for the theatres. Service was very good. I'd go again and maybe try a different dish.
April 17, 2012|It was lovely to be able to|3|It was lovely to be able to sit outside. The salad was perfect and my cod was delirious in the white wine saffron broth. My husband's salmon was fine and rice pilaf lacked seasoning. The cookie dessert was very good, but had way too little cookie and way too much ice cream. However, for our first visit-we were generally happy when we left.
April 17, 2012|Happy Birthday to Me!|5|My husband and I celebrated my birthday on a Tuesday night APR 17. The restaurant was full but you were able to move around easily. The food is absolutely outstanding. I had the sesame encrusted tuna, my husband had the lamb chops! Kelly (our waitress) was fantastic too! She was there when we needed her but not hovering as is often the case. The only bad part was we didn't have room for dessert...but we'll be back, the dessert menu had 4 of my favorites! What are you waiting for...make a reservation now :)

April 11, 2012|I was in Providence on business.|4|I was in Providence on business. Found this restaurant on Yelp and it was close to the hotel I was staying in. Ordered Moules and Frites and they were very good, very fresh, no closed shells. Went back the next night and had the same thing.
March 31, 2012|"One step up from a 'road house"""|2|"One step up from a 'road house"" chain, or one step up from a sports bar. I'm not sure why this restaurant receives such high ratings. The food was just okay and would not count as ""fine dining"" by any standard. Emphasis is on large portions, rather than on care of presentation. Oysters were fresh. Looking at other tables, the mussels looked tasty but I didn't order them so can't say."
March 30, 2012|"No ""Bravos"" for Bravo"|2|Because we had theater tickets, we were looking for a place near PPAC where we could get a quick dinner before the show. We had been to Bravo once or twice many years ago, and remember the food as being pretty good, however, on this occasion, we were all underwhelmed with our meals. The poached pear salad was fairly tasteless, the special lobster ravioli in pink vodka sauce was mediocre, and the sole meuniere was swimming in butter. The one highlight was the lobster macaroni and cheese, which everybody liked, but the other entrees, although not bad, were not particularly fresh or flavorful. The service was terrific, and the whole meal only took a little over an hour so at least we made our show on time!
March 23, 2012|Dinner was great - the food|4|Dinner was great - the food is always cooked to perfection. Great wine selection and also great desert selection. Love to hit Bravo before a show at the PPAC
Dined on March 20, 2012|Food and service above the norm|5|Bravo Brasserie is a mainstay for us both for lunch and dinner. We find the food very good and very moderately priced. Martinis are terrific. In our experience, the one thing that really stands out at Bravo is the consistently good service. This last visit and the visit before we had the same server, Robert M. He is perhaps one of the best we have ever had serve us.

Rather unsophisticated, with inexperienced waitstaff and hosts. Double-check your reservations: they frequently lose them. OpenTable is a better bet than their web site or phone.
March 3, 2012|I was a first time visitor,|3|"I was a first time visitor, grabbing dinner before a show at the PPAC, walking distance. Atmosphere and service was excellent, wine superb. Nice martini menu but I didn't have one. I was a bit disappointed in the entree's. The ""sides"" lacked originality, basic mashed potatoes, rice pilaf. My tuna steak was very good. My husband thought the veal lacked ""a sauce"". Overall just ok, I will likely try lunch there before crossing it off my list."
March 2, 2012|Don't miss out!|5|Restaurant was convenientely located to both the Trinity and PPAC, great atmosphere and food! Would recommend this to anyone/everyone in that area of Providence.

The staff do a great job getting the Trinity crowd in and out before the curtain goes down. A special mention: thank you for the gentleman who parks and retrieves the cars for the theater-goers..very efficient and nice to deal with.
February 18, 2012|Bravo always does it right|4|Bravo Brasserie has been one of our favorite restaurants ever since it opened for business. The food and service are remarkably good, reasonably priced and very consistent. On our February 18th dinner visit, the place was packed—even serving upstairs (our first time upstairs). We had show tickets and, because of our past history with this restaurant, felt confident that we would have a relaxing dinner and be out on time. That is exactly what happened. All four of us agreed that the Martini's were better than ever, the food was terrific, and our server was awesome (handsome, friendly, polite, professional and a very hard worker). These people do a wonderful job running a restaurant.

February 11, 2012|My wife and I had dinner before|4|My wife and I had dinner before a play at Trinity Rep. Started off with the calamari appetizer: unique (and tasty) seasoning with banana peppers and tomatoes, but the calamari were just a little tougher than optimal. I had the beef tenderloin medallions and my wife had the cajun pork chop. I thought the beef was a bit better prepared (pork was a little more than medium, but not dried out), but both were good. Portions were large, and neither of us stuffed it all in. It got a bit noisy as things filled up, but we could still hear each other well enough. Overall, pretty good for pre-theather dinner.

January 19, 2012|I went to Bravo Brasserie|5|I went to Bravo Brasserie during Providence restaurant week. I was celebrating my birthday with a small group of friends(8 ppl), and wanted to choose a place that could accommodate a variety of taste palettes as well as a comfortable, classy ambiance. In conjunction with a friends recommendation, I chose Bravo based on their online, featured menu for that week. I usually go out to eat to experience new food dishes instead of food that I would normally cook at home. Bravo had an interesting selection of dishes without being too frilly or complicated. The restaurant's huge windows and corner setting on a downtown block gives the upper-class feeling without the high prices. Overall, I had a wonderful birthday celebration.

We love the food and ambiance. This time we left the car with the vallet. So! Great French sidewalk cafe atmosphere, great food, (choice of sandwiches or dinners), nice wines by the glass, great staff and free Dunken Donuts Center parking for a vallet tip. What more could you want
January 8, 2012|Awesome night!|5|"We had a great meal at Bravos. The lamb, duck and pasta special were great. The Turtle cheesecake was outstanding. I loved the valet parking, we were able to keep the car at Bravos while we were at PPAC. It was waiting for us outside when we came back. The waitress was great with meal suggestions and even held our ""leftovers"" in the restaurant while we were at the theater. I would higly recommend Bravos."
January 7, 2012|My 10 year old is a budding|5|My 10 year old is a budding foodie and really enjoyed the cheese plate. Love that the valet parking is free, and that you can leave your car during the show if you have theatre tickets. Highly recommended!
January 7, 2012|Excellent food and service!|5|We had my daughter's10th birthday surprise party at Bravo before we headed to PPAC. I had forgotten something from the car and they went to get it for me so I could stay with the kids. The service was perfect. The food was excellent. My steak was exactly as ordered. The salmon was equally great.
January 5, 2012|A Providence Gem|4|I enjoy Bravo, and think that Providence is lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant. I have gone several times and am usually very impressed with the service, but I'd have to say that, on this visit, it was just okay. Our server was attentive, but often very rushed, even though it didn't appear to be a very busy night. Also, for the first time, I noticed that there was a television on in the bar area which is placed in an area where it is visible from the dining area. In the future I'll ask to be seated where it isn't visible. Oh, and I was running late, but I was able to call ahead and they were happy to hold my table for me. I really appreciated that. This is a great place to have dinner before catching a show at the Trinity R
December 31, 2011|New Years Eve|4|Went here for new years eve....it was great! Only thing I could complain about was their valet took a bit of time to come and grab our car, but it was very chilly and busy, so its completely understandable. It was a bit noisy, but loved the drinks. The service was great; the waiter was very attentive. Had the creme brule for dessert with champagne; it was wonderful! Will definitely come back.
December 29, 2011|I have been to Bravo many|5|I have been to Bravo many times, especially before attending Trinity and for Trinity special events. This time I had my teen-age granddaughter along, and she enjoyed people-watching and the pasta and caesar salad we shared.

December 16, 2011|Not worth the money or your time!|2|We were not greeted by the front of the house. He kept his head down, finally acknowledging us after a few minutes! There were four of us dining. Our fries were cold on all three plates, had to be sent back. My daughters mac and cheese with lobster was cold, had to be sent back...and she could only find about 3 pieces of lobster! Their prices are like a fine restaurant...their food is not so fine. The waitress kept apologizing, not her fault. They did take 10% off the bill, however, they will not see us again! Not worth the money, and not being greeted properly put a damper on the entire dining experience.
December 11, 2011|Enjoyed a wonderful lunch|5|Enjoyed a wonderful lunch after attending Trinity Rep's A Christmas Carol. Had made reservations for 5, (highly recommend making reservations). Seated immediately. Had great service and the food was fantastic. Suggest the lobster roll or beet salad- AWESOME!!

Dined on December 3, 2011|Gladly recommend Bravo Brasserie|5|I would absolutely recommend Bravo Brasserie for a night out on the town coupled with fine dining. My husband and I went for a romantic dinner just before heading over to the Trinity Rep, which is conveniently just across the street to watch a Christmas Carol. We booked an online reservation with Open Table through which I requested a table for two upstairs, as it is quieter and makes for a more intimate, romantic dinner; Open Table / Bravo Brasserie absolutely delivered. The calamari was excellent, crispy rings tossed with olives, tomatoes and banana peppers - delish! Our entrees were just as pleasing; they have a great selection and the service was excellent as well!
December 3, 2011|Great place for a special occasion|4|Great place to go before a Trinity Rep show! Food was good and they were able to accommodate 8 of us with a reservation we made earlier that day through Open Table. It was a little on the pricey side.

November 24, 2011|Unfortunately, there was steal|1|Unfortunately, there was steal wool in the soup and the waitress acted offended when we asked to have the soup removed from the bill. I would be hesitant to dine here again.
November 23, 2011|three birthdays|4|The restaurant was relatively quiet which was perfect for my birthday dinner with two cousins whose birthday it also was. Everyone was very pleased, it was not my first time, but everyone has not heard of or been there before. The warm bread at the beginning was great, and the music was Beatles which was outstanding. The waiter was kind and prompt, and my dinner that was the Penne Vodka with chicken was so great and filling. Thank you!
November 19, 2011|I have been here several times|5|I have been here several times and I enjoyed it each and every time. The atmosphere is nice and the food is very good. I like coming here before or after a show. The waiters are extremely friendly.
November 18, 2011|We are always happy to eat|5|We are always happy to eat here. Feel like France without having to guess what you're really getting. I had a veal special and my wife had the Steak Frite....really better than you'd get in Paris. A nice, fairly priced bottle of wine roped off our nice evening. The valet parking made it easy to drop in after a concert at the VMA
November 18, 2011|Bravo does not live up to|1|Bravo does not live up to the expectation of a restaurant in a prime location in Providence. For my husband and I all was poor with both a shrimp spinach salad and a veal dish. From the initial presentation there was disappointment. The shrimp looked uninteresting and the taste was unnoticeable. The veal dish was inferior to every other restaurant we have ever been to. I regretted my choice of where to eat that night. We chose it for proximity to our plans for that evening in Providence.
November 11, 2011|This restaurant is close to|3|This restaurant is close to the theatre and does a respectable job getting diners in out in time. The food is good, but not very innovative and the quality sometimes isn't what it should be.
November 11, 2011|Ideal dinner place for those|4|Ideal dinner place for those attending Trinity Rep. They will valet park your car for the evening, making it very convenient for those attending the theater directly across the street.
November 11, 2011|Always consistent|4|Bravo Brasserie is always a favorite dining spot for us, especially on Trinity Theatre evenings.
November 5, 2011|Good food as usual, but dinner|4|Good food as usual, but dinner theater line kept the asiles full of people throughout most of our 3 hour dinner. It's already very tight in there to begin with but the nonstop dinner theater wait line made it even tighter....people waiting in line were standing only a few inches from our seats most of the night....total lack of privacy.
November 2, 2011|The food is hardy and good.|3|The food is hardy and good. The location is wonderful if you are going to an event in downtown Providence. The service is great. They provide valet parking until you return from your event.
November 2, 2011|Tasty!|5|We had a great meal and the waiter accomodated our need for quick turnaround since we were attending a show at PPAC that evening. We were not rushed and had plenty of time to eat our delicious food. One of our party had The Bravo Chicken sandwich, one had Steak Frites with a properly cooked sirloin and tasty fries and one had the Filet Bearnaise. We all enjoyed our meals. On another visit, I've tried the Bravo Salad and highly recommend it!
November 1, 2011|A great dinner for two with|4|A great dinner for two with a friend. Have been dining at Bravo for years. So happy to see they take Opentable reservations. The food is always great, and the atmosphere is charming and never stuffy.
October 22, 2011|Everything about Bravo was|4|Everything about Bravo was excellent exc epth the seating arrangements. There is no way to have a private conversation, everyone is practically on top of everyone else. As a larger group, we felt we may have interfered with the conversations of the couples on either side of us.

October 10, 2011|Mussels were not scrubbed|2|Mussels were not scrubbed properly. Steaks were not good cuts and they were not cooked to requested temperature. To be honest the restaurant has a tired feel to it (felt like eating in a place that was more of a bar than a restaurant)
October 9, 2011|We were a party of 5 and no|5|We were a party of 5 and no complaints from anyone about anything. Everyone loved the grilled pizza appetizer. Veal Milanese was very tasty and tender. Those who had beef dishes were also very pleased. Good drinks and desserts too. The place was busy but the service was great, we were seated promptly and everything was served appropriately. Very pleasant atmosphere as well.

As we are not city folk, found the seating a little tight and noise level high for early dinner hour (6pm.) But when we come to Trinity, Bravo is usually our restaurant choice for the quality of the food and the ideal location.
October 1, 2011|Great French bistro fare.|4|Great French bistro fare. Felt like I was back in Paris like last summer.
September 23, 2011|Great place!|5|We were a group of six out for dinner before heading to a show at Lupo's. We were originally a group of eight, the staff was understanding and accommodating of our change in party size, still allowing us the larger table A few of were almost 30 minutes late for our reservation, and they were gracious about that as well! Delicious food, fantastic service. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and helped with decisions. Definitely would go back! Great location, easy to find off 95 - right down the street from Lupo's so we could park the car before dinner and return to our car after the show.
September 18, 2011|Brave Brasserie is right across|3|Brave Brasserie is right across the street from Trinity Theatre so it was a good place for us to go before seeing a play. It has a large menu and though everything looked good on the menu the general consensus was that the food was bland. The waitstaff was very attentive and it was a pleasant evening out.
September 17, 2011|very nice friendly staff,|4|very nice friendly staff, prompt service and outstanding desserts!
September 17, 2011|Our dining experience was|1|Our dining experience was spoiled by our waiter. After he had taken our order, he returned twice to check whether he'd gotten it correct. When the food was delivered, half of the dishes had to be returned because they weren't what we had ordered! We complained about the service and were told that they had noticed that something was wrong with our waiter and that they couldn't locate him! Our table was cleared by another waiter. As to the food, it was mixed: the salads were very good, but the Asparagus Ravioli was not to our liking. It was served in a thin broth and had peculiar flavors - not what we were expecting of a ravioli dish.
September 16, 2011|Food okay, but great service|3|Bravo has been through a few ownership changes over the past few years but had remained quite consistent. Service has always been exceptional and is still very good and friendly. Food was always fine in a brasserie sort of way. Good, not great, and reasonably priced. On this most recent visit, the food quality seems to have deteriorated. I had the Salmon which was fair, other's in our party of four commented that the food was okay, not noteworthy. Martini's are still terrific—but one cannot exist on them alone. As long as the service level remains highs and is friendly, this restaurant will still be a favorite of ours for Trinity Theatre evenings.

July 30, 2011|Ordinary at best|2|Whilst the service was great, the food was ordinary.Steak was tough and there was far too much pepper and sauce to taste anything at all. This was fair to ordinary at best only saved by extremely good service

June 15, 2011|Bravo Brasserie in Providence|4|Bravo Brasserie in Providence was a nice place to go before a show. They have valet parking and let us keep the car with them until the show was over. It was loud and a little cramped, but still a good place to get together with friends for a drink and a quick bite.
June 12, 2011|We went for dinner on a Sunday|4|We went for dinner on a Sunday after the matinee across the street at the Trinity Rep Theater. It's wonderfully close to the theater and parking; with easy access on/off I-95 and I-195. It's a traditional French-style Brasserie/Bistro with an excellent and diverse menu. It was clean and seating was comfortable. Prices are moderate and the food was excellent. They have a nice little bar. Wine list is of good quality, varied and moderately priced. Buy one dessert and get one free with our Trinity Rep Theater ticket. It wasn't crowded, so it was not noisy. But with all the hard surfaces, it would be fairly noisy when crowded.
June 11, 2011|Great place to go before a|5|Great place to go before a show at Trinity Rep- and they created a menu that reflected the show's theme!
June 9, 2011|Okay|4|Went to Bravo to eat dinner before seeing a play at Trinity. Had been there before and had very slow service so made a reservation for 5:45 for a 7:30 show. Service this time was fast and the waitress very friendly. Perhaps because it was a Thursday evening, we had ample time. As for the food, my meal of duck a l'Orange was average. The duck was fine but the roasted potatoes had the occasional piece of grit in them- not my favorite sensation while eating. Had Cookies and Cream for dessert, again, average. Did not taste homemade in the least. More like grocery store cookies with some nice quality ice cream, a strawberry sliced with chocolate syrup. Next time I will not get dessert. All in all a fine experience.
May 31, 2011|Wine is reasonably priced|4|Wine is reasonably priced and an excellent selection. Brings back fond memories of France! Quality of Food and service is consistent.

We had tickets to a show after dinner, and despite the full house for at 6:30, our waiter made sure we were served in plenty of time to get to the theater. My sole meuniere was excellent and the filet mignon with bearnaise received a big thumbs up from two others in our group. Being able to leave our car with the complimentary valet parking until after the show was also a big plus!

May 21, 2011|Great for dinner before Trinity|5|A friend highly recommend Bravo, so we made reservations to dine there before a play at Trinity. We loved it. The goat cheese pizza and poached cod were especially delicious. The service was fabulous, the ambience was delightful, and it was so convenient and stress-free to be right across the street from the theater. The valet parking was great, and we picked up the car after the show. We will definitely return!

May 14, 2011|I did not realize that a pub|2|"I did not realize that a pub style menu would be used for a Saturday lunch. I was taking my Mom there before a matinee shoe across the street at the TRT. We ordered soup and a sandwich. Mine was fine however when my mother took her first bite of the turkey club, she immediately toolk it out. I then took a whiff and knew the meat has bad. She was offered something else but because my Mom already had a ""bad taste"" on her south, she was afraid to try something else. I suggested that she at least try to eat something and order some mixed fruit. The sandwich was removed from the bill, the fruit was added, we paid our bill and went off to enjoy the rest of the day. We don't however feel that we would go back to Bravo anytime soon. Thanks"

The long loaves of bread served warm from the oven were a big hit. Being able to make on-line reservations early in the morning was perfect.

We were 20 minutes early for our reservation but that didn't throw the hostess at all and we were seated immediately. The server was efficient, pleasant and helpful. The food was delicious. The only thing that could have been improved was the fried ice cream, two smaller balls instead of one large ball would have made for a more appealing presentaion. This establishment will see us again!
