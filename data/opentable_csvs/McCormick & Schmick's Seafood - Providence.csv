February 28, 2016|Disappointing Overall Experience  Food to Service|1|I visited McCormick & Schmick's Seafood - Providence on Sunday 2/28/2016 to celebrate my husband's birthday. I saw that the restaurant had mixed reviews, but thought I would still give it a shot. I wished I hadn't. Online reviews where accurate. Our reservations were for 6:30p.m. Despite a fairly empty restaurant, the service was extremely slow (poor) with infrequent check-ins. The food quality wasn't what I expected at all. Very disappointing. I got the ultimate seafood grill. The seafood (scallops) didn't taste fresh and were dry and overcooked. The food was unappealing and it lacked presentation on the plate. The mash potatoes where cold. My husband got the stuff shrimp and filet. Filet was overcooked and had a strong charred taste to it. Definitely seems like it's a chain restaurant that doesn't take care in their preparation/presentation of the food. I regret celebrating his birthday there and wished I had picked a different restaurant. I won't frequent this or any other McCormick & Schmicks again.
February 28, 2016|Good Place, Poor Parking|4|The food is good, the service is good, the atmosphere is good. Parking is tricky.

February 16, 2016|Review after 2 visits|4|I will probably go back because it is close to the hotel I stay at often, but the food is just average. My first time there, my food was brought out with my appetizer and it was cold by the time I started eating it. The second time I ordered scallops. The scallops were bitter and not any good.
February 15, 2016|Very good food!|5|We have eaten here several times and the food is always good. For a fabulous dessert, try the Chocolate Bag, but bring a couple of friends since you will need to share. We have had several tasty seafood entrees and they are made well with interesting side dishes. Staff are attentive but not intrusive. Valet parking is a plus in the city.
February 14, 2016|Do not recommend|1|Do not recommend
February 14, 2016|High priced for the level of service|3|The food is above average for what you'd expect from a hotel restaurant, but the level of service was did not match the price you pay for this food. I ordered the calamari for an appetizer. Something that has been previously done extremely well in Rhode Island, and wasn't disappointed, but I also wasn't blow away. The batter was just a little too heavy, and the overall flavor was typical for your standard Rhode Island calamari. For my meal I ordered the Ultimate Mixed Grill. I wasn't disappointed by the flavor. Everything tasted great. What I was disappointed by was the cook on the shrimp. The grilled shrimp was overcooked, and the baked stuffed shrimp was cold. The salmon and scallops were cooked perfectly and tasted great. My issues with the service provided was numerous. They made a first attempt to seat us in one direction only to find there was no table there that could seat 3. So on the second attempt we went in the other direction, and were sat right outside the kitchen. Not a huge deal, but the floors weren't very clean. There were used napkins and containers that had fallen off a shelf on the floor. I asked the waitress if I could get a side of the truffle chive mash. She asked me if I wanted a side or to sub out the mash that my entree came with. I looked to my wife to see if she would share the side with me. She agreed, and I told the waitress that I would take the extra side. When the food arrived the truffle chive mash was on my plate, and i never receive any additional side. The waitress would disappear at times. It took forever to get our bill. I could see frustration building at another table who had their coats on waiting for their bill as well. A manager never came around to see how things were going. To put plainly, for what you're paying, you'd expect a higher service standard.
February 14, 2016|Warm hearts, cold hands!|3|"Went for Valentines Day with my husband. Valet parking easy and cheap. We mentioned to the hostess that it was chilly when we entered the door. She stated ""the whole hotel is cold."" Understatement! We were then seated next to a window and asked to be moved. We were taken to another room and again sat next to a curtained window. I looked around, everyone in the restaurant was wearing their coats. Kindly, the server placed us at a different table. This did not help. Personal heaters under tables. I was really surprised they played off the lack of heat when we initially complained. The restaurant could not have been more than 50 degrees. We were freezing most of the meal, it was such a disappointment to shop, buy a wonderful dress that I kept covered the entire time in my drab coat. We joked that the table cloth would also be worn by the end of dinner. Our server was very nice, energetic and understanding. He recommended a bottle of wine, they were out of. We had been seated for 30 minutes before this came to our attention. The bread took longer than expected and was less than average. Just more a filler than anything. The calamari was average. Oysters were outstanding according to my husband. My Mahi Mahi was amazing and the Marlin was very good but not my favorite! For desert we ordered the ""chocolate bag"" it did not disappoint and was so delicious we saved some to take home for our girls to enjoy. Which they did the next day. I still am in disbelief how cold this restaurant was, I feel they were obligated to inform patrons of the total lack of heat. Especially since they called my phone 3 times to confirm the reservations. It would have been better to make an informed decision than getting stuck eating in a miserable environment. With all the patrons in their coats, everyone looked fit to enjoy an evening ice skating rather than enjoying a lovely meal. Took 30 minutes to get our car back at the end of night. I had high hopes for this place, big let down."
February 14, 2016|Cold and cold|1|Placed was terrible would never go back restaurant was cold and food was tasteless and overpriced

It was extremely cold inside of the restaurant I asked the waiter he explained to me that the building was old and it takes a while for the heat to kick in. Last time I ate there I enjoyed it this time not so much
February 14, 2016|Too cold|4|The service was great. The food was exceptional. However the Biltmore Hotel controls the heat and the restaurant was very cold. I would hate to have them lose customers. It would be better if they moved to a different location. We love eating there.
February 14, 2016|Most Terrible Meal Out EVER|1|"freezing cold. NOTHING READY - [ARRIVED AT 12:30PM - OPENED AT 12 NOON - TOOK 15 MIN TO EVEN BE SEATED!!!!! food totally sub-par quality, presentation - NEVER GOT WARM - COULD NOT EVEN GET A CUP OF TEA TO START [TOLD: CHANGING KETTLES??] COULD NOT GET BREAD [BEING ""BAKED] CAME W/MEAL [TOO LATE]"
February 13, 2016|Granted, it was the night before Valentine's day.|4|Was packed and service was slow. Food was warm, not hot. But tasted good anyway. Need to add some French wines to the wine list.
February 13, 2016|Stake it out|4|McCormick's is reminiscent of the infamous New York as for the ambience. However the steaks do not measure up. My rare steak came out well done which was immediately dealt with but after my spouse had finished her surf and turf (apparently her shrimp were over cooked). It was a very cold night (-10 degrees) and we wore coats during dinner due to constant gusts of cold air even though we were not close to an outside door. We had dinner the next night at Capriccio's which was half the price and better quality of food; the quality and efficiency of the wait staff were both superb at both restaurants. Maybe it was just not a good night at McCormick's on a very cold night.

February 12, 2016|Service made up for Food|4|Both our meals came out under-done, but our waiter and the manager made sure that the food was cooked properly. Two of the scallops were cooked, and two were not, but that was remedied.
February 7, 2016|It's just a ok chain restaurant nothing ...|3|It's just a ok chain restaurant nothing special. At least this time they didn't report us not being there, they have a poor computer system and more then once they said we didn't show up.
January 30, 2016|Very Poor Service|3|"The wait staff can ruin a perfectly good meal as was the case this past Saturday night. We were escorted to our table with little wait by a very friendly hostess. However, once seated it took Stacy, our waitress, about 15 minutes to acknowledge our existence. She finally returned to take our drink order. Three of us were sharing a bottle of wine and the fourth person opted for a glass of wine of a different variety. His glass came promptly, but the bottle of wine took at least another 15 minutes. After another absence, she returned to take the food order which was served in a short period. The food was okay. My wife had the salmon and claimed it was overcooked. My friend ordered the pork chop with macaroni and cheese. He noted how tasteless the mac ""n cheese was but the pork chop was good. When the end of the meal came, Stacy brought the bill but did another disappearing act and didn't return again for at least 15 minutes. This restaurant is okay but will never get 5 stars."
January 27, 2016|Excellent ...|5|The only negative part of this dining experience was at the beginning. The restaurant wasn't empty yet we still had to wait almost 10 minutes for someone to greet us to be seated . We came close to leaving (but it was too cold out). Our server was very personable ... the food was outstanding!
January 21, 2016|Very enjoyable Thursday evening!|5|CHris, our waiter, we knowledable and very friendly. The food was excellent and we had a very enjoyable evening with our friends.
January 18, 2016|Restaurant week - complete steal!|4|I haven't been in the restaurant at the Biltmore since it was Davio's and it's nice the see the place again. The restaurant is in great shape, a dining room similar in style to steakhouses in the area, and the big windows facing city hall give an unique view of downtown. We went for restaurant week lunch and it was a total deal - the crab and corn chowder, the salmon saute and the individual desserts were all very good and a great price. Would definitely go back for lunch any day and may put it in the rotation for dinner just to check it out at night.
January 14, 2016|Great seafood in a old downtown elegant hotel|4|Went out for a special occasion and wanted to try this venue. Had stayed at the Biltmore a few years back but not ever dined here. We were very pleased with the food. Seafood menu was extensive and extremely flexible. Spouse and I both enjoyed our dishes very much. Also, felt the wine list had good variety and reasonable prices.
January 13, 2016|Our Restaurant Week choice!|5|"It has been many years since we visited a McCormick and Schmick's. We reviewed many Providence area restaurants for a visit during ""Restaurant Week"" and the items offered at M&S's caught our eye. We wanted to try the blue crab/corn chowder - and did. It was absolutely fantastic. The main dishes were also great. We had only one choice for the dessert though, a molten chocolate cake dish. We might suggest next time to have something ""transportable"" so it can be taken home if desired. This dessert was so rich we might have only eaten half (each!) if it could have been taken home to finish!"
December 31, 2015|Have had better nights there. They seeme...|3|Have had better nights there. They seemed to be understaffed for the night. Lots of waiting with lots of empty tables. Food very good as always.
December 31, 2015|food was amazing but has become more expensive.|5|"They have new booths that are so uncomfortable that we had to move to a table, although the booths afford the ability to ""people watch""and see downtown Providence. The new booths need to go!"
December 31, 2015|New Year's Eve|5|We had a great experience. We were staying at the hotel for the holiday so decided to start our night with dinner at McCormick and Schmick's. Glad we did. The chef's choice of stuffed salmon was delicious. The waitress was very attentive and the bartender was creative when we asked her to surprise us with a celebratory shot to start the festivities. Thank you for the great time and we look forward to visiting again!

December 25, 2015|Excellent Christmas Dinner!|5|Food and service were excellent! The atmosphere was great and the restaurant quiet. Overall an excellent experience.
December 19, 2015|Food was good, Service not so much|3|This was our first time eating here. Although the food was good, the service was terrible to so the least. I had the steak and my wife had the lobster. For the price we paid for the food we expected better service.
December 19, 2015|PPAC night out|5|Went at last minute prior to going to an event at Providence Performing Arts Center. The waitress - Stacey - and staff were exceptional and most informative as to menu and wine selection. The filet mignon melted in your mouth and my wife's fish fresh from Ri waters. Look forward to next visit
December 17, 2015|The food was great once we received it. ...|2|The food was great once we received it. Service was very slow, dinner for four people took over 3 hours and the place was empty. I have visited this restaurant before, but service was never that bad. There are too many other good restaurants in Providence to put up with poor service.
December 16, 2015|Great restaurant and a good location|5|Enjoyed a wonderful dinner where the food was exceptional and the service was to notch. Definitely would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion and food which was over the top.
December 5, 2015|terrible steak, worst ribeye I ever had,...|1|terrible steak, worst ribeye I ever had, totally disappointed. Took a client aand his wife and was totally embarrasesd
November 29, 2015|Was Surprised!|4|It was a Sunday evening, we had reservations and didn't need them. It was the most empty place I've seen. I could only guess that nobody goes out on Sunday evenings in Providence, RI. There was an abundance of attention from the wait staff. It seemed as if we had our own private attendant. Food; good quality adequate quantity.
November 20, 2015|Dinner|3|Busy Friday night with reservations got put last table near bar. Many tables were empty. Very noisy! Service was slow and waitress never came back to refill water. Manager brought the check.
November 8, 2015|Thank You Again for Honoring the Veteran's|4|Went with my niece for the Veteran's Day meal. Server was polite and Thanked me for my service. Meal was prepared well...No Complaints.
November 6, 2015|Great Meal, Wonderful Service|5|My wife and I had dinner at McCormick's and Schmick's before the theater last Friday evening. The service was very quick and efficient, and the waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. Both of our dinners were wonderful, and the deserts were also very good. The restaurant is conveniently located in The Biltmore, and is very close to PPAC and other night venues.
November 3, 2015|Delightful Dining Esperience!|4|We made reservations for dinner before a show at PPAC. The server asked if we were going to the theater and said he'd make sure we got there in time. He was attentive and very well informed. We were going to share two entrees and his suggestions were perfect. We had had drinks in the bar before dinner so drank glasses of water with lemon, which he kept filled for us. He didn't hover but was very pleasant to talk to. The food was delicious - I would highly recommend the Ultimate Trio. We've never had a bad meal at any Landry's group restaurant - this one included. You can get free parking at the Biltmore for three hours with a ticket validated from the restaurant. The additional two hours were a total of 16.00 - quite a deal for parking in Providence.

Dined on October 17, 2015|Providence Found!|5|My wife and I had dinner before a show at PPAC. The food (pan seared scallops topped with shrimp scampi and parmesan crusted flounder) were both very good and the service (Chris) was fantastic! We will definitely be back.
October 11, 2015|good food but bad service|2|no complain regarding food but staffs definitely need proper training .
October 4, 2015|Great experience|5|We enjoyed our meal here. Great menu selection and lots of help from the server and the kitchen staff to work around a food allergy. The Mahi Mahi was great!
October 2, 2015|A little disappointing|4|I'd eaten at the McCormick & Schmitt's in Boston and really liked it. Had a nice cocktail. Ordered salmon en croute and I thought there was too much cheese, a soggy crust, and salmon was less than 100%. My partner really liked his seafood mixed grill. Not many people in the restaurant but our waitress was often hard to track down. A lot of money to pay for a somewhat disappointing experience. (Oh, web site said valet parking was $5 but it was actually $7.)
September 18, 2015|Anniversary|4|"The waiter was exceptionally good - both attentive and very knowledgeable about the food and wine. We were delighted to receive custom menus printed on glossy stock with the following line printed at the top: ""Happy 48th Anniversary""! They really made every effort to help us celebrate and enjoy our special anniversary dinner."
September 6, 2015|Food is excellent, service was spotty this time|4|Outstanding fresh seafood, very well prepared, with wonderful sides. Nothing overly creative but everything was excellent. Halibut was extraordinary. Service was generally good with a couple of misses - water glasses ran out and after a few minutes waitress asked person nearest her if she would like more water. Seems unnecessary to ask and they shouldn't be allowed to run out. But when she brought the water, she only filled the one glass and left. We never were offered bread with our meal nor coffee/tea with our dessert. We would have liked both. We've not had this happen previously, and they were busy so it was hopefully an exception. Otherwise, friendly staff, great place for nice occasions. We were celebrating birthdays and they provided a special dessert which was a very nice touch, much appreciated, and delicious. We enjoyed the meal immensely.

My wife loved her lobster bisque and seafood medley too. Great drinks (including an assortment of non-alvoholic drinks for my pregnant wife) and top-notch service. I'd recommend it to everyone.
September 2, 2015|very mediocre|3|visiting for one night. convenient becuase in hotel. staff friendly and accomodating but extremely cold and unable to adjust AC. Food was disappointing. my tuna was not rare as requested. Generally not worth the prices chrged f=given many options in surrounding ara.
August 30, 2015|An excellent couples dinner|5|We had a reservation and were promptly greeted and seated. The menu was fairly extensive, with a focus on fresh fish and beef. The food was served in a time frame reasonable for someone on an evening date, but not someone watching the clock. The quality was excellent. For the food ordered, the total check was reasonable.
August 29, 2015|Mostly good food and service.. Just don'...|2|Mostly good food and service.. Just don't order a drink on the rocks....two sips and its gone...
August 22, 2015|Always enjoy the experience and food there|4|We always like the fresh seafood and steaks. I like the new decor of the restaurant. We come typically for special occasions, but last night was just to get out and enjoy a nice meal. Sometimes cant decide what to have and we get a surf and turf which never let's us down. Yum! Had a great sour pear martini. Looking forward to our next meal there.
July 24, 2015|Acceptable|4|Convenient to downtown hotels. Food was not remarkable, however.
July 18, 2015|Horrible Service|1|We had dinner with our 3 children, one of whom is in a wheelchair and another is in a high chair. Our waiter, while very nice, provided horrible service. He had to ask for our order twice and then forgot our drinks three times. After waiting a great deal of time, we had to ask another server for our dinner. Our children had finished their meals well before we had gotten ours. Therefore, the kids were becoming a bit restless. When the check came, we were billed for items we had not purchased. We called the manager over. He was very nice and assured us that he would correct the bill and take off the price of the drinks and desserts. He returned to get further clarification of our order. He then returned with a new bill. It was incorrect again. We were charged for a dessert that we did not order and he did not remove the price of the drinks. However, we decided to pay the bill and leave the restaurant.
July 10, 2015|Fresh fish|4|We went on an impulse because of a desire for oysters. There were several varieties on the menu and we chose some fConnecticut Blue Point ones. Our server was chatty and caring. The restaurant is in a hotel and does a lot of convention business. Comfortable surroundings.
July 5, 2015|ok not great|3|Service was mediocre at best. Everybody had to hear how he was overworked because it was a holiday weekend. Food was good not great.The steak was over corked in the stuffing for the stuffed shrimp had a fishy taste to it and the shrimp were rubbery
May 23, 2015|Good Thing We Were Not In a Rush|3|Our family went for dinner before Water Fire. In addition, there were lots of people having celebratory graduation dinners. However, this is a big restaurant and should be prepared for a full house. The service was slow, the hostess absent at the front desk, and food delivery confused. The quality of the food was good. They are very gluten-free friendly and family friendly. It took so long to get a dessert menu that we skipped it and got our check instead. I have been to the NYC location with much better service. It would probably be a better experience on a slower night.
May 23, 2015|Nice Lunch|3|Enjoyed a nice lunch, with a group of eight, after a recent graduation in Providence. I had the fried shrimp which were fresh and tasty. Grandson had the pasta off the kids menu which was better than the average kids meal. A few misses on the steak and burger temperatures but all in all a decent meal in a nice atmosphere. Staff was very pleasant.
May 16, 2015|Would have been 5 stars but the service ...|4|Would have been 5 stars but the service at the start was a bit discombobulated and the booth seats were fairly uncomfortable, especially for my pregnant wife. However once we got out drinks and appetizers, we were very satisfied. Our entrees were outstanding (I had grilled halibut, wife had pan seared cod) and the dessert list was fantastic. Everything tasted fresh and arrived hot, cooked to perfection. Would definitely recommend a friend and we will be returning again soon.
May 16, 2015|lunch|3|service was very good. Food was good. Decor and lighting could be updated. Overall it was serviceable for what we needed.
May 11, 2015|OK - just not great|3|Went for lunch with wife. Food was OK - the flounder was a little under-seasoned and the kobe style burger was listed with red onion aioli on the menu...but was instead, a bunch or marinated red onions (not a sauce). Temp in the restaurant was very hot that day. One door was left open, but no air conditioning. Waitress was great and offered us a complimentary dessert due to the heat.
May 1, 2015|Double trouble|4|"If you split a check watch out for the ""recommended tip' calculations on the charge slip. The tips are based on the total bill, which can lead the unwary to double-tip."
April 25, 2015|Enjoyed all aspects|4|The food, ambience, service and price were all excellent
March 29, 2015|My husband had a client come into town a...|3|"My husband had a client come into town and we decided to take him as it is usually great. We were extremely surprised in the service and as my husband said ""if this was our first visit we would never go back"". The restaurant was very slow and probably only 5 or 6 tables were filled yet the waitress we had was awful, and the food was not up to what we normally have. I am not sure if she just doesn't like her job or what but it was certainly not the level of service we have had in the past. We tried to tell her about the food and there was no response, no I'm sorry nothing. It was very disappointing to say the least."
March 8, 2015|Early birthday celebration|4|Went in for an early birthday celebration. The host (wish I remembered her name) was absolutely awesome. Working in the service industry myself, I experience a lot of let downs that could be simply fixed. This host did not hesitate to help make the night special. By getting me glasses for my hotel room, setting up a special menu with a happy birthday and my girlfriends name, suggesting an awesome dessert with another happy birthday, and reserving another dessert which was later 86'ed that night. She really helped pull it together. Food was also pretty top notch, it just took forever for each course. Whether that was kitchen or a server issue, I'm not sure. I'm usually not a quick eater but that was especially slow for me. My server was also very nice, but she would just get lost for huge amounts of time. I didn't need anything in particular, but the helped exaggerate the 30 min between courses and the overall 3 hour meal. \ Overall all, service not awful, food was awesome, and pretty good for celebrating. I usually would've loved a 3 hour dinner, but tonight I was looking for a normal night. Miss Host( whoever you are) you definitely saved the review and put some faith back in the service industry.
March 7, 2015|Food and Service were outstanding.A bit pricey.|5|I would recommend for a special occasion.Not for people who are looking for an inexpensive meal.Food portions were also a bit small so if Someone has a big appetite this is not the palce for them.
February 27, 2015|Front Desk|3|The front desk at the door that we entered did not have anyone at it. No one approached us to tell us to go to the other desk. There were three bartenders who did not comment to us. There should have been a sign telling us to go to the other desk which was the entrance from the hotel. We entered from the street. We have never had this problem at this restaurant before.
February 14, 2015|food presentation and proportion are awful|4|I went in a snowstorm walked in hostess said they were full even tho 50% of tables were empty but I got a res on open table the food is adequate presentation is awful waitress was very good
January 31, 2015|Still a big price - not up to Mc&S standards.|3|Pretty surprised. Food was average. Waiter was very friendly and nice. Still pricey.
January 23, 2015|Decent food and presentation|3|Our waitress was spacey and had no idea that it was restaurant week when we were there. (Odd) The food was pretty good.
January 17, 2015|Not bad|3|Service was excellent, food was ok, was just look warm when arrived.
January 1, 2015|Anniversary Dinner|5|"The service was friendly and solicitous. The food was over the top great. I had the salmon stuffed with crab. Yum. We shared a chocolate cake for dessert and it had ""Happy Anniversary"" written in fudge sauce. Nice touch."
December 31, 2014|New years Eve dinner|4|I read the reviews before I arrived. They were not very good. I was pleasantly surprised when my meal was finished. My dish was cooked perfectly and they made my wifes dish exactly as she wanted it. The service was very good. The manager insured that we were very satisfied. I would recommend to my friends.
December 27, 2014|Disappointing....|1|Not a good experience at M&S in Providence on December 27, 2014! The chopped salad was delivered the same time as the entrees, not before as we expected and is customary. The server (Ashley) just said she was sorry and had the manager (Glenn)come over to say sorry and that he would comp the salads. The chopped salad turned out to be soggy and had little to no bleu cheese, compared to my previous visits at M&S. The server brought us a small sliver of bread (for 5 people) and said she'd be back with more when available. Twenty minutes later, I had to ask for more bread - the server brought it with no explanation. When our meals arrived, the tuna steak was cold and very dry. And during the entire diner, the lights in the restaurant were going from bright to dim every 20-30 seconds. When I asked the server what the issue was with the lights, she said they had several other complaints from guests and then explained the new dimmer had broken but that it would be fixed soon. I counted 17 empty tables and remain convinced that the lack of good service and quality food was not due to a busy Saturday night at M&S. Completely disappointing venue and dinner.
December 25, 2014|Christmas standard|5|Dependable venue, especially on Christmas, when choices are scarce. Great service, inspite of the holiday.
December 25, 2014|Not Worth the Price|3|McCormick & Schmick's Seafood was not worth the higher price for below average food. We have no issues when it comes to finer restaurants but this is just an expensive Chain Restaurant. Our calamari was over done and very dry, my husband could not eat his clam chowder due to it being spicy (they gave us credit for it), his crab cake was very good, my stuffed flounder was almost cold, dry and blah, and my husbands steak was a good supermarket cut. The best part was dessert, our mocha cheesecake was excellent. Bottom line if you want to spent almost $200 on a meal there are many other amazing places in Providence.
December 19, 2014|Food was good.|4|Bright lights made me feel as though I was in a dining hall.
December 18, 2014|service was terrible, waiter not very attentive|2|inexperienced waiter, never checked on us and she never cleared plates off the table! food was not what was expected from this restaurant. very disappointed
December 17, 2014|Solid Experience|3|Good lunch special and service! Enjoyed the fish and chips and shrimp.
December 7, 2014|Could do better|3|We arrived for an early lunch on a Sunday and were seated on the edge of the dining room area, in a booth, close to the bar. Tables in the dining room were still being set up for the day's business. There was quite a bit of noise as ice was being distributed in the bar area. As the first table to be seated in the dining room, it was disappointingly close to five minutes before a server came over and my party considered getting up and leaving. Once there, the server was very attentive and provided courteous service. The food was nicely presented and flavorful, but not memorable.
December 6, 2014|Pretty bland. No hostess to greet us.|3|Food lukewarm and at the best ordinary. Server was ok and enthusiastic but atmosphere and experience not great.
Dined on December 5, 2014|disappointed|3|portions were small. blackened salmon was not blackened and the fillet was full of bones. pie was microwaved so crust was soft and mushy. their Thanksgiving dinner was much better.
December 5, 2014|Overrated Longhorn Steakhouse|2|I took my husband here for this birthday and we expected the food to be better than it was. We could have gone to the Longhorn Steakhouse for half the price and gotten much better tasting meals. Service was slow, but everyone seemed to be rushing around. I don't wish to give a bad review, but It was NOT what I expected. Disappointed I chose this restaurant for a special occasion.

November 27, 2014|My husband took me to M&S for my birthday.|3|It took almost 3 hours to complete our meal. Our food was lukewarm when it arrived. The fish was good but the green beans were raw. Everything took much longer than it should have.
November 27, 2014|Bad service, cold crab cakes.|2|I've gone the past 4 years for Thanksgiving with my family of 5 - but I will not return. The waiter was slow and there weren't that many diners at 3:30. We waited 18 min for drinks. Waited another 15 to order our food for a total of 33 min before ordering. When we got the food it was not impressive. Crab cakes were mushy and cold. Lobster mac wasn't great either. Spent well over $180 and it was NOT worth it! I'll be scouting a new place for next year.
November 27, 2014|Good but.....|4|We went for Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey was a bit salty. But overall food was good. My sister and I ordered martinis and we both had to send them back. The second ones were better but not exactly how they should be made. For $12.50 each they should be beyond perfect! Not to mention I was charged an additional $2.50 per drink for Chambord. ?What? $15 for a martini? On a very positive note, our server Jared was excellent! He was so kind and did everything possible to make our experience a good one! Thanks, Jared for your superb hospitality!
November 27, 2014|Great food. Great Atmosphere.|4|We decided to make a reservation for Thanksgiving for five of us. Appetizers, Drinks and Service was great. Only one person in our party actually ordered the Turkey which was very good and large portions. My wife and I both had Seared Scallops. Mine were excellent. Hers were not cooked all the way and she sent them back. Unfortunately, by the time they brought her plate everything else on the plate was cold. However, she said the Scallops, like mine, were excellent. Wait staff was very attentive. Great atmosphere. No crowding. Plenty of parking. Unlike Boston.
November 9, 2014|" The ""F"" Bomb"|4|"The booth behind us was extremely loud and constantly dropping the ""F"" word. I was surprised that none of the staff said anything. I was going to say something but my guest requested me not to. It really took away my attention from my guest I wanted so much to have a talk with the party but I gave in to my guest request and swallowed my pride and kept quiet. I know this is not the norm, it is a great place to eat. I differently will be back."

November 9, 2014|1st time visit|5|Very impressed w/ service and menu. Plan to return in the future.
November 9, 2014|Reliable and consistent|4|Always enjoy coming here because I always know the food will be top quality and the service very personal. I would recommend they get another bread (or roll) supplier, as this institutional-tasting white bread is not up to their previous standards. And whatever happened to the she-crab soup?
November 9, 2014|Consistent|4|The food is always good here. The blackened chicken fettuccine was delicious. The beef medallions were incredible too.
November 9, 2014|Thank you|5|My husband and I are both Veteran's. McCormick & Schmick's shows their appreciation by giving Vets a free meal. The meal they serve is outstanding. You get a wide variety of choices. The food is fantastic!
November 9, 2014|Military Friendly|5|Thank you for the free meal for Veterans Day. Very nice gesture.
November 8, 2014|Disappointed|1|We have been going to McCormick & Schmick's for years. Something has changed, the menu was no longer offering daily fish specials, service was poor and food was tasteless. I will say the oysters were the only item that was as good as we remembered. Will not be returning. :(
November 7, 2014|Service was excellent.  Swordfish specia...|5|Service was excellent. Swordfish special was delicious and clam chowder was right on. Not rushed. A little pricey but food made the grade.
November 3, 2014|Dinner|4|I was disappointed that at 6:15 I ordered a chef special and was told they were out of it on a Monday at 6:15 if they were busy during thd week why didn't they restock on Monday
October 29, 2014|Somewhere else dining|2|Poor atmosphere, poor quality steak for price, cooked incorrectly. GREAT service. Clearly inexperience bar personnel. I was forced to select a choice in question # 2. Clearly you don't feel anyone could possibly have negative feelings about your restaurant. We drove several miles to get to your restaurant. We were incredibly disappointed. Will NEVER return!
October 28, 2014|Convenient|2|Positives: Convenient if you're staying at the Biltmore. Nice ambiance. Excellent mojito. Spinach salad with candied walnuts and balsamic vinegrette was also very good. Negatives: Server couldn't explain/didn't know how entrees were presented, and seemed more concerned with upselling us on appetizers than providing good service. Stuffed shrimp were very small, and haricot verts tasted as if they had been sauteed in dishwater. My dinner companion order a filet medium and it was well done. We ate very early (5:30 pm), and I wonder if they had a sous chef or apprentice training or preparing meals at the early hour. I would try this restaurant again if i were every staying at the Biltmore.
October 24, 2014|Good GF menu|4|Service was good, food came fast, wine list was better then average.
October 21, 2014|GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR DINNER|1|Waited over 1 hour for entrees that when arrived were incorrect and cold!
October 18, 2014|Okay|3|We have dined many times at this location but had not been in over a year because the portions seemed to be getting smaller and smaller, and they had replaced their signature (and exceptional) hot bread with not hot rolls. We ordered a simple cod meal and a Chef's Special of swordfish with accoutrements that was tasty and savory although the piece of swordfish was thin for that dish's price tags of $30.99. Also had the mussels to start--very tasty broth with grilled bread to soak it up--and a Caesar that was fine. The portions of the hot foods were satisfying because we ate everything but not large in a culture where everything has become so. That's fine--just don't expect to be taking anything extra home from this restaurant.
October 5, 2014|service slow|2|Went their for business dinner on Sunday night due to its close location to the Conv. Center. It was about 30% full, and the hostess was MIA. The lobby smelled like a old mop, and it just smelled musty in the place. The server was well versed in her presentation, but the bartender hindered service and it took forever to get a bottle of wine served to our group of 6. The seafood was good and no one in the party complained. Timely service was an issue as the place, and it was mostly empty. I would pass.
September 22, 2014|Great Steak, Seafood & Staff.|4|Very good NY Strip, prepared perfectly, just as ordered. Shrimp Scampy was the best I ever had. Will return for sure!
September 14, 2014|Disappointed|1|Service wasn't great. Our waitress seemed fake. And even the hostess or manager (not sure) had an attitude when I asked a question.
September 9, 2014|Great seafood|4|Great seafood as usual and friendly server. A goog choice when in Providence. No bad surprise.
September 5, 2014|Fresh seafood, well prepared....|5|Consistently fresh fish, a nice selection of seafood and preparations, some simple and some creative. Attentive but not stuffy service. Always a nice dining experience.
August 20, 2014|Server was challenging|2|The food was good, but there was no value in the entire experience. We spent $130.00 and it was a little dissappoining. The drinks were small, the server was a hot mess, and I would not recommend anyone to go there. I could spend the same amount of money for a better experience at Hemenway's, which I plan to do next time.
August 16, 2014|Not as Good|2|We came here this past New Year's Eve. The restaurant was busier and the food was better. This time we chose the restaurant for our 45th Anniversay dinner. The baked cod was low quality and cold. The shrimp trio had shriveled up fried shrimp, super salty scampi and the stuffed shrimp had a hint of iodine. We realized that the restaurant has cooks but not chefs to prepare a menu of never changing dishes.
August 16, 2014|  Last week was our 13th anniversary.  A...|1|Last week was our 13th anniversary. After being seated, we were given the special drink menu, my wife ordered a Pommegranate flavored drink. She was told they did not have the necessary ingredients. She then ordered a hot apple cider drink, which they also said they didn't have the necessary ingredients, then came back and said they could make it. We placed an order of 2 appetizers. The waitress proceeded to take our dinner menu. When the meals arrived, my wife had the wrong dinner. She had ordered the Chef's special salmon and was given a salmon dish from the menu. I ate my meal while my wife watched me and I did the same. My wife's meal, which she did not order was comped, but it wasn't a memorable experience.
August 9, 2014|Overall extremely good|4|We were a bit apprehensive about trying this restaurant because it's part of a large chain. We were pleasantly surprised when everything was very nice and upscale. We were seated immediately, the service was good, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was well done. We will definitely return.
August 7, 2014|Wouldn't Go Back|2|While my wife enjoyed her seafood dinner, my steak was dry and burned on one side. The issue was less that it was medium-well rather than medium, and more that it was charcoal on one side, with that bitter taste permeating the meat. The restaurant did comp the steak as a kitchen error, which along with the other service, earned 5 stars for service, but the fact that it happened plus the meat being overcooked and dry drop the rating for the food.
August 2, 2014|Decent food. Poor table service.|3|Our server was new and very inexperienced. For a Saturday night, the place was slow. Very few customers. Unfortunately, our server was unable to make recommendations because he's never eaten anything on the menu. The restaurant was dead and for good reason. Disappointed in our experience. I would not recommend this restaurant. Note to management: Stop bring cheap and let your servers try the food so they can make proper recommendations.
July 19, 2014|Restaurant week|4|Enjoyed the experience. I was surprised and the lack of patrons especially during restaurant week.
July 15, 2014|they never found our reservation but pve...|4|they never found our reservation but pverall, it was good
July 13, 2014|Uncomfortable|1|Went for the first time since I've always wanted to try it. As soon as I walked in, there was no host in sight making the feeling very unwelcoming. Luckily a patron who was sitting by herself also waiting for service asked the bartender to seek a host. After sitting down, the feel was very uncomfortable and unwelcoming so my wife and I decided to just walk out. I'm sure the restaurant is great but guess we decided to go in on the wrong day. You figured since is restaurant week they would be a bit more prepared for guests and patrons to be greeted as they should.
July 12, 2014|McCormick and Schmick Review|2|Drinks excellent. Bartender excellent. Food was good but based on price could have been more. Service was slow. New waiter. Seemed confused. Dinner took over 2 hours. Was glad I was in good company with nowhere else to go. Appreciated manager stopping by and birthday greeting.
July 12, 2014|Horrible Service|1|I would never recommend going to the Prov. location. It was a Saturday night but not too busy to warrant such AWFUL service, plus we were only a party of 4. One of us ordered a bottle of wine, coke and water...water came 30 min later, coke came after 2nd request. One in our group dines w/ clients at M&S & raved about dessert so we asked to see the dessert menu 4X's before we ordered (to make sure we left room)...menu came after dinner. Husband ordered 2nd drink never came but showed up on bill. Guest asked for Bread 3X's we were told it was in the oven came 1/2 way through dinner, it was COLD. Husband's dinner came late, odd it was raw fish. Waste of nice evening & $$. They should be ashamed for having her on the floor.
July 12, 2014|We had dinner before attending Waterfire...|5|We had dinner before attending Waterfire. The meal was superb and the service was exceptional.
July 12, 2014|It's been better...|2|Normally McCormick and Schmick's is one of our go-to restaurants and is on our Top 10 list for Providence. But, we've had much better experiences than we had on this Saturday night. Our server was not very good, e.g. promised water 3 times, but didn't bring until 15 min later, slow, couldn't find her, etc. And, most importantly my flounder and my husband's shrimp were overcooked. On the other hand, my sister's salmon was cooked perfectly. So, they got 3 out of 5 dishes right. We really do love this place, so we're going to give them a second chance and put this event in as the one miss in the last 5 years.
Dined on July 11, 2014|Food was awful. very small portions and ...|1|Food was awful. very small portions and not was tasteful. Service was great. Would not go back
June 28, 2014|Smelly & Yucky|2|We sat at the bar and their was a strong smell of bleach and I could even taste it in my wine glass. Then we walked from the bar to our table and the bottom of my shoe soles stuck to the floor. The bathrooms were in the basement - had to go down 3 flights of stairs (not good for the elderly). The lobster was very dry. We are overall very disappointed in everything.
June 28, 2014|good dinner for a traveler|4|I ate at this restaurant two nights in a row with different friends while on a business trip. I had the Mahi Mahi one night and the second night I had the flatbread and a Caesar salad. The fish was excellent; the Caesar salad was okay. The second evening the room was very cold. One of our members had to return to the room for warmer clothes. The wine selection was plentiful and priced reasonably. The service both nights was excellent.
June 28, 2014|We have been going to McCormick and Schm...|1|We have been going to McCormick and Schmicks for 10 yrs. never ever have we had a worse experience! From the moment we walked in there were problems. First the 2 girls at the hostess stand could not figure out the computer to seat us. Second, I was seated in a chair that was about to fall apart. Next we waited 20 minutes to finally realize that no one was assigned our table so no water or bread. Then we told 2 or 3 people including the hostess and still no response. Then, we got a waiter and he was great and the fish restaurant ran out of salmon and it was only 7 PM! The portions were tiny. My husband got one strand of broccolini on his plate and finished his steak before his potatoes were served! We paid almost $200 for this!!
June 27, 2014|never again|2|The room temperature was so chilling. Many tables complained and staff informed there was nothing to be done since system tied to the hotel. Many lunch dishes had salmon and when we were ready to place our order we were only then informed there was none. Tasteless scallops, sole and shrimp. Very disappointing.
June 25, 2014|excellent signature vegetables|3|my ribeye, although cooked to my liking, had a lot of silver skin and was not very flavorful, and the accompanying brocolini was nearly raw. The signature vegetable side dishes of wild mushrooms and spinach, and, the grilled asparagus, were excellent. My table mates were not impressed with their fish entrees, but they also liked the vegetables. We felt that our service was lacking, besides being slow, although we had an early seating and it did not appear busy.
June 21, 2014|Had dinner for a girls night out.  For t...|3|"Had dinner for a girls night out. For the food, the only thing I recall thinking, ""wow, this is good"" was the walnut salad. Everything else seemed just average. I got the impression you were paying for the ambience of being in a fancy hotel however the actual quality and uniqueness of the food (including specials) wasn't anything that would draw me back with so many other options in Providence. It was quiet which was nice for a conversation and the service was perfect."
June 6, 2014|Fish to perfection|5|Both my boyfriend and I ordered fish entres - he ordered salmon and I had mahi mahi. Both were cooked to absolute perfection. I will definitely be coming back.
May 31, 2014|RISD Graduation Dinner|3|Second time here... server was very nice and attentive. food arrived before cocktails bar service was bad..... Ribeye was average quality which seemed a miss for your brand as a landry's.. Scallop dish was really good, veggies cooked right augratin pots good overall value for the dollar seemed weak however you prices wer high for the quality of food you served we are restaurant operators ... Thanks
May 24, 2014|Lovely Experience|4|Went for a Commencement celebration along with hundreds of others. However, had reservation months in advance and in fact the host was able to seat our large party earlier than planned. Unfortunately, the restaurant ran out of several of our favorites. The pasta dishes were heavy on pasta and not so much on the fish so the price paid did not equate the food received. Overall, the attention of the wait staff and lovely atmosphere made up for the shortage on food.
May 17, 2014|Great food, poor service|3|This is the second time we have gone to this restaurant. Both times our food was great, but the service was leases that so. We had to as for bread and water. My so in law ordered surf and turf .... They brought him the meat, but no lobster tail,he had to wait 20 minutes for that. Considering that there were hardly any other diners in the restaurant at the time we were there it was overall a disappointment. We spent over 220 $ but no one really made us feel like our party was important. I liked the food but would hesitate to go again due to the service.
May 12, 2014|Downtown Dining|3|Nice downtown spot - close to everything. Great service! A little too pricey for breakfast.
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day Disappointment|2|Took my mom and sister out for a mother's day dinner. Bad Bad Bad..I wrote a whole review but the do not give you enough space...so I leave you with this. Do not eat at chain restaurants. Support local folk who give a damn about what they are feeding you.
May 11, 2014|Delicious Food - Slow Service|3|Mother's Day dinner with the wife and kids. The food was amazing from the appetizers to the main course was delicious. The atmosphere was pleasant inspite of a loud party behind us. The only negative was the waiter was off his game. There seemed to be a few missteps in getting our food in a timely manner. Not my first time so I'll just give this visit a pass.
May 11, 2014|Not that bad|2|Positives: 1) We were seated on time. 2) We were able to get an accessible table for my father who has mobility issues. Negatives: 1) Not being offered any bread like the other tables. Thankfully I ordered the wedge salad or I would have been starving by time the entrees arrived. 2) Service: Even accounting for the fact that it was Mother's Day, service was slow. The runner who brought our entrees to the table got a nice round of applause! I might go back again, but definitely not on the weekend.
May 11, 2014|Going down hill|1|We were looking forward to a wonderful Mother's Day brunch, only to find out that they did away with the brunch buffet. Fine..we will order from the menu. Ordering from the brunch menu we were later told they were out if a few meals. Really? At 11:45am? Service took so long and they complained to US about the new management. Spoiled our Mother's Day!!
May 11, 2014|Terrible Service|2|We were there for Mother's Day Brunch. The food was just above average but the service was terrible. Took 20 minutes to get coffee and tea. Then had to wait another 10 minutes for the milk for the tea. Another half hour before the food arrived. We weren't in a rush but sitting for almost 45 minutes before we were served seemed a little long.
May 9, 2014|Great before PPAC|3|We usually go to M&S before attending the theater, tonight's meal was a little disappointing. My dinner Swordfish Casino was warm but not hot, my wife's veggies were very dried out. Seems like maybe her Salmon might have taken longer than expected, and they threw the other meals up on the hot plate to keep them warm, but left them too long. On the plus side, the food was very flavorful and the Salmon was done PERFECTLY! The service as always amazing. We will go back, but next time bring it to the servicer's attention that the food wasn't cooked to our liking.
May 4, 2014|Service was slow even though it was a Su...|4|Service was slow even though it was a Sunday afternoon and not very busy
May 3, 2014|Disappointed|2|"Although our table was ready upon arrival, no one came to our table for 10 minutes. After ordering cocktails and requesting bread for the table, we ordered appetizers while waiting for our drinks. My wife's bisque was served about 15 minutes before my appetizer arrived. The bread came to the table between our apps being served. Although her fish and chip dish was good, it looked more like fish sticks than a fillet. My dish, a ""surf & turf"" was 3 baby quarter size beef medallions and a steamed lobster tail, tasty enough but well overpriced at $33.00. The service staff was unorganized as well as the kitchen because the food was served sporadically. Live and learn; we will never visit or recommend this restaurant in the future."
May 3, 2014|Very Dissapointed|2|From start not a good experience...6:00pm out of many items , server brought small wedge of bread for 4 people -dry/stale, when we asked for fresh piece he said , it's been sitting out on counter a while, only allowed one wedge per table. Didn't take back for fresh or offer extra . My sister ordered salmon with roasted vegetable she could not eat due to food sensitivity, server said can't substitute, then came back an hour later (we hadn't received our meals yet) and said they were all out of the vegetable and would be substituting another their choice would not allow her to choose a substitution she liked. It took another half hour to get our meals. Vegetables over-cooked, salmon ok. Clam chowder however was very good.
April 30, 2014|Great for lunch|4|We have had lunch here several times before seeing a show at Trinity. The service has been somewhat slow but everything else is excellent.
April 25, 2014|Good seafood|3|Good place for seafood. A little pricy for the portions. All around good place. Not terrific, but enjoyable.
April 19, 2014|Not impressed|2|"Oysters weren't shucked properly. Spent more time picking out chunks of shells than eating them. Manager took 4 off the bill out of 12 and titled the discount ""Did not like"". Discount wording was unprofessional and inaccurate. Food was just okay. Presentation was definitely lacking. There was more space on the plate than food. Disappointed in the experience, especially for the price."
April 18, 2014|Not what I was hoping for|2|I have always heard great things about McCormicks restaurants but absolutely nothing was worth mentioning except the terrible service
April 16, 2014|Boring flavor|2|The crab cakes, shrimp kisses, and fried calamari was great. The Kolbe burger was terrible, it was blane boring and flavor-less. It came with a side if kettle potato chips? Are you serious. Overall the server was awesome but the entrees were not worth it. Also we had drinks for the first twenty minutes and after that one of the guys actually got up and found one of the ice water containers to refill the table. I am disappointed and I don't think I would ever come here again honestly.
April 11, 2014|Good Experience|4|McCormick & Schmick's was good as usual. I enjoy the Providence restaurant.
March 29, 2014|McCormick & Schmick is always|4|McCormick & Schmick is always one of my favorite restaurants. Service was outstanding. I had the beef medalions and lobster tail, which was great. My wife had the Carribean fish, which was ok..
March 26, 2014|We dine here regularly when|5|We dine here regularly when attending shows at Trinity Rep. The food has been consistently good and the service just as consistently friendly and efficient. The seafood is fresh and well prepared. If anything, our most recent visit was the best of all. Highly recommended.
March 22, 2014|Lunch disappointment|2|We enjoy eating lunch before going to a matinee at Trinity Rep. We had plenty of time before the show, so we were not too concerned that our meals did not come out quickly. Unfortunately, only one of our four meals came out as we had ordered them. One of us carefully avoids dairy and requested that there be no cheese on his sandwich, but it came out with a generous slice of cheddar. His wife's meal was supposed to be almond encrusted trout with butternut squash risotto, but she got grilled trout with mashed potatoes. My wife got her crabcake, but with the waiter running back and forth to fix the other problems, she did not have the heart to complain that she had not gotten her poblano tartar sauce. We went down the street for coffee.
March 17, 2014|Horrible|1|Went St. Paddy's day for corn beef and cabbage. Meal was tasteless and portions were small. Meat was chewy. Cabbage looked weird; like it was old. Restaurant was empty. Service was good.
March 15, 2014|No Appetizers|1|This was our first time in Providence. We were staying at the hotel where McCormick & Schmick's was located. Ordered two appetizers they were out of all of them. This was Saturday night at 7:15 pm. The third appetizer was shrimp cocktail, they came to the table and told us the shrimp was warm and I am sure you do not want warm shrimp cocktail. We asked them to chill the shrimp we will wait. The other appetizer was calamari, over cooked and grease. The mahi mahi was ok, I had it topped with dynamite crab. I asked the waiter if the crab was spicy. He said no I like the crab and hate spicy food. The crab was so spicy I had to remove form the fish. The service was poor from the beginning to the end.
March 15, 2014|Birthday Surprise|5|Made reservations for 12 for my husband's 60th birthday. I couldn't have been more pleased! The waitstaff was outstanding and went over and above to attend to our needs! The food was brought to the table in a timely manner and everyone's dish was cooked to perfection. We all enjoyed our meals and would definitely visit again!
March 15, 2014|Great Experience|5|My experience at McCormick & Schmick's was simply first class. Chris our waiter was delightful, and really made our night a night to remember.
March 8, 2014|Service was not acceptable|1|Service was not acceptable not very friendly. Food was rushed. The quantity of food for the price was high.
March 5, 2014|Great food but trick to get seated.|4|The food is always great, and I love the ambiance of the restaurant. The only negative is checking in, especially if you enter through the hotel (as the signs directed us to do on Wednesday). Though there is a hostess stand, there is never anyone there, and unless a wait staff member wanders by, it isn't clear how to get seated.
March 3, 2014|Bad dining experience|1|The evening began with our having to wait at least 5 minutes for the hostess to appear from somewhere in the back of the restaurant. It was 7 pm and not at all crowded, so there was no excuse for there to be no one at the front. Next we were seated at a table where immediately I felt a chilly draft coming from above. We requested another table and there my spouse was under the chilly blowing air. Finally, the third table worked. Our server, Andrea, was very sweet and did her best. But she and her peers were clearly not well trained and this led to very slow service. She did not check in with us to see if we needed more water or another glass of wine or more bread. The food was ok but definitely not worth the hefty prices.
February 22, 2014|stale food|1|I ordered fish and chips and husband ordered fried fish sandwich. both meals were awful and tasted like the food was in the refrigerator for days. dry, tasteless and tough batter.
February 17, 2014|When went on a Monday night|1|When went on a Monday night when it wasn't very busy. No one was at the hostess desk so we waited several minutes to be helped. We were seated in an area with a lot of traffic and right next to the lounge(very loud). It was obvious that we were on a romantic dinner (both dresses up) and our table was right next to a couple family tables with kids. There were tables next to the window away from the louder area but didn't get to sit there even though we had reservations. I thought that usually gets you one of the best tables in the house. It was so loud that we couldn't hear our waiter when he finally showed up to greet us(10 min) later. Food portions were very small, didn't taste great and was cold. Never again($150 + tip)not worth it !!
February 15, 2014|Disappointing Valentine's Lunch|1|Decided to take my wife for a Valentine's lunch on Saturday. The restaurant only had a few tables occupied but was sat directly next to the bar which was extremely loud and cold every time the door was opened. Could hardly hear waiter due to the noise and being soft spoken. Then once we received our food a waitress came over telling our waiter and us he had taken someone else's food and had given it to us. Waiter muttered something and left. My wife didn't know if he was coming back with her correct food or if she should continue eating. After 10 minutes waiter came back saying food was the same (definitely not since the pasta was not what was ordered) and that waitress was unprofessional. Expected more from visit but left dissapointed.
Dined on February 14, 2014|Not impress|2|Went here for Valentine's Day. Had reservation for 9:45 via Open Table. Got there 10mins late and didn't tell us that they were backed up. Waited until finally got to our table and sat at 10:30! So it was a 45 mins wait. Ordered calamari as appetizer which was good and wanted Lobster bisque so bad but they ran out! My husband ordered Fish n' Chips which was pretty ok and I ordered 9oz steak with asparagus on a side. Presentation wasn't good for what you pay for and I wanted Medium and my steak was sort of burnt and dry no blood at all. I was disappointed considering it was a bit pricey. Nice to try the place out but I'm never ever coming back to that place. Not impressed at all! Sorry.
February 14, 2014|Not pleased|2|My boyfriend and I went for a romantic date. Our reservation was at 9:30 but we did not get seated until 10:15, even though I saw more than 4 tables that could have been cleaned. While we were waiting for our table, I tried to get a drink at the bar and was not acknowledged for 20 minutes. Our server was friendly but my meal was disappointing with 4 pieces of ravioli and no scallops. While we were waiting for our meal, the kitchen ran out of lobster bisque, roasted potatoes, and scallops, which was supposed to be included in our meals. Our table was close to the kitchen and gave off a bad ambience. I can appreciate the restaurants theme and menu, but I was not pleased with this dining experience.
February 14, 2014|Expensive and Busy|3|My girlfriend and I went here for Valentines Day. We had reservations for 8:45. We got there for 7 so we could check out the bar. The place was packed and busy especially it being a Friday night AND Valentines Day. In an hour and 45 minutes we got 2 drinks as they only had 2 bartenders on, on a Friday night and Valentines Day (makes sense). By the time our table was open, it was 9:45 as they must have overbooked. I had the ribeye with lobster mashed potatoes. She had the stuffed salmon. Both meals were delicious, but undersized, especially for the price tag of 110 before tip. There are plenty of other great places to go in the city. Don't waste your time.
February 14, 2014|Slow service|2|MY wife and I arrived at 8:15 for a 8:30 reservation, and was told that it would be a while. Since we were15 minutes early we went to the bar to grab a cocktail, which took 15 minutes to get. While I paid for the drinks my wife went to check on our table, open arrival she observed a couple who came in without reservations get seated immediately. After consulting with a manager we got a table at 9:00, 30 minutes after our reservation. Food: To be short, They ran out of bread. Rhode Island Style Calamari took 30 mins. While our entrée took 45 mins. Should have gome to Fleming's or Capital Grille
February 14, 2014|Excellent Food!|4|Took my girlfriend here for Valentines Day, and despite having an 8:00pm reservation I didn't get seated till around 8:20-8:25. However, once I was seated the waitress was very attentive and friendly. She gave good recommendations for the appetizer, and the one we chose was delicious. The entire dining experience was excellent and I would recommend this place to friends.
February 14, 2014|service|3|I liked the food, but was not impressed with the service. I know it was a busy night but we asked for water, never got it. Ordered coffee and tea, got it, asked for sugar, waited, finally asked another passing waitress. Why wouldn't you just automatically bring sugar when you brought the coffee, tea, and milk? Odds are somebody at the table would use sugar. Also, had reservations for 6:30 and in all honesty we were late, but did call to tell them we would be late (10 minutes). When we got there apologized for being late, but still had to wait 15 minutes. If they had reserved the table and we called why did we have to wait? Would it have been ready if we were on time? It was kind of like a Seinfeld episode.
February 14, 2014|Wait Wait and Wait|2|we made reservations for valentine’s day with Open Table. this was probably the only part that went smooth 1. we were seated right away and they recognized our open table reservations 2. we waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged after we sat down 3. we then waited another 10 minutes to be asked if we wanted a drink 4. we waited another 20 minutes for 2 drinks to be delivered from the bar 5. one of the drinks was wrong 6. waited 25 minutes to return the drink and order dinner. at this time we just requested our bill from the manager and left without eating we witnessed 2 more tables experience the same poor service. This would have been fine IF the restaurant was busy but it was at 60% capacity so being busy was not an excuse.
February 14, 2014|Wonderful Service, Food, Drinks|5|McCormick & Schmick's Seafood in Providence was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The waitstaff was fantastic. The food was fresh and delicious. Recommend to the highest degree.
January 18, 2014|Great for seafood oriented|4|"Great for seafood oriented people. Some beef and pasta available. Drinks good. Try ""Hot Apple Pie"". Service timely. They turned our order around quite quickly. Best to use the valet parking. If you choose, M&S is in the Providence Biltmore so a nice room would undobtedly be available."
January 18, 2014|Slow service|3|Had reservation for 6:30. Arrived early at 5:45 and was seated right away. Service was friendly but very slow. Meals were both tasty but not memorable. Long wait between courses. Waited 20 minutes before dessert came even after explaining we had to get to an event that started at 8:00. Entire meal took nearly two hours even though there were some empty tables.
January 11, 2014|will never return|1|"overpriced, frozen appearing, overcooked steak. worst we've ever seen - anywhere. service was terrible. martinis fair. bottle of wine was fine (when it finally arrived just as our entrees were served). non inviting bar was cold in both ambiance and temperature. crab and corn chowder was oily. oysters good, bread fresh, warm and delicious. customer service at its worst, leaving this restaurant in the category of ""typical chain"" rather than ""fantastic upscale steakhouse"". disappointing is being kind. will never return."
January 8, 2014|Sbm7|5|My friend and I got thier early. Seated us right away. Wine suggestion was right on. Excellent wine, our waiter knew a lot about wine and food suggestions. The food was awesome.
December 31, 2013|New Year' Eve|4|The atmosphere in the restaurant was classic and warm. The food was very good. The service was excellent. The prices were fair. My wife and I enjoyed our New Year's Eve dinner feeling like our restaurant was a great choice to send off the old year.
December 28, 2013|Fair-to Midland|3|"This place lacked the ambiance of a ""special"" place given the high prices. Food was good and waitstaff was good enough but it just wasn't worth it. I will likely spend my money somewhere else in the future."
December 27, 2013|Great food - wonderful waiter!|5|We had a lovely time with our family having a delicious dinner here! The Chilean Sea Bass, the pan seared salmon and the stuffed salmon were all to die for! We were fortunate to have Chris as our waiter. He was entertaining while still fulfilling our every need and made very good suggestions! We will definitely be back!
December 25, 2013|I expected a special Christmas|4|I expected a special Christmas Day dinner menu, but my choice from the menu was a good light choice for my appetite that day.
December 25, 2013|Caesar Salad?|3|Great atmosphere! Food overall very good. The Caesar salad was made with iceberg lettuce believe it or not! When pointed out to the waiter, he acknowledged the mistake. He then proceeded to bring the same iceberg Caesar to the next table.
December 24, 2013|Very good service and overall|4|Very good service and overall quality of food. Romantic Christmas Eve dinner. Very friendly and courteous staff. Great ambience. Valet parking.
December 24, 2013|changes|3|the menu has changed since Landrys took over - not as upscale. but still good. usually great service but not this night. will return.
December 24, 2013|Disappointed at Christmas|2|not handicap accessible waitstaff not attentive, rude poor choice of non-alcoholic drinks weak highball cold coffee CREDIT CARD MISPLACED!
December 20, 2013|Delish!|4|Great seafood dinners, as always oysters were amazing!
December 14, 2013|Specialty drink ordered. Was|1|"Specialty drink ordered. Was made with whiskey instead of rum. Nothing more than a remake with simple 'were sorry"". One steak was ordered M/W. Came between rare and MR. To quite a long time to get it cooked correctly. Everyone was 1/2 done when it came. Again, a ""were sorry"". Place was very quiet, so no excuses..... Even a token were sorry offer would have been nice."
December 7, 2013|my experience|2|Our seating was under a vent and it was very cold. I had to keep my coat on, which took away from the experience. We were told they had no control over the heat. The food was not as good as we had had on previous visits. The flounder dish had more orzo than flounder, which is what we were paying for. I don't mind paying extra if the dish is worth it, but in this case I felt we were cheated on a full serving. We were told by our server it was a full serving. The talapia however was delicious. The restaurant was not busy at the time we went, but from seating time to finish, it was all of 45 minutes. We kind of felt rushed. I'm not too sure if we will be back, this has always been one of our favorite special occasion restaurants.
December 7, 2013|General|5|Food was excellent! The waiter (Chris) was an important part of the dining experience. He was very personable and his suggestions were spot on! Will definitely return soon.
November 28, 2013|Nice Thanksgiving|5|Thanks to the staff ot McCormick & Schmick's for delivering a very nice Thanksgiviing dinner for people like me how have no friends or family close by. Everything was very good but most of all, the service was excellent. Our waiter was fantastic!
November 28, 2013|Thanksgiving Dinner was just okay|2|Food was sub-par. For the price, the quality was mediocre and unremarkable. We expected better.
November 28, 2013|Great meal, but slow service|4|Our party of eight had Thanksgiving dinner there. We could have ordered off the menu, but there was a excellent turkey dinner special. It was a great meal and all were very happy. The only downside was that the staff was a bit slow. A request for extra gravy had to asked three times and the meal took about a half hour to get to us after ordering.
November 23, 2013|Great food, service, eh.|4|Food turned out to be great. But, the hostess station needs improvement. No one was present when we entered, staff at end of bar felt it was more important to finish their conversation before seating us, and, there was no one there as we left. We were sat at a table with settings for 4 & it took a several minutes before our server arrived to remove the extra 2 settings. Our server, Brie, was friendly but not necessarily sophisticated. She was somewhat challenged opening the bottle wine, having to place the bottle on her leg while balancing on one foot to insert the corkscrew. The oysters were good & the seafood was cooked well, tasted great. Could have been advised they came with sides when we ordered, but the additional sides were good.
November 22, 2013|Uneven Experience|2|Went for a late lunch...No hostess and seemingly no one in the restaurant... Lone waiter and patron in bar area as we sat ourselves after waiting for someone for 2-3 minutes! Despite an empty restaurant the fish tacos for me and shrimp salad for lady friend were actually pretty tasty! Server was attentive and pleasant.
November 15, 2013|Exquisite|5|McCormick and Schmick's really made my trip to Rhode Island spectacular. The food was delicious; but the service was even more outstanding. Colette guided us to a wonderful table and checked in throughout the evening and was very professional. The bartender Marsha made some amazing wine recommendations as well. She was very friendly and polite. Christina - who wasn't even our server - made several nightlife recommendations and even took the time to write out directions to get home faster than the way we arrived. Most importantly, I'd like to thank Abraham Reay for his candor, courtesy, and most of all being genuine. Kudos to all that made the evening memorable. Many thanks, Alan Kensek
November 10, 2013|Professionalism|5|Professional and efficient. Our server was informed and great to talk to.The food was excellent. Thank you for having us on Vererans Day, it was a very nice gesture.
November 10, 2013|somewhat disappointing|2|"Quality of food was good...presentation fine...waiter seemed to have an ""attitude""...had to ask him for water (quite sometime after we had given our order) .also had to ask two different servers for bread (quite some time after our drink order was delivered to us)...twice the waiter came to me to clarify which of the three salmon entrees I wanted...(I wanted the one and only selection I originally had requested).....we have received better service at less noteworthy restaurants...I might add that the restaurant was not very busy during our visit (reservations originally for 5:45...we arrived about 4:15 and asked if we could be accomodated without a problem).........we would not rush back"
November 10, 2013|Outstanding service and really|5|Outstanding service and really good food.I went to your restaurant for the Veterans Day Meal along with my lady friend. The food was great, the service was even better, I am sorry I do not remember the young lady's name (bad memory). She was working on November 10, 2013 at 3 PM. . Being a veteran and a former Marine the idea of a Veterans special on the Marine Corps Birthday was more than I could resist and I thank you for this.
November 10, 2013|Great Food|5|If you want to go and get a great meal at a decent price, this is the place. Food presentation is beautiful and very good.
November 9, 2013|Disappointed|1|We were going to a concert at 8pm, made reservations for 6:15 and had to leave at 7:50 without a main course!
November 9, 2013|Longest wait ever|2|We had to wait 1h to get. Our meals and they came 15 min appart by the time everyone had their plate the first ones were already cold!
November 9, 2013|The restaurant reservation|3|The restaurant reservation system was overwhelmed or something. We were stuffed in to a table by the kitchen and our waiter gave us the excuse that the bar was backed up. It was probably just an off night, because we have never had this type of service. Our meals came out hot and delicious, but I can't rate the dinner as anything better than okay with the extra hour it took to get our dinner and drinks. The waiter did nothing wrong and you could tell everyone was hustling to keep up with demand. We would go back, just not before a concert.
November 9, 2013|Not Good for Concerts|1|"We had tickets to see Elton John at 8PM a the Dunkin Donuts Center. I thought a 6PM reservation here on Saturday night would be a great choice for a nice meal before the concert. We were finally shown to our table at 6.25PM. No waiter came to the table for at least 10-15 minutes. We decided to skip the appetizers, and immediately placed our entree orders. At about 7.15PM I was beginning to get worried so I asked the waitress to check on our order. A manager came to the table at 7.25PM to let us know that the kitchen was a ""little"" behind. I said ""little""? After some discussion she admitted they were a ""lot"" behind. We ended up rushing our entrees, and it was a totally unpleasant experience. Not to mention the complete lack of an apology."
November 9, 2013|Our waiter was poor at best|1|Our order was wrong so the waiter took it back after 10 minutes the same food came back and was left for us telling us that they were working for us to fix the issue we finished eating and the the lobster tails that we were missing arrived cold and half missing I ordered another drink which arrived after we finished eating and we're ready to leave once I told the waiter I didn't want it we never say him again. We sat for 15 minutes or more wait ing for our check Still no waiter. Finally another waitress got our check and chased us out I tipped her for going out of her way to help us. Poor poor service
November 9, 2013|McCormick & Schmick's Seafood RI|5|The food was excellent tasting, great service from our server and they had a very good Wine list. The place was clean and very comfortable the menu was excellent . I would return there again.
Dined on October 26, 2013|Super place for a special night out|5|Come for a night out to celebrate. What a great place to go for super food, great service and fantastic drinks. We loved everything. The drinks were super good - I got the Prosecco sangria and it was amazing. I had to have another. My boyfriend asked for a blueberry lemonade with vodka and loved his specialty drink as well. The shrimp kisses appetizer - great. I had the king crab legs and they were sweet as could be! My boyfriend had the 6 oz sirloin and loved it. We were saddened that the specialty dessert - the chocolate sack was sold out. Our waiter was prompt, effecient and personable. He found time to make a persona connection in a way that was just right. We will return.
October 12, 2013|Average|2|I found the food and service to be only fair. Definitely, not worth the price. There are many excellent restaurants in RI and this is not one of them.
October 11, 2013|Decent Dinner; great dessert!|4|My wife and I started with the clam chowder. Chowder was flavorful, but a bit salty. For entree, I had the Chilean Sea Bass off of the Fall specials menu. While the fish was flaky and flavorful, the apple miso had too much of an acidic taste for me and the cabbage was more of a kale-like leaf. Desserts were the highlight of the day. My son had the strawberry shortcake, my wife the flourless cake, and I had the creme brulee. Each was a perfect finishing touch. The staff was awesome and were the stars of our dining experience! Kudos to them! Likely won't be back aside from another special occasion because the quality of food we ate could be had from many other seafood places in RI.
October 5, 2013|Providence Foodie says No|2|"The overall experience here was just mediocre. Food was good..certainly not great.. and too expensive for what we had; service felt rushed like the server had too many tables. There are just too many really good restaurants in Providence to even bother with M&S again. (Having lived in Orlando before, there ""used"" to be a M&S there at the Mall at Millennia...its no longer there... I guess I know why if all M&S are the run the same way.)"
October 4, 2013|Always great food and service|5|Have been to McCormick and Schmidt a number of times. And I always have good service and good food. This time kept to appetizers. salads and wine. Still very good
September 28, 2013|Good food and good service|4|Booked using open table and they sat us right when we walked in. Had a very friendly waiter that made sure we were comfortable and had a good time. My salmon was very flavorful but a little over cooked, the tuna appetizer was wonderful.
September 21, 2013|Very dissapointed|2|My sister and I had been to the McCormick and Schmicks in Cincinatti, Oh and loved it. We couldn't wait to dine at this one in Providence, however we realized quickly it was very different. Our appetizer of stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon were so dry they were almost in edible, the tilapia with butter rum sauce that we had in Cincinatti that was sooo delicious was terrible.! The tilapia tasted like it had been marinated in jalapeño juice and the butter rum sauce had no flavor. Also the server was kind of snooty and the atmosphere wasn't near as upscale as we had previously experienced...
September 21, 2013|great but slow|4|The food was really good. The service was really good in that the staff was polite, but they were very slow. We kept having to hunt down our server to ask her for something - can we have water, can we see the dessert menu, can we have the check, etc. Other than that it was great!
September 21, 2013|Disapointed|2|We decited to go to M&S for my son's 18th birthday. After Spending over $50.00 per person for dinner we all felt that we could have done much better at a longhorn or other chain. Very disapointed.............
September 21, 2013|Great steak and lobster!|4|"The waitstaff were excellent, from the moment we were greeted at the door (with a ""happy anniversary"" greeting once I gave them my name) to the personal recommendations of our waiter ( and happy anniversary greetings again)."
September 19, 2013|Lunch in Providence|4|Very nice restaurant with excellent service. Food was good and the seafood was excellent.. We were a party of five and sat down at 3:45 P.M for the luncheon.
September 15, 2013|Minor glitches but a nice meal|4|"Terrific service, seafood. All very good through the meal, but dessert was disappointing. Chocolate expresso cake was very stale. Had it before and it is dry between layers, but this was well beyond that. Not a huge deal. Their signature dessert is the ""chocolate bag"". My wife looks forward to this immensely, plans her calories all week, etc. They were ""out"" of it. Normally, not a big deal, but she was very disappointed and let them know this. The reason this is noteworthy is that, there was a year or so when they removed it from the menu. When we asked, they would make it for her. That tells me that it's not a long prep. But no offer was forthcoming. The place was almost empty early Sunday evening, so they had to have run out on Saturday."
September 7, 2013|beliw expecting fr/McCormicks|2|Pretty empty restaurant - and they seat a table if 6 in a booth. The service was below what I expect from McCormicks. Good was good but nothing special. We ate at a McCormicks in Virginia beach the week before and it was a 10, the Providence location was a 5
September 7, 2013|Waiter|4|I have eaten at other locations. Food is always exceptional. This experience was different only because the server wad pretty rude. It seemed as if it was a bother for him to be our waiter. Maybe he was just having a bad day. Happens to all of us I guess
August 11, 2013|Good food|5|Had a lovely dinner food was excellent. Service very good. Relaxing atmosphere. Noise level low which is a big plus for me Can't wait to go again
August 10, 2013|Good, but rushed|3|McCormick & Schmick's delivers excellent food in a really nice venue. The service was rushed and brisk, but it was a busy night with WaterFire going on. Great restaurant, pretty good value, indifferent service.
August 8, 2013|Good Food- nice atmosphere|3|I was a bit surprised by the increase in pricing- but the food was still very good. The service was fine, but we had to ask for more bread which he never brought. Also, didn't find the answer to another question. It was a slow night (Thursday) so there was really no excuse. Additionally, I had requested a window table in the on-line reservation. They seated us at an interior table when window tables were available. So the service people could be better trained.
August 7, 2013|The food was delicious but|2|The food was delicious but the service spotty. Many items needed to be requested two or three times. Getting the check (and getting it corrected took a half hour. We all enjoyed the dishes we ordered but getting everything right was the problem.
August 4, 2013|We had a family gathering.|2|We had a family gathering. We were one of only a few folks in the restaurant and the food took a long time to come out. In addition we had 3 kids under 5 and their meals were the last to come out. For the price I would not recommend.
July 29, 2013|Not what I thought|2|This place is not what I thought. Very different to others iv been to. The restaurant itself wasn't very clean. The food was Just okay nothing to write home about. I thought for the prices I was going to be getting something along the lines of Capitol grille or Cafe Nuovo and I didn't. Bartender was friendly but a corporate style manager lurking around making what should be a nice relaxed lunch atmosphere a little awkward. They need to work on the crab tower and maybe a good steam clean of the place would help.
July 27, 2013|Excellent food, average service|3|Thumbs up for the shrimp cocktail, mussles and wild Alaskan Salmon; however, service left much to be desired. The mashed potatoes were luke warm and appeared to be a combination of instant and real potatoes. Our water glasses were never re-filled and no one asked if anyone wanted a refill on the coffee. Dessert too drew mixed reviews. The cheesecake got a thumbs up, however, the strawberry shortcake was inedible. I have dined @ other locations in Washington, DC and Chicago and have not been disappointed.. So this first visit to this location was a surprising disappointment.
July 19, 2013|open table problem|5|My friend and I dined at McCormick and schmitts Friday evening. I booked the reservation using open table Upon arrival we were told we had no reservation We had copy of the confirmation information .fortunately the restaurant could seat us. told us this is a common occurrence w them and open table reservation system Beware using open table for use may derail your dinner plans!!!
July 18, 2013|Good Experience|4|My friend & I took advantage of Restaurant Week and had a really nice dinner from the fixed price menu!
July 13, 2013|Amazing!|5|Enjoyed several glasses of nice crisp refreshing pinot grigio. Food is delicious. Started w/ calamari app which was excellent. Then steak & lobster tail meal w/ the sauteed wild mushrooms side & I cannot tell you how incredible it was. Literally almost a scene from When Harry met Sally while I was enjoying this. I made such delicious noises while eating it that I was embarrassed after my plate was cleared away. In fact we decided we better leave after that & decline dessert . Definitely recommend this dish. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Atlantic salmon chef special dish as well, great flavor in the meal & specifically the sauce w/ it (a soy based sauce). Definitely an amazing meal. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone...
July 13, 2013|Food and service were mediocre.|2|Food and service were mediocre. Have been to M&S before (in Boston)--this was the first time it felt like a chain...
July 13, 2013|Waterfire & Rest. Wk. & Sat. Night!|4|$5 valet parking for 3 hrs. Only if u don't leave the premises. OK $16 because we took a 1/2 hr. walk to Waterfire. 7 pm reservation=7:30 table. Ok. We're told RW promo is not available Friday or Saturday! Really? Then put it on the website like the other restaurants do with their restrictions. We're able to order from the promo menu only becuz we had seen it at the bar. Sean our waiter was great and the food was excellent which made up for the shaky start. Nice place but lots of competition in the area so not outstanding in any way.
July 13, 2013|Not worth it|2|The food's okay, but not worth the price. The service leaves a lot to be desired. Go to Fleming's instead.
July 4, 2013|Food delayed.....many dishes not av|2|Two or three fish were sold out by 7:45 pm on Saturday evening. The food came very late - the wait was inordinate. The manager did come by to apologize.
July 4, 2013|Not the best|3|This is the second McCormick and Schmick's I've been to in the last month. I won't go to another. The food was good, but the portions were very small. It was on July 4th, so maybe that had something to do with quantities on hand at the restaurant. My son had Cod and I had Flounder. The portions were ridiculously small for the price.
June 27, 2013|Great Lunch!|4|I had the salmon over asian salad...it was awesome!
June 22, 2013|"Saturday June 22, 2013
Overall"|2|Saturday June 22, 2013 Overall the food was well prepared. The calamari appetizer was very good! Our issue was with our service. We had to ask numerous times for items that should have been delivered within minutes of seating. It seemed like our server wanted to be someplace else.
June 20, 2013|Always good|4|Been here many times love it. had the tuna app, and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Came with seared tuna and won tons on one side, and a soy soaked tuna sashimi over avocado on the other side. for our meals, we had the fish and chips, which were good and the blackened mahi mahi with mashed potato. The mahi mahi was firm and had just a hint of spice. was very good and we will be back
June 14, 2013|Oysters 101|3|The oysters although delicious were only schucked on one side so I had to scrape them off of the shell. My scallops had one of the feet still attached.A prep no no They were out of the only Chablis they had on the wine list.
June 8, 2013|OK, but....|3|"Arrived to find they didn't have my open table reservation, but seated us quickly as the place wasn't busy for a Saturday night. Service was very good. Food was good, but the real issue was portions vs. price. VERY overpriced for what you receive. I ordered grilled rainbow trout and received only a half of a thin fillet for $20. All other meals were the same way, good but hardly worth what they charged. I was also surprised to ""local"" fish specials,(no swordfish??!!) very strange for a seafood restaurant that says it specializes in local fish. I would not recommend to anyone who is hungry, but if you are willing to pay top dollar for small bites you probably will enjoy."
June 8, 2013|Special Night|3|Management went out of their way to make it a special night as it was our anniversary .The presentation of the food and the amount of food for the dollar amount was very disappointing. Had difficult time getting the filet prepared per or order.
June 8, 2013|Wouldn't go back|2|"Four of us went before going to Trinity. First of all the dining room was extremely warm. We asked our server, Kaitlyn, if she could put the a/c on...a manager came over and explained they were having problems but it would cool off soon. It never did! The chowder was good. My friend and I ordered the lump crab ""tower"". It was good but was more like a small cake (like a crab cake)...definitely not a tower. Two of us ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was good, but our sticky rice was cold and crunchy! We told Kaitlyn, she apologized and about 20 mns. later returned with warm rice for us which was not seasoned. Also the green beans had to be sent back because they were overdone. The coffee was old and we couldn't drink it. Kaitlyn was a good server."
June 7, 2013|Horrible experience|1|We went to celebrate our anniversary. Waiter was not attentive. We ordered spinach and mushrooms as a appetizer, and salmon as our main course. After a 50 minute wait EVERYTHING was served together. There was NO spinach in our appetizer. When we mentioned this to our waiter, he grabbed the mushrooms off the table, and returned 25 minutes later with the correct order. We wanted this as an appetizer not a dessert. Also, the size of the salmon was undersized. The portions were 4 oz. or less.. At $25 a plate we overpaid. Fish was at least cooked correctly.. When I got back to my hotel room I reviewed the check and discovered the waiter had charged us $7.99 instead of the listed price of $5.99 for the spinach.
June 1, 2013|The service and the food was|5|The service and the food was great. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass for the time and it was delicious.
May 31, 2013|Great Meal|5|This is a great place to grab a nice meal! Food was excellent, as was the service.
May 26, 2013|Not as good as other M & S location|3|Soggy calamari, overly-baconed chowder. Flavor combo on flatbread didn't work. Too much oil/fat/salt for me.
Dined on May 21, 2013|Wonderfully fresh seafood, relaxing|4|If you enter through the restored Biltmore lobby, you get the traditional feel immediately. The dark wood of the dining room and bar area gives you the clubby ambiance of an old eatery. We were initially seated close to the bar which was noisy, but were readily accommodated when we asked for a quieter table. Our server respected our desire for a leisurely meal and was attentive, but not overbearing. The food was delicious, including the chowder and the wonderfully fresh oysters. Entrees off the special and regular menus were nicely presented and very fresh! The only down side was that our leisurely meal lasted more than the 3 hr free valet parking, so we had to pay $15 to park! That made an expensive evening, just a little more so!
May 18, 2013|Frankly nothing memerable|2|Frankly nothing memerable about the meal that I had whci was baked cod. Portions were small. I have eaten at the Atlanta location several times (Last April 2011) and that was fine. Would not plan on goig to Providnece location agian.
May 18, 2013|Missing the mark|3|"I know they're a chain, but a high-end chain, and I expected the service and food to be, at the very least, adequate. Our waiter was very nice, slightly sales-y, but nice none the less. We order as an appetizer the ""Rhode Island-Style"" calamari, which were oddly bland. We each ordered our entrees plus a couple of sides for the table. The entrees came out, except my husband's steak didn't have the sauce he ordered - and despite mentioning more than once that our sides were not there - they finally came out as we were almost done eating. We still were charged for our late sides, even though it was the manager who solved the issue. It was as if they trained their wait staff on 'selling up' but not serving. We don't plan to go back."
May 17, 2013|Good food - poor service|3|The food we very good but the service was poor - we had to ask to have our water glasses full, they were later bringing out the bottle of wine and brought the bread after the appetizer. I have eaten McCormick & Schmick's Seafood in other locations and always had great service. I was very surprised by the service levels at the Providence location. The food was very good.
May 17, 2013|Had a great dinner before|5|Had a great dinner before a show in Providence. Everything was excellent.
May 12, 2013|Mother's Day brunch disaster|2|Went there for Mother's Day and didn't expect a brunch crammed into a small hallway. They didn't restock the food and plates in time to accommodate everyone. Our waitress took forever to bring us drinks/refills. Not worth the money for what I spent.
May 11, 2013|Average but good|3|We went because my husband loved the one in Kanas City when he lived there. The menu wasnt exactly the same as he remembered, used to list the foods just brought in for the day, but it is neat they change the menu out daily! He enjoyed his King Crab legs, my meal was also very good. The restaurant might need some updating, seemed kind of dated. The only real complaint was that we got clams and they all had slivered pieces of shell in them, like they were not schucked well.
May 11, 2013|Wonderful Mother's Day dinner|4|"I am so happy we chose McCormick $ Schmidts to end a day at the ballet and celebrate mother's day early. Our waiter was cordial and knowledgable. We began with tale appetizers of calamari with banana peppers and stuffies. The calamari was excellent, but we found the stuffies with bacon a little salty, more like a casino than a traditional stuffie. Dinner did not disappoint! We ordered the seared scallops with spinach crab hash brown and potato pesto, and left nothing to lick, grilled salmon ""perfectly done"" , stuffed salmon with crab and brie, another winner and the Palm Beach Mahi Mahi (I would order it again in a heartbeat). Dessert, Creme Brule and Chocolate Expresso cake was spectacular and huge."
April 24, 2013|"Great Seafood for a ""chain"""|4|We had great food and exceptional service at McCormick and Schmick's in Providence. A great wine list and plenty of variety. Landry's restaurants always come through for great seafood.
April 23, 2013|Disappointing|3|Very disappointed this is called a seafood restaurant. Was out for a business meal, and my clients could not order what they wanted. No lobster, only lobster tail and those had been previously frozen. I did not realize when I made the reservation that it was a chain. I guess then location doesn't matter. Being on the coast I assumed their seafood would be fresh. Lesson learned.

April 14, 2013|Great Birthday Restaurant|5|I took my boyfriend out for his 50th birthday. We had a wonderful experience from the printing on the menus(which we were able to take home) to the Happy Birthday dessert. Our waitress, Ann, was amazing and the food was to die for.
April 4, 2013|Good restaurant but not great|3|We were a bit underwhelmed. Expected better for this range of restaurant. Some of the food was great (chicken), but some not so much (chowder, calamari) and the rest was just OK. Our waiter was very enthusiastic at first, then as the meal went on, she tended to be a bit much. Table and ambiance was ok, but it was at least not next to the loud bar crowd. Overpriced for what we experienced.

March 26, 2013|Not typical Landry's-quality|3|"The food underwhelmed me and the service was sub-par. We had a table for seven which automatically included an 18% tip. That is OK for Outback but tasteless for upscale restaurants IMHO. Even so I would expect for a large party with a guaranteed tip there should be two servers but not here. First, not all of the place settings were complete. Second, the server completely forgot to take my order (he skipped me completely). I ordered the Ultimate Mixed Grill. Well let me say that there was nothing ultimate about this dish. It looked like more a sample appetizer (two pieces of four items from the menu). Believe me, I understand portion control. I wan't expecting a ""Buca di Beppo"" platter full of fish but ""Ultimate""? Really? C+"
March 12, 2013|McCormick and Schmick was Terrible!|1|The service was terrible. LONG waits in between courses. Bread and butter kept passing our table, served to other tables and never to ours. Our water glasses were left empty through most of the meal. Finally when we were 90 percent done, we each got a half-glass of water. The food was quite good, but sadly the tiny portions would have fit into a thimble. For the prices charged, you just ought to get more food. It was a rip off! We will NEVER go back!
March 9, 2013|Don't bring your appetite!|2|EAT BEFORE YOU GO!!!!!Smallest portions I've ever been served; drinks tasted like strictly juice.What a disappointment to bring someone for their birthday and to leave hungry! How embarassing! NEVER AGAIN!!!

March 5, 2013|Great seafood!|4|I love their raw bar - really fresh, large seafood selection. I recommend going there during their happy hour ($1 oysters!!!!)
March 1, 2013|Not worth the price. Not sure|2|Not worth the price. Not sure if I would return. Shark was over rated for the price. Server recommended it. Maybe because most expensive item on menu. Should have stuck with the steak it looked better. Cappuccino was very watered down sent it back. Apple pie was very good.
March 1, 2013|Great dinner but NOT in the bar!|4|"We have been to McCormick and Shmicks several times and always enjoy the food. The wait staff is generally pretty good, however, the bartenders are rude and will not make eye contact with you until they are ready. We have stood at the bar for fifteen minutes before a bartender acknowledged us and then it was just to say "" I'll be with you in a minute""! We live downtown and will only go to M&S for dinner, never for appetizers or drinks."
February 26, 2013|Not as Good as Expected|3|We were a bit underwhelmed. Expected better, having gone to the M & S in Faneuil Hall, Boston, a few times in the past. Some of the food was great (raw bar items, cheesecake and wedge salad), but some not so much (chowder, King crab legs) and the rest was just OK (cod, swordfish entrees). Our waiter was very enthusiastic at first, then as the meal went on, he tended to ignore us. We had asked for a romantic table ahead of time as it was our anniversary, but got seated in the noisiest part of the restaurant at first (next to the bar area) and had to ask for another, more quiet and private table. It was not necessarily a romantic table, but it was at least not next to the loud bar crowd. The place is overpriced for what we experienced.
February 19, 2013|My overall experience exceeded|4|My overall experience exceeded my expectations. The food was amazing and our server, Maureen, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible. She had a great sense of humor and she made great recommendations. Try the apple pie! It's amazing!

The Crab Tower (lump crab meat, diced mango,perfect avocado and three sauces including balsamic syrup, mango and basil) was the clear winner, although my fried oysters were perfect as was the wood grilled shrimp.

February 14, 2013|Good but not worth it.|3|Have eaten a M&S since it's opening in Prov., quality in food, preparation, service has declined last time we went. Food for the most part was pedestrian and not worth the premium priced menu. Would not recommend going there anymore as I have in the past. Service was extremely subpar, at least the waiter apologized for the inefficiency. Had to ask other waiter then ours for service.

January 27, 2013|This is not the same McCormick|2|This is not the same McCormick and Schmick's that we have been going to for the past 11 years. The menu have changed from a great one to everything ala carte. Many of the delicious menu items are gone and just plain items with much higher prices for less. The service was minimal. After this experience I will find another restaurant to celebrate the special days.

The Presentations were very pleasing and the flavors even more pleasing ...wonderful..The portions more than generous and the quality superb. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing. We started with the mixed greens and pecan salad and finished with 2x baked apple pie and 3 berry tart.Thank you, it was all much better than expected from a chain.We will be back often.
January 24, 2013|Good food, terrible service!|3|The food food was excellent! But our waitress was terrible. It was as she dint have time for our table. Brought water bottle didn't pour in glasses rushed with the wine, surprise din't just leave the bottle there too. Asked for a spoon for a pasta dish and she never came back with it until my friend was almost done with the dish. Even our hostess, was cold and not interested. She was young and her attitude was kind of uninterested in what she was doing. Would try again to see if service is better, but the prices are not cheap to get the cheap service we got.
January 24, 2013|The food and service were|4|The food and service were outstanding but the restaurant was uncomfortably cold - almost as if the heat was not working. It was a cold day outside but, even considering the age of the building, it should not have been cold inside the restaurant.

January 19, 2013|Slightly Disappointed|3|"Was a bit disappointed - expected more based on reputation. The setting was a bit dark and dingy - the booths were tall, had to wait for staff to walk by for attention. The food was good, the service excellent. But the overall value was short. We often eat at upscale restaurants and don't mind paying for excellent food and service, but what was received, was little more than OK. Ex: Coconut Shrimp Appetizer served on a trace of sauce that did not adhere to the shrimp - barely able to scrape it up. The menu implies ""a la carte"" - no hint of side items included or options - yet when the food arrived there were items not mentioned - may not have ordered extra sides or would ask for options. We would return, but now know what to expect."

January 12, 2013|The food was excellent as|3|The food was excellent as usual, but the service was awful. Our waiter rarely came around to check on us, and when he did, he seemed uninterested. At least once we were promised a wine refill and had to ask someone else for it when it didn't come. At the end of the meal, we sat with empty plates for almost 15 minutes, even though we could see our waiter in a break room across the restaurant drinking his Dunkin Donuts coffee and socializing. On top of all that, the kitchen was extremely slow - every step of the meal took far too long to come out. The restaurant was mostly empty, so being too busy is not an excuse, it was just plain bad service.
January 12, 2013|Excellent Food terrible service.|2|It is not often I take the time to write a review but after my experience at this restaurant I felt it important I shared my experience. First let me say that the food itself was excellent. Both presentation and taste was what I have come to expect from this restaurant chain. However, the service was a disaster to say the least. All made worse by the fact that our server had someone in training with them who got to see how bad the server was. Example of this was our wine arrived AFER we had eaten our meal. When I questioned why it was late I was basically told they could not find the wine. For the first time in my life I left a 10% tip. I woud certainly think twice before going back to this particular location again!

December 31, 2012|We had a great experience|4|We had a great experience there for dinner the other night. The only thing I would have to say is I had requested the best table in The house and we sat right next to the kitchen. Our waitress Marcia was great.
December 31, 2012|What a great way to end the year!|5|Always enjoy the meals here and this was no exception. Actually the steak I had was out of this world. I believe it was a 22-24oz bone-in steak that was sooo flavorful and tender that it's worthy of mentioning (and getting again and again). Added two stuffed shrimp and a side order of onion strings that topped it off for us. Did I mention my wife and friend had the same). Service was exceptionally great. Our waiter was informative and funny and if it we not for him, and his recommendation(s) we may not have enjoyed our meals as much as we did. Note: Save room for dessert! We split a chocolate espresso cake and an upside down apple pie ala mode.
December 31, 2012|Not good|1|"""Day of"" open NYE reservations should have been our first red flag. Our server was very nice, but over worked with tables. 2/4 of meals come out cold. One came back re-heated and was edible. The other, the filet, came back cold again, then came back as someone else's overcooked half eaten piece, and when we checked the last time, we were told only a few more minutes, but everyone else was done. So we dodn't have our main meal for New Years. When the bill came the waiter said the manager took money off, but he only took of 2 filets that we never got. We asked for a little something more off since that doesn't really count and were given our ""not so great oysters"" off. I would not trust them for any special ocasion again."

December 25, 2012|Superb Food|4|We chose this restaurant for Christmas because of: its reputation, proximity to our home, and was one of a very few open. Our waiter was a grump, plain and simple, he just could not put forth much effort to add to our dining experience. Ordered a second cup of coffee, it never came, had excuses when reminded. Other wait staff around us seemed exceedingly pleasant to their tables. Waiter, also, could not be hepful in accomodating a specific request on changing an entree's sauce. On a high note, the food was exceptional, from steak (out of this world) to lobster to chicken. And, save room for dessert, all three again, superb. Try the apple pie, trust me.
December 23, 2012|Scrooge would recommend this place.|5|My family (all adults) looks forward to our post-theater visits to McCormick & Schmicks, this last time did not disappoint. Sunday evening atmosphere was quiet and friendly, Waitstaff (Christopher, et al) provided outstanding recommendations and service, food (from appetizers to dessert) met all our expectations. Steaks were cooked to perfection, seafood was excellent and desserts (Upside-down Apple pie/Chocolate Expresso cake) were raved about days after.
December 15, 2012|I have eaten here over the|3|I have eaten here over the past couple of years and feel that it has lost some of its appeal. Definitely not as good as I remember. The fish was just okay. The sides were incredibly bland. I had lunch at the restaurant and returned the next day for dinner because it was close to the theater. I was hoping it would be better for dinner. It wasn't.

November 11, 2012|Server Puts a Damper on Dinner|3|Inattentive, inexperienced server incorrectly described the dish I had ordered (based on her description). While looking at the drink menu I ordered an iced tea and instead of the drink, she brought a non-alcoholic iced tea. I asked her what time she had started that day and she said 8 a.m. whereupon I asked how she could be so incorrect in her description of the dish after having been on duty from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. A pot of hot water was brought without a tea selection. By the time the tea came (almost empty box) it was necessary to ask for more hot water since it was no longer hot enough for proper brewing. She subsequently became a nuisance approaching with excuses while our mouths were full. Sweet girl but lacking.
November 11, 2012|Everyone can enjoy|4|Food is always excellent! A nice selectio nwith a slightly odern twist, but still quite traditional. Everyone should find a menu item that is perfect. Their salads are wonderful. This reminds me of the way restaurant used to be--great service and variety.It is more than just getting something to eat. It is an experience.
November 11, 2012|My daughter and I were there|5|My daughter and I were there for the Veterans day dinner. I severed for twenty years. I love that you give back to the community. I want to thank you for a special day. Its nice to explain to my daughter that leaving her was not for nothing but for everyone. The food was amazing and the service just as amazing. We had the lobster bisque and the presentation was wonderful. I can't say enough. thank you and we will see you soon. Pamela Chambers
November 11, 2012|Food was good quality and|3|Food was good quality and well prepared. Bill was incorrect in that one of the entrees was charged as a dinner instead of a lunch (my party and I were there for lunch). Fried oysters were no longer available. East Matuneck Oyster Bar is your competition
November 10, 2012|I was not impressed with waiting|2|I was not impressed with waiting 20 minutes to be attended to by a waiter. No water. No drinks. Nada. Food was ok, drinks less than perfect. My cosmo had chunks of ice that might choke a small horse.

October 20, 2012|The restaurant space was attractive|4|The restaurant space was attractive and the food was pretty good. I especially liked the vegetables, which are often the sign of a good restaurant. My fish was so-so; a little dry. One of our party got their salad but they seemed to have forgotten the other two, so we waited for some time before the waiter realized this. He did, however, apologize before we had to bring it to his attention. The waiter was also more talkative than usual, which was a little unusual.
October 14, 2012|I would have assumed that|2|I would have assumed that they would have served bread or rolls with the meal or cheese and crackers with the wine we had. Felt unusual to just sit drinking wine while we waited for our meal. Ruth Chris and Flemmings do provide, for free, a nice hot small loaf of bread and I believe we got some small crackers with our wine. This is where we usually eat, and where we will eat in the future. It looked as though the food had sat under a heat lamp. We had the lobstertail/steak special. Origionally 6 of us were going to late lunch on Sunday but the other 4 had a conflict arise just before I booked the reservations.
October 13, 2012|We asked for our money back|1|We asked for our money back at the end of the meal. Food was cold, overpriced, poorly prepared and dissapointing. The manager gave us our money back but I still would not go again. It was a waste of time.
October 12, 2012|The service was excellent,|4|The service was excellent, but while the food was acceptable, the portions seemed small and I thought a bit-overpriced for what was delivered. But it was a very good environment for a large group and everyone had a good time.
October 7, 2012|Stay away!|2|Beware of the steak and lobster dinner -- the portions of each are microscopic even though the pictures show large portions. Service was pleasant but inexperienced and our waiter messed up two of our party's orders. By the time the corrected food came out, everyone else had finished their dinners. I would not recommend or return. For the relatively high prices they charge, none of this should have happened.
October 5, 2012|Good service but let down|3|Good service but let down by the quality of the food. The salad lettuce was old and browning on the edges. Fish and chips came with the chips heavily salted such that they could not be eaten. The steamed vegetables were coated in oil.
September 29, 2012|Menu descriptions lacking|2|Decor and service were fine. Menu descriptions are sparse. Ordered chopped salad with blue cheese & bacon -came covered with shaved parmesan & green olives too (Hate olives). Entree was Cajun BBQ shrimp, 5 small shrimp were ok -largest component of meal was a pile of gritty swiss chard piled with sausage pieces (Hate sausage) and a dry biscuit. Thought I was ordering a Seafood meal, no mention of sausage in description. Dessert was better, asked ahead if chocolate mousse was chocolate (no, it was mocha) Who writes this menu? The chocolate truffle dessert was good except for the burnt crust. It was filled with nuts, which I do like, but I think people would like to know if a menu item contained nuts or not.

September 15, 2012|We've dined here several times|2|"We've dined here several times and have usually been satisfied. This time, we were somewhat disappointed. Service: We ordered a bottle of white wine and he brought us glasses of wine. He took those back and brought the bottle. We had to request a bottle chiller. We had to request our bread a couple of times before we finally flagged down another server. One of us ordered the ""fresh swordfish"" offering. I seriously doubt if the portion was 8 oz. At 29.00, I would expect a 10 to 12 oz portion. Desserts-very good. However, on our last visit we were told the capuccino machine was temp out of order. We were told the same thing this time. Why is there an issue with an espresso machine?"
September 13, 2012|Disappointed|2|Food was very heavy (and greasy). Service was attentive. Food came out (almost too) quickly. Too expensive. Will not go again to this particular location
Dined on September 9, 2012|Two of us had the steak and|3|Two of us had the steak and lobster special. My personal opinion was that the lobster was overcooked. The service was poor and our waitress smelled of cigarette smoke when she approached our table. Our cocktails arrived after the appetizer and we very slow in arriving at our table. The management did notice that we had waited a long time for the cocktails and they were offered to us at no cost. The meal did not live up to the expectations that I have always had at McCormick & Schmick's.
September 8, 2012|Menu no longer lists where|2|Menu no longer lists where the daily fish was caught, which we miss. Our mussels appetizer included quite a few mussels which did not open, thus inedible...very disappointing. Main courses (Palm Beach Mahi Mahi & Baked Cod) very nicely presented and very tasty.

August 25, 2012|I enjoyed the night. It was|3|I enjoyed the night. It was my birthday and surprised after I mentioned it to the waitor a candle was not placed in my apple pie as I had seen done at a table earlier that evening. The food was very good, however the coffee with dessert was not and this is what I remember. The decaf. tasted distinctly like instant. BLAH!!! I wouldn't pay the extra money to go back to a fine dining establishment where the coffee is way better at Chelo's, Dunkin Donuts or McDonalds.
August 22, 2012|Consistant as usual|5|Been there before and will return. Visited the city to see a play and McCormick & Schmick's has always been good, here and in other states. Will return, food always great and the waitress & manager were very exceptionally pleasant and helpful.

July 29, 2012|What a great dinner!|5|We wanted good seafood and looked for a place that had that as a main component of its menu. McCormick & Schmick's was a wonderful place! Our waitress Maureen was attentive and accomodating. The oysters from the oyster bar were delicious and the calamari with the banana peppers excellent. Our salads and soups were great (my friends lobster bisque was out of this world!). All of our meals were cooked just right and served hot. our waitress told my friend that the salmon rigatoni was a big meal in itself and not to get any salad or soup if he wanted to finish it. even though he followed her suggestion he still took home a good portion of his meal. The desserts were very nice as well. There was no Waterfire that night so it was quiet.
July 27, 2012|food yummy, service so-so|4|i made my reservation at 7:30 for an 8:30 table. We were seated at a lovely booth. However, it was next to the bar, so it was very noisy. The server was polite but the service was just okay. The waiter came and took our order, but never came to check on us during our meal. He didn't offer any more water, or another glass of wine. He forgot the hot sauce, we had to ask another server.The food was terrific. The walnut salad was fresh and well coated, the clam chowder was delicious, and the salmon rigatoni was divine.
July 25, 2012|We'll be back|5|We stayed overnight at the Biltmore so we stopped in the bar for quick snacks during happy hour, then to dinner. and then to breakfast the next morning. On all three occasions, the food was delicious. We were surprised at how ample the small plates were and how reasonably priced. Our waitress Christina (sp?) took very good care of us. Then the dinner was terrific, the hostess was very flexible when we had to change both the number in our party and the time of arrival. Everyone enjoyed their meals and our waitress was knowledgeable and cooperative. As people who dine out frequently, we were very pleased with the food choices and the quality of the dinners. Breakfast the next day again was reasonably priced, well served and generous.
July 21, 2012|Food was good but service|2|Food was good but service was incredibly slow. They were also unwilling to compromise when the dish I ordered ran out and they didn't tell us until 30 minutes after we ordered an appetizers were already eaten.
July 21, 2012|This used to be my favorite|2|This used to be my favorite restaurant in Providence. Every trip we knew we would stop in. The seafood was fresh and the preparation was top notch. Service used to be impecable, the ambience great. As it should be for the prices charged. This time it felt tired and rundown. The menu was just average and the food was very slow to arrive. Portions were small. One of the dishes (bbq shrimp) was way over salted and inedible. The waiter offered to talk to the manager but ultimately no remedy was offered. A piece of stained glass in the chandelier was missing and another misplaced. Minor details but seemed consistent with the rest of the experience this time. We are in no hurry to go back.
July 21, 2012|What a terrible evening-we|1|What a terrible evening-we waited for at least an hour and 1/2 for food because of Water Fire. They really had a hard time handling the volume associated with that event. Would avoid going here during Water Fire.
July 21, 2012|Servers and Kitchen Out of Sync|3|I wish I could say that my dining experince was great as me and my wife were celebrating our 3rd Anniversay; however, the service was slow, and the kitchen was not in sync with the staff. First, we got our main course 5 minutes after we got our appetizers. Second, they tried to give us the main course again. As we were just finishing the main course, they asked if we had gotten our appetizers as they had a bowl of lobster bisque waiting. We ordered dessert, which took about 35 minutes or so and when we got the bill, they tried to charge us for 2 main courses! After lengthy negotiations, we were able to get our extra parking taken care of (we were there for more than 3 hours) and dessert, we paid and got out...there are better places!
July 21, 2012|Service started out well,|2|Service started out well, then it was busy at the restaurant. Ordered a bottle of wine to have with dinner and we were finished with dinner when the waitress said that the bottle had to be cooled and that it was suppose to be delivered to our table. We canceled the order for wine. It took three requests for our water glasses to be filled. When we received the bill, we had someone else's drinks added to the bill. We will not go back.
July 20, 2012|Stayed at the Providence Biltmore|4|Stayed at the Providence Biltmore and made reservations for this restaurant out of convenience. What a surprise. It was our best dining experience in Providence! Food was great and the service was exceptional. Our waiter went above and beyond. He doubled as a Providence tour guide in directing us to places to see around the city. Highly recommend.

May 19, 2012|Everything was good, service|4|Everything was good, service was good, though at times the waiter talked a bit more than he should have. I do have one question, when we ordered wine we wanted a J Lohr cab, and were told there were no bottles left. So we ordered 3 bottles of Coppola Cabernet for dinner, and the first two bottles came OPEN when brought to the table. The third bottle was opened in front of us. I have never experienced that before, even in less upscale restaurants. I did not ask why because it was our son's graduation dinner and I did not want to upset him with what he would perceive as a compliant. Could you tell me why this was done? My only thought is that unfinished bottles were consolidated and then given to us.
May 19, 2012|The waiter was too comfortable|1|The waiter was too comfortable and in our business including our conversation. He was slow and unimpressive in food knowledge and/or service.
May 18, 2012|Disappointing|2|Went to M&S Friday night. We had a reservation, and were seated right away. The restaurant was lively, but not slammed. There were many open tables and the bar was only about half full. Once we sat down, things went downhill fast. We waited a really long time for our server. Placed a drink and appetizer order. Drinks took forever, and we were halfway through our appetizer before they arrived. The appetizers were just okay. Calamari was kind of dry, and portion was small. When we finally received our drinks (martinis), they were served in snifters. Got our main courses and again, they were just okay. Bill was $270 for the four of us. Could have spent less somewhere else and gotten a much better meal. I doubt we will return anytime soon.
May 17, 2012|Nothing Special|2|We attended McCormick & Schmick's Seafood restaurant to celebrate a graduation. There were 6 of us in the party, all adults and 4 of them drove from NY to attend this event. My boyfriend and I were embarrassed of the service and food we received. First I will say the restaurant was not busy or full. Every time we ordered a round of drinks it took over 20 min before we got them. The fire alarm went off (for a long time) because of a dish brought out from the kitchen. Our calamari was extremely salty, and no ones meal was exceptionally good. We spent a lot of money (the bill came to $400.00)!! The waitress did not make an effort to give us extra attention or speed up our service. Sadly, we will not be attending this restaurant again.

May 13, 2012|Mother's Day is difficult|2|Mother's Day is difficult for restaurants because everyone goes out for brunch with their mom. I felt that there wasn't really much of an array of food for the price and there were very few desserts. I wouldn't bother to go again and was disapointed. Mimosas were $8.00. The service was painfully slow, drinks tooks a long time and I had to remind my server to bring over our truffles. The setup of the room was also hard to manuver.

We have been going to M&S for many years and will continue to do so. Some disappointments are that they no longer let you know where the fish products come from and if they are wild caught. I wish they had more information, it is important to us. Would certainly recommend and have on several occasions taken others for the 1st time to M&S. Enjoy

April 7, 2012|Nice ambiance and very good|2|Nice ambiance and very good service but overpriced for the portions served. One of us had the seared sea scallops for $29 but there were only three of them. My stuffed Atlantic salmon was very tasty for $27, but again the portion was relatively sparse. So, although the food was well prepared, I do not consider this to be a good value for your money.
April 6, 2012|Great pairing of flavors.|4|Great pairing of flavors. My Mahi mahi with corn and crab was excellent. Recreated cajun cream sauce for radish greens at home. Our server was a bit over eager, but very expedient. If it was in the budget, we would visit again soon. Nice for a special occasion. Reservations were easy to make and we got right in. Desserts great too. We got the chocolate trio. creme brule amazing with cayenne Mexican twist!

We were looking forward to some really good Fish and Chips but I suppose we will have to try another place after visiting here. The fish was plentiful but the batter was very greasy/oily, not good. The fries were OK but were a bit cold. Not good food, sorry. They need to improve if they are to tout themselves as a good seafood restaurant! Good Luck.
March 2, 2012|Interestingly, we went to|3|Interestingly, we went to M&S two Fridays in a row, had exactally the same meals and the second time they were 50% less than the irst time. The Parm encrsted Sole had two pieces one week(probably too much) ond one the second. My Cod looked lost on my plate.Odd! Both were very good, just a little stingy after the over abundance of the previous occasion. Other places in easy walk pf Trinity Theatre have not taken into consideration that many Rhode Islanders eat fish on Fridays at this time of year.

My wife ordered the sea scallops which were complimented with a nice mustard creme sauce. I ordered the lobster ravioli which had nice portions of lobster scattered throughout the plate. My rating of a 2 for service were for numerous reasons. I had called the restaurant earlier in the day to ask them to make some accommodations for my wife's birthday. Unfortunately neither of those accommodations were completed. Ouservices never introduced himself , We had to request water for the table, our server actually disappeared for 10 minute after handing us the desert menus with the excuse that he was also in charge of room service!! I'd write more but can't fit it.

November 24, 2011|A memorable Thanksgiving|5|From the moment our hostess greeted us and brought us to our table, I knew that she set the bar for a great dining experience. our waitress Maureen was terrific. She made our dinner very enjoyable and was extremely accommodating. The food was far more than we could have ever expected. Delicious turkey dinner with all the fixings and the salad and pies were also outstanding. The Biltmore has never lost that Old World class and I was so happy we chose to dine with you on Thanksgiving.

She was too hungry to send it back again so she ate half of it, which was not much. All we got was a sorry for her terrible dinner. Will not go back. (On a positive note, my regular sized filet came out perfect).

I made a reservation for Sunday, November 13th and thought we'd have a romantic dinner on the town. The food was abominable. The crab had turned on the Blue Crab Tower, the cod dish was surrounded by a creamed corn that had a film over it, the lobster mashed had pieces of lobster over the top that had been microwaved out of the shell - the claw meat was like taffy. The dessert of strawberry cheesecake rolls seemed like old berries chopped with coagulated milk and deep fried in a soggy wrap, supposed to come with dipping sauces - omitted.

We usually shy away from national chains but I feel they have transcended any negatives and we feel we are at a local fish restaurant. Fish always Freash and local. We're always happy here.....
November 4, 2011|Nothing Special|3|We were at M&S for an early pre-show dinner so the dining room was fairly empty. My Bloody Mary was one of the weakest I've ever had, pretty much tomato juice and ice. The chopped salad with bacon and blue cheese was outstanding. However our entrees arrived within 5 minutes of getting our salads :( I had the combo grilled shrimp/crab cake dinner and it was OK. The shrimp were overcooked but had good flavor, crab cake was so salty I could only get through half of it. Mashed potatoes were good, green beans unremarkable. Dessert was a forgettable chocolate mousse tart and lukewarm coffee. Turns out our service was good because the table next to ours ordered 4 apps which they never got! How can you forget to serve one entire course??

All of this was perfect at M&S. Out wait staff, although in her first week, was a natural. She wore a smile and did not show any sign of being nervous, both of which are very important for me to relax.

Service was OK, waiter made a good attempt at sincere service, but food and apps were slow to come, drink refills were almost non-existant. First order or drinks had to go back and my beer was flat and stale and my wife's champagne was old and flat also. This was fixed quickly and promptly though. We are regulars there, I find it hit or miss. Parking can be a challenge, unless you use valet, meals are very tasty, very fresh, but a bit on the high side price wise and small far as portions go.
October 15, 2011|The Excuse was they were Slammed!!!|2|Service was poor from start to finish. Was ignored by wait staff. Took an hour and half to receive entree. Manager came to table to apologize which was a positive. When dinner finally came I was told they ran out of item and substituted for me. Went to this establishment as a treat and would tell others to find another restaurant. Many other restaurants on the hill out perform.

The lobster raviloi and shrimp scampi were good. The waiter was engaging but I still did not have confidence that we would make it to the theatre on time. If you are not on the clock and you have lots of money then this is place to go. I think the food is overprice for the quality.

Also the N.E. clam chowder was not the normal chowder and the best that I ever had period - not the typical creamy white rich stuff. Only negative: the courses are brought out one on top of the other: slow it down.

On most recent visit they wanted to seat us in drafty high traffic area between bar and bathroom though restaurant was mostly empty. At my request they re-set a different table, a booth in a much nicer location. The busboy used a soaked rag on the bench and I had to ask for it to be dried before we could sit on it. Service was lazy, server kept a water pitcher right on a table in the middle of section so she wouldn't have to go get one when it was needed. Dirty rumpled shirt mostly un-tucked, sloppy all around. I only go here when my usual favorites are closed.
July 31, 2011|Decent seafood, but nothing|3|Decent seafood, but nothing outstanding. Typical McCormick & Schmick's with lots of different seafood choices. Would repeat, but there are certainly better seafood places out there. Convenient to all in Providence. Waitress was very good with our children.
July 31, 2011|Very dissapointed. Made rese|1|Very dissapointed. Made rese in advance for 2 adults/1 child, still waited to be sat in empty dining room. Hostess sat us at table that wasn't fully set & gave us lunch menus at 7pm. Another party was sat less than 2ft away from my 2yr old even though restaurant was empty. Wine List was not only limited but very weak as well. Long wait for drinks, app & kids meal. Food came before we had silverware. Server forgot salad. Stuffed Salmon was lukewarm yet overcooked; served over flavorless mashed potato & steamed veggies. The Lobster Trio had alot more Crab meat than lobster and the Filet was Well Done (ordered Med Rare). No table visit from anyone, never even saw a manger in the dining room at any point to speak to. We will not be back.
July 31, 2011|Come here often, but the Sunday|4|Come here often, but the Sunday afternoon Lobster Bake special brought me here this time. We all ordered the lobster bake and it was excellent. They even peel the lobster if you want, no need to get messy. Comes with a few clams, shrimp and muscles, as well as potato and a piece of sweet corn (1/3) of an ear. Accompanied by a fresh margarita, nothing could be better.

July 24, 2011|HAD FUN|5|Had a great time and the food was great !! It was my boyfriends birthday and we had fun !!Food was excelent!!! We had the ahi tuna and lobster trio which was fantasic !!!
July 16, 2011|Delicious! Would go back!|4|We were in Providence for the Water Fire and found this restaurant nearby so we decided to give it a try. Everything we ordered was perfect and as fresh as can be. The Coconut Fried Shrimp was delicious, the lobster ravioli was very tasty, and the apple pie dessert was amazing. My boyfriend had the little neck clams and the ahi tuna entree and he was very impressed. Our wine was also excellent (2008 Spellbound Petite Sirah). He also ordered a fabulous gin and cucumber concoction. He liked it so much, he ordered two. Our server was very attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I would highly recommend this place.
July 16, 2011|Service excellent. Food -|3|Service excellent. Food - I ordered trout. Generous portion, it had a lot of bread crumbs and not a lot of flavour. Green beans were crisp, that was a good thing. Dessert of apple crisp delicious. When I dine, I am looking for exquisite seasoning, not large portion, to feel satisfied. Would I recommend this? Read my review and see if you find what you like in a meal.

Dined on July 12, 2011|Yuppy Trap|2|Food was average, absolutely nothing special considering how expensive it was. Portions left me still hungry after my meal even after an appetizer. The Rhode Island Stuffies were good but there were only three of them. The sea scallops came highly recommended but were lacking. The sauce on them was too salty and the amount of scallops the meal came with was certainly not worth 28 dollars. The atlantic stuffed salmon was alright but nothing special. Overall, I felt this restaurant specializes in ripping off yuppies who don't know any better.
July 2, 2011|The service was outstanding|5|The service was outstanding as well as the food. It was a great experience for the whole family. Kudos to M & S for showing you what a dining experience should be.
July 2, 2011|good service and very good|5|good service and very good food ...on a WaterFire Saturday, he didn't rush us or try to make us order more and more food and drinks, like it is sometimes there. the food has always been great - wished there were kumamoto oysters again - I come especially for BC or West Coast oysters - but maybe they are out of season.
June 25, 2011|Been to many M&S restaurants.|5|Been to many M&S restaurants. This one was top shelf.
June 22, 2011|Our server meant well but|1|Our server meant well but needed better training in regard to servicing the table, checking on our satisfaction and general attentiveness. The food was expensive and not a good value for the money. My wife had swordfish and while the quality was good the portion was extremely small for a 25.00 entree. Ihad trout and it was basically tasteless. Ordered a side of french fries and they were garden variety frozen natural cut potatoes, not nice fresh double fried french fries that I would expect in a good restaurant. The spinach served with thetrout was fresh and well cooked and without any seasoning, butter, olive oil, nothing.
June 18, 2011|We have visited this location|5|We have visited this location many times and have never been dissapointed. This time we brought friends with us and they were very pleased as well. Great food, great service. Not rushed. A very enjoyable evening.

June 11, 2011|Group was so happy!!|5|"Had a birthday party with a group of friends - the server was wonderful. The hostess was on her game and had our cake ready to go for us. The ONE and only problem was the cake was nasty - it was stale. It looked awesome, but tasted like the box it came in. Great for a group and the server was awesome with drinks - A+ in my book. My sister-in-law stated ""These are the best stuffies in the world."""

June 3, 2011|Our favorite restaurant in Providen|4|This is our favorite restaurant in Providence. The food is great, the location is convenient, and the service is excellent. We got $40 off the price of our meal because my mother and I received gift cards when we ate at the McCormick and Schmick's restaurant in Boston on Mother's Day. To be clear, we got the gift cards from the restaurant itself, not from a friend to be used at the restaurant. They gave the cards to all mothers who ate there on Mother's Day.

May 27, 2011|Fine Pre-Theatre Dinner|4|Crowded, noisy bar at 6:00 Friday evening which is a good thing on a summer, holiday weekend downtown. Quiet dining area, attentive server. Fish fresh, interestingl and fairly priced. Adequate wine list, maybe a dollar or two more than one would want to pay in Providence. Good location for Trinity, civic center or convention center venue. All in all we were very pleased with our pre-theatre dinner
May 21, 2011|We were cheerfully greeted,|5|We were cheerfully greeted, promptly seated and served the best meal I've had in a while. Friendly atmosphere, upbeat food server, a good time was had by all in my party. All five people in my party were served at the same time and the food was hot - a challenge a lot of restaurants don't seem to meet anymore. We made the reservation through the McCormick & Schmick website. It went off without a hitch. They were ready for us even though we showed up a little early.
May 21, 2011|Disappointing.|2|For a seafood restaurant, the best item was the potato croquette that came with my meal. In fact, we had breakfast the next morning, and again the potatoes were the star of the meal. For the amount of money I spent, I could have gone across the street to Capital Grille and had a higher quality meal, with far superior wait service. I fell for all the hype of the website and online menues and I was sorely disappointed.
May 21, 2011|Outstanding service and attention|5|"Outstanding service and attention from our waiter.. took time at the table, but did not hover~ The food was excellent, we were impressed that they would split the ""Wedge"" salad for two of the couples at the table, without us even asking.. The timing of everything was excellent.. made our Graduation Celebration even more special~"

Very nice ambiance quiet enough to talk to everyone at the table,but not too quiet. Lighting was good, we could see what we were doing without to much light. most of us had seafood,some had red meat all of us very happy with our meals.Very fresh and tasty.

May 10, 2011|Oysters & Cosmos - Great Start|4|We started with drinks in the bar and the bartender made a great cosmo. I love that they have a small oyster sampling and it is 6 oysters...all very fresh and delicious. Dinner was nice - a good filet not a melt in your mouth filet but tasty. We enjoyed it while visiting Providence for Business.
May 8, 2011|We were rather disappointed.|3|We were rather disappointed. The food quality was below the standards we've enjoyed there in the past and the service was frustratingly slow.

May 2, 2011|Wonderful experience... friendly|5|Wonderful experience... friendly waitresses (we went there twice). The food was fabulous. Try the calamari or clam chowder... you will not be disappointed they were the best I have had anywhere. I would recommend this restaurant to friends.

Waiter was very friendly and reasonably attentive given how busy it was. Very reasonable for the overall quality of the food, we were very impressed. This was our first visit and would definitely consider going again for a regular meal.
April 24, 2011|We had brunch on Easter and|3|"We had brunch on Easter and the food was good. I wouldn't classify it as ""outstanding"" but it was good. WE had reservations and we were seated right away and the service was very good. All in all, a good experience."
April 22, 2011|Since this restaurant is focused|2|Since this restaurant is focused on seafood I was surprised that nothing we ate except for the oysters seemed to be fresh. Everything is crusted and served with sauce. My mahi-mahi came with the same sauce you find at takeout Thai restaurants with spring rolls. Service was slow and oblivious.
April 22, 2011|Great service and good selection.|4|Great service and good selection. We love the Calamari here.
April 16, 2011|The dinner was good, but not|3|The dinner was good, but not outstanding. It was a typical nicer chain, in that there were many choices, and the staff aimed to please, but it was a chain. Since there are so many unique restaurants in the Providence area, I would try a smaller place that was not a chain. Chains are great when you don't know the area or if there is nothing else around, but there are so many options here and this was very expensive and just good. When I spend this much money, I want excellent! The reason we tried it was because we were given a gift certificate.
April 8, 2011|not worth the money|2|The menu selection was average, the food was executed poorly; did not meet our expectations.
April 3, 2011|Fine dining in the Biltmore.|5|Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was very quiet, accomodated our large party very easily. Service was outstanding, food was very good, and lunch was a great value.
April 2, 2011|Our friends and my wife and|4|Our friends and my wife and I celebrated my birthday at the restaurant. I especially enjoyed the Chilean sea bass. The $4.95 chopped salad is just OK. I would prefer a choice of a regular salad (but smaller) like the portion of the chopped salad. We will be back.
March 29, 2011|Dissapointed in Providence|2|I love seafood, and I was very dissapointed with the Providence location of McCormick & Schmidts. Our steamers appetizer had only 8 clams, and did not taste fresh at all. Our entrees were even less enjoyable. The lobster ravioli sounded good but there was no lobster to be found anywhere. They tasted like cheese raviolis, and the mediteranean topping of olives and sundried tomatoes was a strange accompanmient. We also had the sea scallops which were very small and tasted like they had been previously frozen. Our server never checked back after dropping the entrees...which was frusturating because several of us would have liked lemon with our fish. By the time she checked in, we were almost finished with our meal.
March 25, 2011|My girlfriend and I had our|5|My girlfriend and I had our 2-year anniversary coming up so I decided to look for a nice place to go for dinner in Providence. On the advice of a friend I chose McCormick & Schmick's. She was pleasantly surprised at how nice the back dining room is, including the booth seating (noting that the coat hooks are also a nice touch). Our server was very jovial and entertaining, doing a great job as a waiter while being quite friendly (commending us on a DVD we had bought). My girlfriend and I had the Atlantic Salmon and Catfish, respectively, and both were excellent and perfectly prepared. We finished our meal with the Mango Cheesecake, which was quite good. I will surely recommend this to friends looking for a place to spend a romantic night out

March 19, 2011|Second time the charm !|4|"This was my second time this month to eat at this restaurant. The service and food were excellent again and I was pleasantly surprised to find the noise level much better. Surprisingly we had the same waitress as last time. She explained that there were a lot of groups the last time who were attending the Providence College basketball game. So the secret must be if you want a romantic dinner don't go when there is a basketball game at the ""Dunk."""
March 14, 2011|Service was excellent. Waiter|5|Service was excellent. Waiter gave great recommendations and even offered alternatives for gluten free choices. Food was presented timely, not rushed, but still hot!
March 11, 2011|the overall experience was|3|the overall experience was very good. Great server, she was very friendly and knowledgable. However, the decor needs to be updated, the green on dark walls is a bit outdated and looked a bit dingy. The entrance also initially worried me. The hostess station should be better presented. Not a good look when you first walk in. I was happy to be pleasantly surprised when we were served dinner. EXCELLENT fish and chips, will go back.

March 5, 2011|Always enjoy the food at McCormick|4|Always enjoy the food at McCormick and Shmick's but if you are looking for a romantic dinner try somewhere else. The decor and the price of food should attract couples but instead attracts large groups of people enjoying themselves without concern for those that aren't part of their group.

February 12, 2011|Went the Saturday before Valentine'|4|Went the Saturday before Valentine's Day. The overall experience was good. The restaurant was very busy but was lovely. Our server, Conley was friendly and made good suggestions. However, we had just started on our appetizer when our salads arrived - a bit quick! She was also not aware of the special chocolate desert served for the evening. Also, while processing our credit card, it took a very long time for her to return. The food was good with a couple of off things. We had fried calamari which was soggy from the pepper rings though still tasty. My husband loved his mahi mahi! I had the lobster ravioli which would have been better with homemade pasta. Tasted like wonton skins. Excellent cocktails! Chocolate Mousse Cake was outstanding!
February 12, 2011|We wanted our friends to experience|4|We wanted our friends to experience your restaurant. Although the seafood is so fresh and the calarmari wonderful, we found the overall portions extremely small which would be fine if the prices reflected them. Additionally, my husband and I had the chillean seabass - way too salty.
February 12, 2011|We were there for an early|3|We were there for an early reservation. The beef was overcooked....soups were moderately warm but not throughout...calamari was good. I was very dissappointed for being a city restaurant in a reputable and prestigious hotel.
February 11, 2011|Highly Recommended|4|All in all, our evening at McCormick's was excellent. She ordered the fried calamari, I have a quad of oysters on the half shell. For our mains she had the crab cakes, I the Valentine's Day special of Filet and shrimp scampi. Everything was impeccably prepared and very tasty and well seasoned. Our only complaint would be portion sizes. They could have given a bit more on the calamari, and my filet was undersized and the 4 shrimp scampi were large shrimp, not jumbos. Shame on them for that, they could have given a touch more in the way of portion. Atmosphere was excellent. Nice view of the city of Providence. Our waitperson was attentive, personable, and very very nice to us.

The crab tower with lump crab meat, mango and avocado was sublime and the New Bedford Scallops with basil and tomato risotto was a stand out meal. We try to go to McCormick and Schmick's every time we're in Providence. It's always great.
February 6, 2011|Really bad Food|2|Many chains provide consistent good food like Cheescake Factory, Capital Grile PF Chang's, etc... Not McCormick & Schmick's. The fish is dry and tasteless, the sushi takes fake, the ginger tastes like plastic, the calamari is not crispy. Very bad experience.

February 5, 2011|For a large restaurant it|5|For a large restaurant it was amazingly quiet. The menu was quite varied, I enjoyed the old staple of fish and chips, the batter was very light and crispy. One person ordered the salmon but it wasn't cooked through and the staff immediately replaced the meal with very little wait time. I will definitely return to try more dishes. The service was quick and friendly. Very enjoyable overall.
February 5, 2011|Best spot in town for a fresh meal|5|This is my favorite place to eat. They have a wonderful fresh, daily menu. The Preferred Guest dining club is a fabulous deal. The wait staff is always friendly, professional and curteous. They also have a great children's menu and treat the kids as if they are always special.
February 4, 2011|Food was good, but nothing|4|Food was good, but nothing spectacular. Their steaks are priced like a fine steakhouse, but the quality of the preparation doesn't meet that of a fine steakhouse. The server was a little overbearing. We were seated, began chatting with menus still in hand, and he still came back to the table four times to see if he could take our order. I felt rushed. If the bill were about 60% of what it was, then maybe I would go back. Just wasn't worth the money.

January 22, 2011|It was a very busy evening|5|It was a very busy evening with a few events in town, and the restaurant was packed. The floor plan allowed for the large parties but also gave the two of us a quiet spot to enjoy our dinner. The food was great and fresh. The timing of the appetizer, wine, and entree were perfect and service was great. Prices were moderate but on the lower end for the quality of food you get. I'm never disappointed when I dine here.

I had to wait a while after I finished my meal for him to show up and be able to ask for my check. He was in a corner far away watching a game on TV. Not good service. The food was OK, not great either.

We made reservations for 8:30pm and on Saturday and stayed untill almost midnight. One of our favorite things, is just 'wineing and dining' all night. I was very excited to see the Wine Flights..number 1 the price was excellent, and 2, it was perfect for I love whites and my fiance loves Reds. Also we nibbled on the small plates on night long. The waitress was very encourageing for us to keep a menu and just keep ordering as fit. Never once did she try to rush us out, even as it got closer to closing. We had the perfect night and would recommend the restaurant to anyone.

What would have made it a perfect ten experience was if we were not sat at the worst table in the house, right in front of the kitchen. There were open tables throughout the restaurant so I was dissapointed they sat us there, I made my reservation well in advance hoping for a good seat :( I would go back just requesting a specific table next time.
December 24, 2010|Very nice decor and atmosphere.|2|"Very nice decor and atmosphere. Yes, oyster sample was good but very pricey. The menu advertised fresh seafood that could be grilled--not true. I asked for my my fish to be grilled but the server informed me that all of the fish had already been breaded. All of the fish except the salmon was prepared with some sort of butter sauce or cooked in butter. Not what I had pictured for a ""fresh"" seafood restaurant. Overall, it is an overpriced chain restaurant. Next time I will make sure to find a local spot where I can get real local food."

December 11, 2010|This was a visit for my youngest|4|This was a visit for my youngest daughter's 21st b-day. Our waiter was utterly wonderful and made our visit all that more special. Food was excellent, though prices in this economy might take a nudge a little bit - a pretty big ticket for a single mom with two daughters. Dessert was to die for! 3 chocolate thingy. Everyone treated us wonderfully - I enjoy McCormick's for right after work, brunch, or lunch, but only special occasions for dinner. New $5 minimum valet for under 3 hours at the restaurant? Again - economy.....as free parking was a lure for people to go it might now become a deterrence.

It was our first time at this restaurant and the setting was perfect--think traditional, downtown restaurant: comfortable, friendly, efficient, and very attentive staff. The bar area was quite inviting. The food was good, though the gravy was over-salted. Plan to go again and sample the seafood, their speciality."

They accomodated some relatively minor adjustments to some of the dishes and everything was great. We were going to a show and the waiter understood that and kept us moving right along so that we wouldn't be late (or rushing).

We will definately go again, and when we have family and friends in town this will be one of our dining spots.

November 7, 2010|The items on the special menu|4|The items on the special menu all sounded as if they were fit for a king. I narrowed my choices to two. My wife reminded me that I should pick one over the other for health reasons. The young lady that served us made recommendations that made the meal even better than I had expected. The food was great, the service excellent and the surrounding made for a very pleasant dinner.
October 30, 2010|Made reservations and glad|4|Made reservations and glad I did. The place does fill up fast. Good service and a nice place to take the significant other. The only problem that I had was the toughness of the steak and the shrimp. I ordered the 6 oz Filet Mignon with Stuffed Shrimp, both were a little tough as though they had cooked the meats way too fast on too high of a temperature. But as I said before, the place was pretty busy. Other then that, awesome place to go relax and have a good meal with a group or a date.
October 30, 2010|Our experience was wonderful!|5|Our experience was wonderful! The choices were top notch as well as the food. Our server, John, was very impressive also. He knew about all of the food we questioned and how they cooked it, as well as the taste. He offered suggestions in all price ranges as well as a wine to compliment the meal. We sat in a quiet room behind the bar, which offered privacy for quiet talk. We frequent this restaurant for special occasions and will continue to go back in the future. I highly recommend it!

August 28, 2010|The dining experience overall|4|"The dining experience overall was very good. Very nice atmosphere and our waiter was very attentive. I gave the food only 3 stars for two reasons: 1) My steak was overcooked, I ordered medium, which to me should be a warm pink center, and it came out medium well with a gray center, 2) the ""garden"" salad consisted of some shredded lettuce (some of which was turning brown)in some sort of hard tortilla shell and a couple of grape tomatoes - I am a salad lover and was a bit disappointed in this one. The appetizer of littlenecks on the half shell were excellent - very fresh. The veggies that came with the steak were excellent as well, and we shared some risotto that was quite good. My daughters meat was cooked perfectly and she was happy."

The service was average (not attentive; plates left at the table long after we finished; when asked about three dishes, the waitress said, ""Well, I don't like those personally, but I hear they're good""). The food was overpriced for what you got. The Grilled Lobster and Shellfish Brochette was very good, (especially the couscous!), but the menu said lobster tail, when it was only half a lobster tail. At the bar, men were singing along to the '80s songs. I asked about karaoke, but the waitress said they don't have karaoke, just a rowdy group that spilled over from another room. Odd evening overall and no need to go back. For a $180 bill for two, a C+ at best."

July 9, 2010|"We are ""foodies"" I guess."|3|"We are ""foodies"" I guess. I love oysters, M&S is best in our area, so I ordered 12, then another 4 of my favorites. The waiter had an annoying habit, as I am seeming to remember other waiters have of continual ""upsell"", refilling wine glasses, (and in the past, sparkling water glasses) in order to wrench as much revenue out of our seating as possible. After ordering three appetizers I didn't order a main, but agreed to share my husband's, the waiter tried (unsuccessfully) to remove my side dish and all my silverware, as if to say ""well you are all done- in my book!"" It marred the experience for me. I am pretty certain it is company policy. If I noticed, probably others do. Why not respect your wonderful food more than money, please."
July 9, 2010|Upon entering restaurant at|3|Upon entering restaurant at reservation time, no greeter/hostess for about 10 minutes. We had to find the greeter/hostess. Web site said dinner menu started at 3PM but hostess said at our 4 PM reservation that the dinner menu had not been printed yet. It really did not seem like the hostess was expecting any guests. About 4:20 we were seated and told we could now order from the dinner menu. Food portions were small for the price of both orders-Clams with linguine (5 clams)at approx $18.00 and fish and chips (small pieces of fish in lots of batter) for approx $17.00. This restaurant will not be on our go back to list. There was an odor to the restaurant that was unpleasant. This was our first visit and a gift from our granddaughter
July 2, 2010|I always like going to this|5|I always like going to this McCormick & Schmick. Since it is n the grand old Biltmore Hotel, it has a nice location where you can sit at the window and people watch the downtown pedestrian traffic. (a lot more interesting than overlooking a parking lot as most suburban restaurants do). Food & service outstanding as usual! I like this one as the McCormick & Schmick's near me in New Jersey has terrible ambiance. They stuck it in the Bridgewater Mall, and actually offer a kid's special menu. BOTH times we had been to that one, I felt like we were dining at Friendly's during a birthday party - or at best, a Red Lobster... ARGH! That's why the one in Providence is such a treat by comparison.

We were seated in the middle of the room and the table next to us were very loud where we could not hear our conversation unless we shouted. The food was not overly special for the relatively high price. Sorry.

Food was good - but nothing special; Service was only average - the waiter could not multi-task at all - oen request and he was gone for awhile....I asked for a special table via the Open Table - and they barely recognized my reservation - even after they called to verify I was coming. Will not go back, and I plan to be in Providence many more times - so many other choices available. Do some homework.
May 21, 2010|We often go to McC & S before|5|We often go to McC & S before theater at Trinity. I squelch my customary aversion to national chain restaurants because it has the feel of a local restaurant. The fish is always great and the wine list large enough and fairly priced. Odd for me to notice, but the vegetables were cooked to perfection! On Fridays, we always ask for Amanda as our waitperson.
May 15, 2010|We have been to McCormick|5|We have been to McCormick & Schmick before and have always had excellent meals but this was sensational!

May 8, 2010|We were never asked by our|3|"We were never asked by our waitress how the food was or we would have told her, and it wasn’t real busy. For appetizers we had stuffed clams and a mussel’s dish. The clams were really awesome but I had at least 3 “bad” mussels that I had to spit out of my mouth and other that didn’t look too good. For dinner we both had a stuffed swordfish dish that came highly recommended from our server. Although the dish was flavorful, for $24 we should have gotten a more ""meaningful"" piece of fish. We both felt like we received two end pieces that were left over from a “real” swordfish dinner. And $13 for a Johnny Walker Black, you’ve got to be kidding. From now on we’ll stick with M&S in Boston, “Gracie’s” in Providence and “Spain” in Cranston."

Nice variety on menu, apps were good but entree very average & surprisingly overcooked for seafood. Service was an absolute joke. Server unskilled/unprofessional & scattered. waited 14 minutes to greet us, Stood at next empty booth griping to co-worker who had to tell her to ""SHHHHH"" while we're waiting - as our food gets colder, for her to bring us the forgotten crab tools and knives.. Food & drink delivered piece meal. Not returning!"

We had the RI stuffies and they were good, not great, but good. I had the filet and crab entre and it was great. The filet was so tender i almost didnt need a knife and the crab was cooked to perfection. I added a second side of crab for $5, the one that comes with the dinner ( 4 oz.) would not be enough. My wife ordered the scallops, but they had run out at 8 PM on a Saturday night? She asked if they would make baked stuffed shrimp, not on the menu except as a side to something, and they did. They were good, but the stuffing was a little dry. We added some garlic fries and they were awesome!

I had the special, stuffed salmon, and it was awesome. Was stuffed with crab meat, cracker crumbs and brie. I was creamy and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The mashed potato was a bit stiff, obviously made in large batches and they had begun to get starchy. My mom had the fish and chips and it was 3 pcs. of white fish cooked perfectly with a large helping of fries. Everything was fantastic.
March 20, 2010|The restaurant was uncomfortably|1|The restaurant was uncomfortably hot. The filet of beef had no flavor and was very small. The crab that was supposed to accompany the filet for $26 was no more than a mushy dollop mixed in with a flavorless sauce. We weren't served rolls, and unlike the online menu that we read before reserving our table, the menu listed charges for basics like a dinner salad, potato, and vegetable. We will not be returning when we know we can always get a satisfying, delicious meal right around the corner at the Cheesecake Factory.

We waited at the door for about ten minutes, where nobody was there to greet us. We had to walk around the bar to the tables in the dining area to find assistance to get a table. Our waitress was not very attentive to us. We asked for straws for our water and she never got them for us. We had to go to the bar and get them ourselves. We needed a soup spoon for the stew and we had to wait until the soup was cool to finally find another waiter to get one for us.

There were no seats at the bar so we had to stand with our drinks and were in the path of the staff. The specialty drinks menu has no prices, so beware; a Mariner's Mojito and a Hendrick's Gin martini was $24.00 before the tip. Our waiter was knowledable about the menu and recommended the fried calamari, but we ordered raw oysters. A server came with both and we didn't realize they were intended for us because we hadn't ordered the calamari. Our waiter came with the oysters and said the order of calamari was his mistake. Thinking that the calamari was free due to his error, we accepted them and were surprised to be charged for the calamari. Should've asked.

Got the Crab, shrimp and artichoke dip was out of this world and the portion was huge. Entrees came out quick too, lobster ravioli was drowned in sauce but good if sauce was brushed aside. Ahi Tuna was presented nicely and of outstanding quality. Dessert, took a bit but was worth the wait. The flourless chocolate cake and the vanilla bean creme brule were AMAZING. Manager Mark Phillips made two excellent dessert wine pairing suggestions which helped to finish the meal with perfection. I highly recommend.
December 31, 2009|We have continually enjoyed|5|"We have continually enjoyed our experiences here. We try different entree's each time and they're always great. On several visits including tonight, we took advantage of the specials. Tonight was the New Years eve special and I chose a 6oz filet with bake stuffed shrimp. Typically, I have seen a menu mention an item such as ""with a Baked Stuffed Shrimp"" and it meant one. To my surprise, I received 3 fantastic Baked Stuffed Shrimp with an incredible stuffing that was WOW! I (We) shall return!"

Our waiter was wonderful, very helpful in making suggestions, very personable and although he was interested in how we were doing and if our food was to our liking, he was not a pest about it and did not bother us. The menu was awesome and the wine list outstanding. It was a wonderful experience all around and we truly enjoyed ourselves. We will definately go again.

My husband enjoyed his eggs, my son ordered eggs benedict which he said was ""not was good as mom-mom's"". I ordered scrambled eggs which were cold and dry. I would not eat breakfast here on our next trip into Providence."
November 21, 2009|The restaurant was comfortable|4|The restaurant was comfortable and quiet, even at 7:00 Saturday night. It was warmly lit with a candlelight feel. Our waiter was very nice and quite knowledgeable of both the menu and wine list. Our food and drinks were served promptly, but not rushed. The seafood fettuccine was excellent and my wife raved about the her crab cake. It was a shame that neither of us had room for desert. Over all it was exactly the experience we were looking for, a quiet romantic dinner.

November 8, 2009|The Veteran's menu provided|5|The Veteran's menu provided more entree choices than I was expecting - finally chose the crusted tilapia w/Jamaican salsa (my wife chose cedar plank salmon w/berry sauce from the regular menu). Both meals were cooked perfectly with gourmet style presentation (was the Food Network filming incognito at the Providence, RI location? I almost expected to see Bobby Flay come out of the kitchen and announce one of his famous throwdowns - LOL). Overall, a great meal and relaxing evening.

November 7, 2009|As usual, a great dinner.|4|As usual, a great dinner. We both had the petite filet and stuffed shrimp. The steak is always cooked as requested and tastes great. The only thing I don't like about this place is its a chain. It's the only chain that I know of that doesn't have the characteristics of a chain restaurant.
October 26, 2009|Again we enjoyed celebrating|5|Again we enjoyed celebrating a birthday here. The menu had a special greeting just for us. Staff made an effort to greet us and make sure everything was to our liking. We enjoyed fantastic seafood and sides as well as a yummy dessert based on local ingredients. We will definitely return for more celebrations.

October 24, 2009|Good. Overall the food is|3|Good. Overall the food is very good and the waitstaff is adequate. When I say adequate they seemed to be well trained however don't have the depth to service customers when they get marginally busy. As an example, our wait person was great until his tables were expanded and things got Saturday night busy. Then my wife and I are were forgotten. Left to twist in the wind as bus boys hovered over us waiting for us to leave. As examples: The promise of a second cup of coffee resulted in us having to flag down a passing waiter. Or the bus boy whisked away our half eaten deserts without asking if we were done or they could be wrapped up for us. Oh well... I think we will try somewhere else the next time we go to the theater.

It is promoted as a means ot enjoy the seafood selection .Aside from that the meal and food were very good. The server/waitress was not very attentive to our needs- did not offer us bread - we had to request it etc.

THE RESTAURANT WAS VERY ELEGANT AND QUIET, THE DINNER MENU WAS WONDERFUL AND THE WINE LIST EVEN BETTER. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE WAS OUR SERVER DID NOT ATTEND OUR DRINKING NEEDS IN PAIRING A NICE WINE FOR OUR DISHES. MY WIFE HAD THE MAKO SHARK AND SAID IT WAS PERFECT, I HAD THE LOBSTER TAIL, GRILLED SHRIMP AND CRAB CAKES WHICH WAS GREAT EXCEPT THE LOBSTER WAS COLD. OVERALL, WE WOULD GO AGAIN.

October 10, 2009|My whole experience there|2|My whole experience there seemed rushed . Like we had to get out so you could get more people in. I had reservations for 7:00 pm and done by 7:30. We asked for water 3 times and NEVER received any , everyone around us wes enjoying some warm rolls and bread .Which we NEVER received OR was offered. We ordered our meals which were delicious BUT . I ordered 2 halibut dinners just for me each piece of fish(2) was thin and about 1/2 the size of my cell phone and didnt get twice the vegetables. Now we also ordered mashed potatoes..they were were forgotten all about. Finally i saw the waiter again frustrated AND eating the last bean on my I had to ask for them which he had clearly forgot about. We decided to have desert waited 15 mins for the tray

It made a huge difference in our dining experience because of that. Food, as always, was delicious.
October 1, 2009|We were seated slightly too|3|We were seated slightly too close to the bar for our taste so got a lot of spill-over noise. Appetizers and drinks came efficiently. Clam chowder was very good. Had pan-fried oysters whose presentation was underwhelming (sitting on shredded lettuce), but tasted good. Never offered any bread, don't know if they had any. There was a longer than we liked wait until the main course came. I had a grilled shrimp and crabcake combo with vegetables. Fresh, but not too special (just in a light butter sauce). Husband had tilapia that he enjoyed. Portions were very reasonable. We were eating out before the theater and didn't have enough time to have dessert. Overall, pleasant but we've had better for the price.
September 26, 2009|The server we has was amazing.|5|The server we has was amazing. It is very hard to find someone who knows the menu like that now days. He was answered any questions we had and made sure our orders were correct, with having certain items on the side. We were able to get in and get seated right away. We never had to wait for anything and when every we needed refills or try something else our server was there.

The service, food, and appearance was excellent. Valet parking was only five dollars for three hours which gave us enough time to dine and view Waterfire.

We ordered or appetizers, a bowl of lobster bisque and the Ahi tuna, and both were excellent. A large oyster sampler followed and was fresh and cold. After that, it went down hill. Our main courses took a while to show up and both were luke warm. I had the steak and shrimp combo and my wife had the coconut crusted mahi mahi. The taste was there, but the food was not hot. The mashed potato with the steak and shrimp was hard and starchy, like they were from yesterday and had been reheated. Coffee took forever to come and the check as well. A good 30 mins of time waiting, and never offered a second cup of coffee!
September 19, 2009|We went to your restaurant|5|We went to your restaurant to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and had a lovely evening. We made reservations for 6pm and requested a table. we were seated immediatly upon our arrival at a table like we requested, our server was prompt Rhonda was her name and she was very attentive to us. We love coming to McCormick and Schmicks!
August 29, 2009|It's easy to say that a 4|5|It's easy to say that a 4 or 5 star restaurant provided a fantastic dining experience and a wonderful romantic opportunity for a couple to get reacquainted. It is, after all how a place like McCormick & Schmick's earns its reputation. However, like all extraordinary dining establishments, it needs to be experienced to be truly appreciated. Limited by the amount space available to review McCormick & Schmick's, I will simply say that every single facet of the McCormick & Schmick's dining experience is far and away the finest in Providence (a city world renown for its dining). You are doing yourself a disservice if you travel to the city and don't dine there and if you are a Rhode Islander? Make McCormick & Schmick's a must visit!

August 22, 2009|After a positive first impression|2|"After a positive first impression of the ""space"" we were seated and asked for the wine list, as we always do. What a shock! All the prices were at least 4 to 5 times retail, sometimes more. This is totally unacceptable and shows little regard for the patron's sense of value, particularly in these difficult times. One should be able to enjoy a meal and a bottle of wine without feeling ripped off. My wife ordered a half dozen clams and was served five, I guess the kitchen thought we couldn't count. When alerted the waiter did remove it from our bill. Her lobster mac n cheese was greasy and lacked flavor but my stripped bass was well cooked and tasted fresh. Service was attentive if a bit slow, but then it was Saturday night."

August 8, 2009|Excellent which is why we|5|Excellent which is why we went there after our Chicago and Minneapolis experience - you need an N/A for some of these ratings as - thisrestaurant is NOT designed for outdoors - but the one in Boston is - I am not into Wine - and it was too early to judge the bar scene - it would probably be kid friendly any time by a Saturday night - and ground floors do not allow for scenic views

Our server was very nice, attentive but over bearing. My entree was so exceptional I have forgotten what else we had. The Sea Bass was perfectly cooked and served on stir fried vegetables and noodles with an elegant sauce. One of the best ever. My guest also enjoyed her entree. The creme brulee for desert was decadent and delicious. Total before tip, without wine, was $115 making it more expensive than indicated by the Open Table rating system.

July 25, 2009|Nine of us went to dinner|3|Nine of us went to dinner last night in RI. Though it was a busy night due to Waterfire and Restaurant Week, it was really not an excuse for the almost 4 hours it took for us to complete dinner. Our server was very nice, but took much too much time between courses. We ordered nothing unusual, the kids ordered sandwiches or pasta. Having arrived at 6:30, so we could be out by 8:30 for the start of Waterfire, we were still not served entrees at 8:30. By the time we paid the bill it was after 10:00 and the kids were too tired to see the event.

July 8, 2009|Overall a disappointment.|2|Overall a disappointment. I realize that its a chain restaurant but the food was average at best. Appetizers were very good but entrees were mediocre, so much so that we sent one back and ended up ordering something different altogether. Definitely not worth the money, would not return and will never visit another of their locations.
July 6, 2009|This place looks nice, but|2|This place looks nice, but it's all for show. My wife and I arrived at 7:02 p.m. for dinner expecting a leisurely dining experience with a few drinks to kill the 2.5 hours we had before going to a movie. We requested a nice table and were obliged nicely by the m.d. In a flurry of activity we were served drinks, bread, appetizer, and main entre within a space of 12 minutes - faster than MacDonalds sometimes. It was no wonder, though, since the coconut crusted Mahi Mahi we both ordered tasted like a Mrs. Paul fish stick and was probably cooked in a toaster. Mine was not edible. If you are coming to Providence from out of state, please avoid this place. We have so many good restaurants that you certainly don't need to waste your time.

Perhaps b/c it was a last-minute booking during graduation weekend, we didn't get a good table -- right in the middle of the room. A booth would have been much better. We had to yell to communicate over the noise. The food was a disappointment. My salmon was completely overcooked. It was so hot, I couldn't even put it in my mouth when it came out of the kitchen. The lobster & artichoke risotto was okay, but only had about 3 pieces of lobster in it. I would have sent it back, but we were celebrating our anniversary with my parents and I didn't want to ruin the mood. We won't be going back to this overpriced tourist trap.

May 16, 2009|My husband and i dined there|2|"My husband and i dined there with another couple. We all ordered different entrees and we all were quite satisfied with the food. The service though, was another story. In one word, ""horrendous"". It took our waitress 25 minutes to take our order. When our meals came, we still had our (half eaten) salads in front of us, because it was only 5 minutes later! She didn't remove our salads since we were still eating so we ate dinner on a very crowded table. Then, when she offered us the dessert tray, two of us still had our dinner dishes in front of us! The final straw was her telling us that she'd be there since 9 a.m. and were we ready to close out our tab! With all the wonderful choices of places to dine,we will NOT be returning!"
May 15, 2009|The service was excellent.|4|The service was excellent. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. The only disappointment was the dessert. The usually excellent chocolate bag with white chocolate mousse was changed to a filling of thick chocolate mousse, we think. The previous filling was much lighter and much tastier.

May 1, 2009|We have dined here many times|3|"We have dined here many times but each time has been slightly less enjoyable then the previous time. The food is always good but the service levels are diminishing. My wife ordered a mixed grill and simply asked to substitute out one type of fish for another (a less expensive filet to boot) and were told ""no, they are already portioned out"". This was disappointing seeing we visit this location 4-5 times a year. In the past the chef has created custom dishes on our request. Hopefully this was just our server not being as attentive as the others and not indicative of the restauarant's direction in servicing their diners."

April 24, 2009|The food and service were|1|"The food and service were fine. However, we have never had a dining experience like this. We were seated for lunch at a table by the windows at street level. Despite the presence of both curtains and shades neither were in use as apparently the restaurant believed their diners would enjoy looking out at the seemingly endless parade of local characters, some who enjoyed spitting on the sidewalk as they passed by. While trying to enjoy our lunch against this ""interesting"" backdrop, a brawl between two youths broke out with blood and yes more spit flying. Apparently, this was not an unusual mid-day event since people and traffic continued to pass by. Unless you're looking for a dining experience along Skid Row, skip the window tables!"

We then waited for 20 minutes for someone (not our server) to get pre-dinner drink orders, and then another 10 mins for them to arrive. After ordering our food, things went smoothly. Downside was that the red wines were served at room temp. Overall, a bit disapointing, considering it was a special birthday celebration.

The pricing was very reasonable for being in the center of Providence and valet service at the Biltmore Hotel for $2. for 3 hours while dining, left no hassle for us to park the car. We're planning on going again in the near future. You won't be disappointed if you enjoy seafood.

March 6, 2009|The staff at McCormick and|5|"The staff at McCormick and Schmick's always seem to go out of their way to do something to make every visit special. We visited for a ""birthday"" celebration, and from the menu with a specialized Birthday greeting to the complimentary birthday cake served for dessert, this was no exception. The food is always top notch, but because they only serve fresh seafood, the menu selection can vary greatly depending on the time of year. Look into their Preferred Guest program, it is well worth it!"
February 21, 2009|The table we were seated at|4|"The table we were seated at was small and in the path of the servers. I asked when we were taken to the table if we could sit somewhere else and they responded with ""each reservation is linked to a specific table"". The food was DELICIOUS! The chef was accommodating, the service was okay - they needed to be asked several times to refill our water glasses - but the restaurant was too noisy and the table was way too small for 4 people and in the pathway. $2 valet parking was a real plus however--we will go back to McCormick & Schmick's, but not in Providence. We'll stick with the 2 Boston locations."

The whole experience was incredible. You should have more special occasions with prix-fix meals to highlight the restaurant.
February 14, 2009|Overall it was nice. Reservations|3|Overall it was nice. Reservations were perfect and we were seated immediately. The waitstaff was courteous, but obviously very busy and it was tough to get a hold of someone to check on our drinks. There were long lulls between ordering and recieiving... the wait for the salads and drinks must have been 20 minutes and we were done with them it was about 20 more minutes before the entrees came out. The food overall was very good. The mahi mahi lacked a little of the zazz I was expecting. Some salt did the trick. My boyfriend's stuffed salmon was fantastic. Overall, good, but a little overpriced.
February 14, 2009|We went for the valentine|3|We went for the valentine special. Lobster tail was good and Steak was overdone. Small portion but good for the price $29.99 For 3 course. Waiter was very nice but service was slow. Drinks were great.. Will go back if in the area, but wouldnt go out of my way to get there.
February 14, 2009|Overall dining experience|3|Overall dining experience was excellent. Our waitress did forget to check up on drinks often, but we understand it was Valentine's Day and crowded.

The service was poor but our expectations may have been dampened as it was Valentines Day. The waitress seemed preturbed or under pressure as we decided on a wine. She finally gave us the extra bread requested but not until our salads were removed and after a second request was made and our main courses arrived right after, our deserts all arrived without the requested coffee, two of us were almost done when the coffee was first brought(read more above). All in all, not what we expected.

My wife and I had a Valentines Day special of steak and hlf baked lobster along with dessert. I was a really good deal and as I said we'll definately go back soon. I recommending joining their club on line. You pay $25 dollars to join and you get a $25 certificate in the mail which we used. You can accumulate points for additional discounts and you also get a certificate, I believe, for a dinner entree on your birthday.

Prices are a little high but overall the experience was very positive and suitable for my special occassion- a nice dinner before attending a performance at the PPAC. Thumbs up!

The food was fantastic, the service top notch. The Manager came over to our table making sure everything was OK. We are always treated with the utmost consideration. We dine with our 6 year old & she loves this place! They have a great kids menu. WE highly recommend eating here!
February 8, 2009|Dined with a friend. The food|4|Dined with a friend. The food was excellent and,surprisingly, the prices were very reasonable for a top-tier restaurant. While the bar and restaurant were quite busy, conversation was possible despite a moderate noise level. Parking a bit inconvenient if going elsewhere after dining and one doesn't want to move the car again.
February 7, 2009|The food was great! Menu changes|3|The food was great! Menu changes daily based on what is fresh. I've been to the same chain in other cities as well and the only real difference I saw was the waitstaff. It was pathetic here. I've had better staff at Denny's. Our table for four ran a nearly 300 dollar bill, and the waitress, when she actually remembered us, could not consistantly count to four to provide water, cutlery, and chopsticks (for the Ahi)or drinks for the table. After living in Manhattan Beach, Ca and highly recomending this place to clients and frinds, I was quite frankly embarrassed by the service here in Providence. Again though, even here in New England, the seafood was top-notch, steak was great and the drinks were creative and tasty.

The hostess was so gracious to call to confirm and ask if it was a special occassion. When I told her it was my parent's 55th wedding anniversary, she offered to print up the menu with a special message on it. They loved the special touch! Thanks again.

January 6, 2009|We went during luncheon hours|4|We went during luncheon hours but the restaurant accomodated us by letting us order from the previous nights dinner menu. They also made us an appetizer that we wanted even though it was not on the menu. The stuffed salmon was absolutely delicious. The host, waiter and chef were helpful and knowledgeable. We would definately go again.
January 3, 2009|I was not really impressed|3|I was not really impressed with the food. Small portions and my of my meal was cold. My friend's meal was very small (two scallops in her main course for $26.00!). The service was very good as we had a wonderful server and the dining room was beautiful. I would probably not return.
January 3, 2009|We have been here many times|3|We have been here many times before. Its a good downtown meeting place with a large selection of seafood. This time however, the food was only average and the service was below average (almost inattentive). Although we had 2 hours to eat before getting to the theatre, we didn't even have time for coffee.

Not to mention that we had the breakfast there that was part of our hotel package at the Biltmore and it was great. All of the staff were more than friendly and accommodating. For New Year's Eve, the resturant was on top of thier game. They didn't try to rush us out of table which happened to be a very comfortable booth. I would Definately go back!!

As M&S is known for fresh seafood (although they do a nice job on steak, etc as well), we all had our favorite seafood dishes: salmon on cedar plank (2), stuffed salmon and mahi-mahi. Dessert tray -- wanted to try them all but what we chose were great! Attentive and unobtrusive service throughout the meal. Thanks!
December 25, 2008|Christmas lunch at M&S was|3|Christmas lunch at M&S was quite good. Service was excellent and sensitive to needs of my mother who is in a wheel chair. A bit noisy, but obviously enjoyed by many groups of family members grateful that it is open on major holidays.
December 20, 2008|Great new presentation on|4|"Great new presentation on the scallops with artichokes and bacon - always one of our favorites. Also Tilapia with salsa was good. Rhode Island calamari lacked their usual crispness - batter falling off the calamari. Great Chocolate ""bag"" with mousse and fresh fruits for dessert - that was a highlight!"
December 14, 2008|I can't say enough about this|5|I can't say enough about this restaurant. We always receive wonderful service and the food is delicious. The manager always comes over & treats us like royalty! The menu is printed up daily with fresh and diverse seafood selections. We took our friends & their 2 children here recently and they loved it. The kids menu is splendid, and they are most definately a kid friendly place. They always seat us appropriatley so other diners aren't disturbed by the children. Highly recommended!
December 13, 2008|Although this is a large chain|4|Although this is a large chain of restaurants they seem to have their act together. Quantities were good, price excellent, waitstaff very knowledgable, and the valet parking for less than $5 was a pleasant surprise.
December 10, 2008|Inexpensive valet service|3|Inexpensive valet service at the door was a great start. We were seated promptly, An appetizer of oysters sampler was served perfectly chilled on a bed of ice with lemon wedges and two cocktail sauces. The oysters sampler consisted of four types from Rhode Island, one from PEI and one from Deleware. The dinners, however, did not live up to our great expectations of McCormick and Schmicks. The Sesame Ahi Tuna was mediocre at best. The small portion was presented over a bed of stir fried vegetables with little flavor on either side of a pasty lump of jasmine rice. The swordfish was a small, dry, half inch thick piece served with roasted potatoes and broccoli and topped with a sun dried tomato butter. Probably won't be back again.
Dined on December 5, 2008|At this Providence Restaurant|5|At this Providence Restaurant they serve up exceptional food. The price was good for this quality venue, but yes it is worth it. The food is absolutely on the money, and so is the service. Our waiter Chris was very attendant to our requests, and took us throughout the extensive dining and wine menus. This is absolutely a 5+ star dining experience. Great job to the owners and the management.
November 27, 2008|Overall a satisfying Thanksgiving|4|Overall a satisfying Thanksgiving Day experience. Traditional turkey dinner, quite good and reasonably priced, though enough for two. Service very good, even at 5PM, a time when some restaurants seem overwhelmed on holidays. A little noisy, but tables comfortably spaced. Will definitely go back.
November 27, 2008|My family had a wonderful|4|My family had a wonderful non-traditional meal for Thanksgiving. The stuffed sole was prepared with fresh shrimp and crab meat and presented in a casserole so as to keep the lemon butter sauce separate from the rice and vegetable. Our server was most accommodating. allowing my mother to substitute mashed potatoes for the rice. Although the restaurant was packed, our meals arrived in a timely fashion and we never felt rushed to finish our dinner to make room for the next party.

We had joked how we were starving and she immediately brought over bread and our wine. We were not rushed at all. When ordering our waitress answered our questions and gave my wife an alternate suggestion that she went with. My wife was pleased with the recommendation. My with had a combo with chicken and baked stuff shrimp. My wife (who herself is quite a cook)thought this was the best baked stuffed shrimp she ever had. I too had the combo but with sirloin and shrimp scampi, Wonderful! We had a small issue with the bill but that was immediately resolved to every-one's.satisfaction.
November 1, 2008|The Providece McCormick &|4|The Providece McCormick & Shmick's was typical of this upscale chain. The place was busy, the food was very good, the waitstaff was amiable, the service was quick and everyone was very friendly. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our waiter introduced himself immediately after we were seated, he made some great suggestions and a very enjoyable meal followed. My date ordered seafood mixed grill and I ordered the stuffed swordfish. I also ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer and we both ordered a salad. The tuna was a small portion, but it was well presented and very tasty. The salads were large and very fresh. The entrees were also good sizes, well presented with great starch and vegetables. I always consider M&S when travelling.

On this particular occasion, they were out of the dessert I ordered so they brought out another dessert free of charge as their way of saying sorry. It's the little things like that that make McCormick's worth a visit! I definately recommend and I will definately be back!
October 19, 2008|We were disappointed. It took|2|We were disappointed. It took awhile to getv our drinks. We ordered appetizers, chowder and main meal. We finally received our drink, took one sip and the chowder shows up and 2 minutes later our appetizer shows up. By the time we ate our chowder the appetizer was cold and rubbery(calamari). As soon as the waiter took the plates away our meal was on the table. Not very relaxing at all. The fish and chips were served in this big wire bowl with waxed paper - the fish on top of the fries - not a good presentation for 18.95 Lastly, we waited 35 minutes to pay our check because they had computer issues. I became a preferred member but I do not think I will go back again.
October 17, 2008|Overall it was o.k. For a|2|Overall it was o.k. For a seafood place the filet mignon was the best along with the calamari but for the rest of the meanl (seaford wild medley), the salmon was dry and the chilean sea bass was extremely oily and an end cut. I was disappointed as I understand that its a chain but thought it was at a different calaber than the 99 restaurant in quality and the price would have suggested so.
October 11, 2008|The food was good but not|3|The food was good but not great. Unfortunately there were little kids running around and yelling (at 8pm!) which was annoying, since we had come to be alone...and had asked for a quiet table as my husband wears hearing aids. Before you think we are old fogeys, we have 5 children of our own so we know better than to bring them out for a late dinner! We did get a nice booth with curtains, so they did try. Our waitress was wonderful. My husband thought his food was terrific; mine was average but I am a chef and I am very picky.

September 13, 2008|Everything was perfect at|5|Everything was perfect at McCormick & Schmick's Providence. We had the blackened catfish and the filet mignon/stuffed shrimp combo. Steak cooked to perfection and the catfish had plenty flavor. The service couldn't have been better. We were celetrating my birthday.
September 13, 2008|This was our first time dining|3|This was our first time dining at McCormick and Schmick's. My husband and I took my Grandmother as she loves seafood. My husbands meal was great, and so was mine. However, my grandmother got the Salmon on a wood plank and it was almost raw in the center. Now I must add that she didn't want to say anything to the waiter. I encouraged her to send it back as I'm sure they would have been happy to fix it, but she is almost 90 and didn't want to cause a stink. So it is difficult to rate the food as two of the meals were excellent and one of the meals was terrible.
September 13, 2008|First time at this location|2|First time at this location and this was the worst experience. Service was unattentative - took a long time to bring out the food - forgot the bread; ice had melted under the raw oysters by the time we got it; and forgot the sides that came with the main dish. Not sure if the restaurant was trying to cut cost or something, but at other M.S. locations, the fried oyster appetizer is 8 pieces instead of 4 at this place. The mixed steamers were bland both in taste and in presentation. Overall a bad experience especially I have been a fan of the restaurant in the Boston and NJ locations.
September 12, 2008|One of the most favorable|5|One of the most favorable dining experiences I've had. The atmosphere is very comfortable and welcoming. All the staff members are very friendly and knowledgable. The wait times for the food was exceptional. The top sirloin steak, coconut shrimp, and mashed potatoe dish was outstanding. My guest also recommends the filet mignon. For the service and quality of food and atmosphere, pricing was absolutely reasonable. I was delighted at the fact that when I made reservationas online, everything went as planned and was very well organized. The valet parking also made it easier for my guest and I to enjoy our visit. I will deffinitely return for future dining!

August 30, 2008|Dining at McCormack and Schmidts|4|Dining at McCormack and Schmidts was a delightful experience from beginning to end. The Maitre D was quite professional, seated me immediately as she promised to look out for my son who strolled in a few minutes late. The wait staff Lanna was truly delightful-- personable, attentive, informed, and upbeat. (If I lived in Providence I would go back every night and insist on sitting at whatever table she was assigned.) And at the dinner's end, the floor manager was quite willing to personally handle validating our parking stub even though we remembered at the very last second. As a road warrior (100 days on the road each year) this is the level of attentiveness I find all too rarely in any but the best of establsihments. Count me a fan.

I got a mussell appetizer which was delicious and my husband got clam chowder that tasted funny. My husband got the 2 lb. lobster and he enjoyed it. I got the Mixed Grille and it was so small, it looked either like an appetizer or a sampler plate. There were two pieces of fish on the plate and each were about the size of a sea scallop. I am a very petite woman with a small appetite and I left the restaurant very hungry. I was extremely disappointed. I do not mind paying good money for a meal, but at least give me enough food to satisfy me. The meal did not even present well on the plate. I will never go back and would not recommend this. No value, so-so food. Great waiter.

July 12, 2008|I have been before , but only|3|I have been before , but only for appetizers//oysters etc.. I love the service ,the ambience so I invited my broter inlaw and wife to meet us for dinner. The entrees were so disappointing ----- my seafood fettucine was tasteless. All portions were tiny for the money , especially the salmon and pasta dish . I have never seen anyone been served a 30$ piece of salmon that small. Everyone left still able to eat more and the bil was 188$ The money was not an issue and our server Spencer was very accomodating.

July 7, 2008|My husband enjoyed his steak,|3|My husband enjoyed his steak, but there was way too much butter on his potatoes so he could not eat them. I started with clam chowder that had no clams,2 potatoes and lots of bacon. I then had cashew crusted Tilapia w/Jamaican butter rum on top of rice pilaf. It was to spicy for me which i was not expecting. It also made the rice spicy. Since I did not like it the manager came over an appologized and explained why it had a kick to it(cayenne pepper). I was not upset about it and was happy he took the time to explain. My husband and I were very surprised that they removed it from the bill. That usually only happens when you complain. For the amount I'm spending i expect more so i'm not sure if i would go back. Maybe i'll try something else.
July 7, 2008|Our table wasn't ready when|2|Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, but after refusing a seat at the bar for a drink, one magically appeared. It was one of about ten empty tables. Hmmm. n Neither the hostess, who gave us regular menus, nor the waitress, mentioned Providence Restaurant Week, the very reason that we were there. (We have been to several restaurants for Boston Restaurant Week and this has never happened.) In addition, there was NO PRINT OUT for the menu; when I asked about restaurant week, the hostess said that she would give us all the choices orally, as did the waitress. Finally, the menu was not the same as it appeared on-line, which was, again, the reason we were there. Bait and switch? It would appear so.
July 1, 2008|The food was very good.  The|4|The food was very good. The only complaint would be that courses came to quickly together. There was no time inbetween courses to sit and chat and relax before the next one. When I choose a fine dining restaurant I don't expect to be in and out in an hour and a half. I would have preferred to take my time dining.
June 28, 2008|Love this place, never disappoints.|4|Love this place, never disappoints. Great food and the bar is a happening place. Only downside is parking, they charge 2 dollars for 3 hrs, after that is shoots up to 15. We wanted to stay, but ran up against the 3 hr limit, so we left and went elsewhere for a drink. Hotel is in charge of parking, but should give patrons of M n S a better deal.

Chris M. was our server on our last visit (6/28/08)and was excellent. The General Manager even stopped by to ensure everything was up to our expectations.

The food was great. The stuffed shrimp and the cocunut shrimp were tasty and very tender. The filet Mignon and the Sirloin were cooked to perfection. Would I come back? MOST DEFINETELY. The entire staff at the restaurant were very attentive, kind and courteous. Thank you for the great dining experience! Tina McFee

We felt very special yet also as if we werepart of the regulars or family at the restaurant. I would highly recommend McCormick & Schmick's restaurant to all Providence visitors. My son and daughter-in-law are planning a weekend in Providence this summer and based on our experience will be dining at McCormick and Schmicks.

The appetizer was meticulously prepared and delicious. The main course was served promptly and both sumptuous and aesthetically pleasing. Our desert was heavenly. The only regrets we have was that my first choice dish was not available and that the people outside our window were transatives.

He certainly contributed to an enjoyable and memorable restaurant experience!!
June 14, 2008|Wonderful dining experience|5|Wonderful dining experience :: Outstanding grilled blackened Alaskan Halibut (Sitka Bay)! - Excellent ahi tuna appetizer - terrific house salad w/greens, blue cheese & walnuts- expansive list of wines by the glass - friendly attentive wait staff... A real gem in Providence for fresh seafood and a 5-star dining experience!!
June 13, 2008|A good and bad experience.|2|A good and bad experience. June 13th and no air-conditioning in the entire restaurant, service was good but one fish dinner under-cooked returned for more cooking and still came back under-cooked. (that's how under-cooked it was the first time) The othe dinner of salmon on risoto was outstanding! The staff did apologize for food and took care of desert which was also good. A nice place but an overall ok experience ...

May 22, 2008|Our waiter was wonderful.|4|Our waiter was wonderful. Had some problems with the dinner though. I was given an incorrect entre and had a silver wrapper, maybe gum, under the apple pie. The waiter replaced my entre with the salmon I had ordered but the other 3 in our party were almost finished with their meal when mine arrived. We were not charged for the dessert, but it was distressing. Again, the waiter was friendly and helpful. MAH
May 21, 2008|This was my first visit to|2|This was my first visit to the Providence M&S; I've been to others around the country and had very favorable experiences. This was not one of them. Service was sporadic and my entree was overcooked. Additionally, I did not like the ambience of this particular one. If I'm in the mood for seafood in the greater Providence area, Legals' Hemingways, and The Oyster Bar will get my repeat business before this resturant.

May 14, 2008|Our evening was great.  Each|5|Our evening was great. Each of the 4 diners in our group had a different meal and all were delicious. The waiter was very helpful in answering questions and making recommendations about the menu. The waiter was very attentive without being intrusive. I wish I could remember his name, he should be commended, he was great. Also it was our son's 25th birthday and our menus had happy 25th printed on them. Nice touch. This is a favorite restaurant of our son and his girlfriend and now of my husband and I as well. We'll be back.
May 11, 2008|Our waitress was fantastic!|5|Our waitress was fantastic! Not everyone grows up knowing how to trim a big tree! And her family sounds unique! Anyway, her recommendationsfor the seafood entrees were on target. My sister truly relished the Ahi plate. The plate presentations, size: pointed oval are unusual but fit the restaurant. Now, if the chef would share the carmelized apple pie recipe I'd be so appreciative! Husbands mahi-mahi was satifying to him and I think I can duplicate the scallop entree at home for a delicious memory. The fruit dessert ended the evening well. We'd return for any reason!
May 11, 2008|Everything was very good with|3|Everything was very good with the exception that some items on the menu ran out. The crab legs were gone very early and some of the desserts were not available for everyone. Staff was great
May 10, 2008|We were sat near the kitchen,so|3|We were sat near the kitchen,so it was very loud with a lot of traffic. My sister didn't like her wine and the waiter was happy to bring a different one. My Mom's steak was really fatty and veiny, she could barely cut it. It was taken off the bill with a table visit from a manager and she was also given free dessert. Our waiter went above and beyond he was friendly and gave great service. Overall, I would say our experience was enjoyable but I would not rush back.
May 9, 2008|The dining was fine.  All|3|"The dining was fine. All three of us enjoyed our food and thought the waiter was very good. I have an issue with parking. The hotel had a prom that night. Valet parking was jammed. Two of us parked in the parking garage attached. That was a nightmare! I pulled in, there was a sign saying one token..except there were no tokens. I was backing out of the garage when a ""security guard"" showed up to collect my $10 and give me two tokens. I parked. Had a lovely evening out with friends. My friend arrived at the exit in front of me. She deposited her token, nothing happened. Nobody to be seen - now what? She beeped her horn a few times. The security guard arrived. Muttered, banged the token box, used a key to open the gate. Ridiculous."
May 9, 2008|We were first seated under|4|We were first seated under a fan and I requested a different table. Our waiter (who ended up not waiting on us) was wonderful about finding another table. The second waiter was equally as helpful. Great wait staff in our opinion! Another plus was the choice of differing size glasses of wine. This would allow the pairing of a more correct wine with course choices. We haven't seen this at other in-town restaurants.
May 5, 2008|We dined here for our anniversary.|5|We dined here for our anniversary. Even the special menu congratulated us for our 19 years of marriage! Everyone treated us with extra special attention. We loved the choices for every course so had difficulty making a decision. My husband loved his oysters while I had a huge shrimp cocktail. Our waiter made suggestions of specials which all sounded amazing. My husband raved about the chilean sea bass while I feasted on a decadent stuffed salmon. My husband was very pleased with the wine by the glass as I don't drink. Our dessert was perfect little tarts that melted in our mouths. We will definitely return here as the manager mentioned Tuesday night bar specials on oysters. Also we joined a dining club which will give us more great dining!
Dined on May 4, 2008|The food was well prepared,|3|The food was well prepared, the ambiance charming and the service very friendly, but incredibly slow. It appeared our waiter had to tend tables on opposite sides of the dining room making for a very inefficient work flow. It was nearly impossible to find assistance when we needed it. I'm not at all sure the staff could handle a busy day which is why we will be dining at a nearby restaurant on my daughter's graduation day in 2 weeks. That being said, the food was great, we've been to this site many times i the past and will return, when we have all day to spend for lunch. We always look for McCormick & Schmick's restaurants when we travel, as a rule you do not disappoint.
May 3, 2008|Service was a little too quick.|4|Service was a little too quick. I would rather have more time when looking at the menu. Felt like I was rushed. Also appetizer and main course was very close together. I didn't really get to enjoy a 5 minute break in between.
May 2, 2008|As Trinity club ticket holders,|5|As Trinity club ticket holders, we often dine in Providence prior to attending shows and we always choose McCormick & Schmick's in Providence. The food has always been excellent and the service superb. The waitstaff are friendly, attentive and always helpful. Luis (our server on 3/8/08) and Chris M. (our server on 5/2/08) are truly notable. During our last visit the chef stopped by as we were ordering and offered to create a dish that wasn't even on the menu. Truly remarkable service! I had asked to speak to the manager that night to pay complements to his team but unfortunately we were running late for our show and had to leave. I'm hoping this message gets to him/her. We are happy to be a Preferred Guest card holder.
May 1, 2008|I felt that the ambience could|3|I felt that the ambience could improve with tablecloths. Also our waiter delivered our food, then needed to wait for his manager to unlock the wine, so that he could deliver it. Also a very loud noise occurred due to the hotel's elevator and made finishing completely out of the question.
April 30, 2008|Some confusion on who was|5|Some confusion on who was our waiter. Got us involved. waiter asked if someone else had talked to us. Like his table was being stolen They should decide amongst themselves who will wait on us and keep us out of it. I shouldn't know. The food was outstanding. As always. Loved the stuffed clams, scallops, salmon was great, First time at this one, Have been to both Boston restaurants,and denver and San Francisco. Consistent great food. Definately will be back. I don't like the way my points on my McCormick's. I didn't really understand how to redeem points. I keep forgetting to bring my card when I come, so I've been there many more times. Oh Well. I'll try harder. Don't worry, we'll be back. Love the food.
April 27, 2008|We greatly enjoy going out|5|We greatly enjoy going out to eat here. They have a wonderful fresh seafood menu, and the food is always prepared excellant. We dine with our 5 year old & our servers have always been cordial & accomodating. I highly recommend this restaurant to our friends & family. They also have a Preferred Guest program which I participate in. This really makes it nice.
April 19, 2008|Dinner was great, the fish|4|Dinner was great, the fish was very fresh, which is what they promote. Theor menu is printed 2 times a day, as they get the fish selections in they update the menu.

April 12, 2008|The food was good, the service|2|The food was good, the service almost non-existant. Once we got our entree, the waitress didn't show up again until it was time to pay the bill. The resturant was very hot, (temperature)and it was an average experience at best.

April 10, 2008|Our sever was very nice, but|3|Our sever was very nice, but extremely slow, even after we told him that we needed to be somewhere and what time we needed to leave. There was a hair in our creme brulee, the manager was very nice and took it anf a round of drniks off the bill, but there is NO excuse for hair in food, that's what hair nets are for.
April 10, 2008|i informed our waiter i was|2|i informed our waiter i was Deathly Alergic to all seafood and my food could not touch or be cooked near or on the same grill or fry pans as any other seafood. I ordered Buffalo Chicken strips that came w/ fried onion rings that are fried with the same batter and oils as seafood so informed the waiter and told him i could not have any garnishments like the onion strips on my Filet and mashed potato's. I never got my salad and the food came out i told the waiter to forget the Wedge then a 3 minutes later he came back to check in and i asked him if my $40 filet came out with fried onion stips that were done seperately or if they were put in with the Calamari and other seafood. I had to wait over 10 min while the other 3 people ate for a new 1

April 10, 2008|My wife and I enjoyed dining|4|My wife and I enjoyed dining at this restaurant very much and the food was delicious. Our waiter was very attentive and made some good suggestions. The apple dessert was really great too! We have dined at a few other McCormick and Schmick's as well- Boston and Indianapolis and they too have been a very pleasant experience. We will definately return again!
April 10, 2008|When we attend theater this|4|When we attend theater this is our favorite restaurant. Since we drive down from west of Boston, we appreciate one-stop parking for dinner and curtain. Your entries are varied and reasonably priced. Getting away from the bar end results in acceptable, although not excellent, sound limits. Our waitress was exceptional, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and with a fine sense of timing and attention. Conversation from the kitchen could be muted. I don't think kitchen workers realize how loud their conversation (not related to food) is and how intrusive it can be. Dick Shohet
March 29, 2008|Understaffed.  Waited 40 minutes|3|Understaffed. Waited 40 minutes for a table when we had a reservation. Am very familiar with the chain where I have had excellent food and service--but this one falls seriously short.
March 29, 2008|Overall a good dining experience.|4|Overall a good dining experience. Our waitress was very good. The whole restaurant smelled like fish, so the aroma was a bit overpowering- don't know if that can be helped since it is a seafood restaurant after all... The crab and shrimp tater tots and the upside down apple pie with the candied walnut crust were fabulous.

The service, food, particularly the desserts are amazing. We absolutely loved the buffet set up for Easter and our waiter was terrific. It is so nice to go to McCormick & Schmick's. Thanks so much. Mamie Horstmann
March 23, 2008|I was pleased with the brunch|3|I was pleased with the brunch offering. The Prime rib was the best I've had out ever. It was cooked to perfection! The staff was very friendly and prompt with the service. I was taken back by the cost of the vermosa's $8 each was a bit steep for my taste. This was my only complaint. Overall I would return to try the food on the menu, I'm surprised that they didn't put any seafood other than samon on the buffet.
March 23, 2008|We had a very nice Easter|5|We had a very nice Easter Sunday Brunch for 6 - including two grandmothers and two children. Service was excellent - attentive, prompt and friendly. Nice atmosphere and not noisy given the fact it was Easter Sunday and relatively crowded. Food was well prepared and very good. We would definitely eat here again for a holiday brunch or for dinner.
March 22, 2008|Our service was poor we sat|3|Our service was poor we sat for close to 25 minutes before a waiter even came to take our order. He also did not clear dishes when we were done with app's.....He forgot the leftovers and had to have the kitchen remake (supposedly) the food to take home. Probably would not go back again....

March 16, 2008|Took my sister here for her|4|Took my sister here for her birthday. We had a small group of 4 people. Everything we ordered was outstanding. We had a waitress named Candy who exceeded restaurant service expectations by far. My family likes to joke around a bit and she was right in the swing of things with us. She was also extremely informative about menu choices and selections. She was one of the best waitresses that I have ever come across. Even though everyone in our party was full to maximum capacity, she brought out a piece of cake with happy birthday written on the plate and 4 spoons for all of us to share. What a great dinner and we will definately be going back again and requesting Candy as our waitress.

March 15, 2008|My mother in-laws double crown|4|My mother in-laws double crown with diet coke in a tall glass came 1st as a diet coke only, 2nd in a smaller glass with what she thought was a single shot. and 3rd still a smaller glass and still weak like the second one. My Samuels Adams draft was re-ordered however it missed the entire appetiser consumption of calamari. Bread was asked for at the time the main entres were being served. This was awkward. Oh one more thing we ate at another McCormick store the day before in Boston. So we are familar with McCormick's standards. Thought you would like to know.
September 29, 2007|Good, but should be better|3|It's OK, but not on par with so many of the other wonderful restaurants in close proximity. Admittedly, I am not the biggest seafood fan, so I rely on my lovely wife's opinion. She feels that they could and should do much, much better - given the prices and atmosphere (which offer the perception of excellence). As with many things, when perception vs. reality, the latter leaves you feeling cheated.
March 14, 2007|Traditional rather stuffy|4|Traditional rather stuffy restaurant in downtown Providence at the Biltmore Hotel. Menu was good, prices were on the higher side. Service was average. Probably a good place to take clients to talk about business.
