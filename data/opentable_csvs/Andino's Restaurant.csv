ays ago|Favorite restaurant on Federal Hill!|4|Favorite restaurant on Federal Hill!
ays ago|Culinary heaven|5|We were in Providence for a college basketball game. We made a reservation for 6:30 and arrived 10 minutes early and we were seated promptly. My son and I ordered Sinarta Sangrias which were excellent. Our friend had scotch . We did not order appetizers because we knew the entrees would be large. We each ordered pasta dishes and they were delicious, particularly the linguine with red clam sauce. One of the meals had linguine, Alfredo , prosciutto, bacon and large green peas. Outstanding. The service was on point and the atmosphere was warm and friendly. This was a Wednesday evening and it was very busy, which was understandable since this place is incredible . Make sure to make a reservation and arrive hungry. Andinos is a gem.
February 20, 2016|Way too squished!|3|The eggplant was slimey and like one wet lump of eggplant instead of nicely breaded stack that I was expecting. I ordered a specific table a month in advance and did not get it. I know it can't always be honored but there were six of us and we were ll crowded into a table for four! The restaurant is extremely loud! The service was prompt, so prompt actually we were out of there in about an hour! A little too fast for me. Overall I wouldn't go back!
February 19, 2016|Excellent food, excellent service!|5|First time there and it was a wonderful experience! We'll definitely return again!
February 19, 2016|GREAT PLACE!|5|I took my husband for a birthday dinner. Andino's is a lively place with great service and very good food! Our awesome waiter, Eric, was very friendly and attentive and answered all of our questions regarding menu items. We never felt rushed and really enjoyed ourselves. My husband was even surprised with a birthday desert compliments of the restaurant! Definitely recommend Andino's and will return again soon!
February 18, 2016|Wonderful food and service!|1|This was our second time at Andinos and it was better than the first. The Pasta Fagioli soup is as good as my grandmothers!! The service is great.
February 18, 2016|Great staff and food.|4|Every order can be customized to your liking. Valet parking is very convent and quick. Staff is very knowledgeable.
February 15, 2016|Past favorite|3|"Discovered Andino's about 4 years ago quickly became my favorite place in RI. I live about 45-50min ride away. So myself and wife usually get there 2-3 times per year. I started bringing my family after my first visit usually 6 people. The favorite app. Of myself wife, son and grandson is the calamari. My favorite entre is the eggplant parm. This past week we brought some friends. I recommended the Calamari and Eggplant. Our friends had commented over drinks that they enjoyed Eggplant Parm. So they ordered the Eggplant Parm and we all shared an order of calamari (4 adults). I got to say the quality of both were as good as ever but I was extremely disappointed in the portion size. In the past the eggplant was about 4"" high and 8-10"" long. I was surprised to see 3 dishes of eggplant about 1"" high, wow how much does it cost for eggplant ($.79 lb?). I hadn't gotten the Eggplant my last visit tried something else. But in the past I couldn't finish the portion, I certainly had no problem finishing this portion. Our last few visits I've noticed that the calamari portion is getting smaller and smaller. We usually spend approx. $50+ per person which I expect but expect something for my money. I've seen other restaurants do the same thing, so i just find another place to spend my money. I say charge $1.00 more if you have to but don't change what makes you special.....The food quality an portion size (value). I doubt we'll ever go back and I certainly won't recommend Andino's again."
February 14, 2016|Excellent pasta!!|5|Great fettuccine alfredo. Excellent server gave us a complimentary cheescake for dessert.
February 14, 2016|Fantastic Food, Yet Lack of Space Cramps Style|3|I live right off of Federal Hill and have been coming to Federal Hill for years. I firmly believe that Andino's has the best dinner on the hill from a pure taste perspective. However, the ambiance is an entirely different story. I took my girlfriend to a Valentine's Day dinner at Andino's because of how spectacular the food is. Upon arriving at the restaurant, there were literally five tables jammed together in a space where there should have been three at the most. I understand the desire to capitalize on a lucrative opportunity such as Valentine's Day. However, the space was so restricted that we felt like we could not relax and I had to ask a woman at another table to adjust her body every time I needed to leave the table. There was one specific instance where a waiter accidentally bumped into our table because of how limited the space was. The table actually lifted off of the ground and our meals as well as our drinks nearly flew all over us. Luckily that did not happen. I understand that mistakes happen, that is not what frustrated me. The reason the waiter bumped into our table was because there were so many people squeezed into an exceedingly small space. I adore the food and stand by that. However, I felt that the restaurant valued the quantity of people attending the restaurant and maximizing revenue rather than providing a romantic and comfortable experience for their customers. As a consumer, I believe that should always be most important.
February 14, 2016|Great night|5|Fantastic food and great service. What could be better.
February 14, 2016|Valentine's Date|5|My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on Valentine's Day. We wanted to go for dinner but everything past 1 oclock was booked, and I can see why! The food was excellent and the service was very good. The only negative thing I would have to say is that the restaurant is kind of small, but that also created a more intimate dining experience for us.
February 13, 2016|A good find in Providence, RI|4|We were seated on time, very attentive service and the food was tasty.
February 13, 2016|Fun night out|5|Let me start off by saying the service here is AWESOME! From the bartenders to the servers. We had Laura as our server and she was nothing short of fantastic! Even with a rowdy party she was very attentive and always checking on us and ensuring ours drinks and food were as ordered (as we went off the menu a bit). Can't wait to go back and hopefully Laura will be there again. A note to the restaurant PLEASE make the cocotin a menu item! It's the best cocktail!!!
February 13, 2016|Always a great experience|5|Eric was our waiter and served us well! He accommodated my gluten free request and offered options for me. He is always pleasant. Generous portions. I had shrimp scampi with gluten free pasta, my husband had pasta with sausage. Appetizers were clams casino (the best around!) and a house salad. One of the best restaurants on Federal Hill.
February 13, 2016|Great food and atmosphere!|5|Great food and atmosphere!
February 12, 2016|Always good|4|Best food on Federal Hill. Reasonably priced. Efficient valet parking . Wine selection has improved recently, but still a bit limited. A few too many tables crammed into a limited space in the winter when outdoor option is not available. Overall a really good , consistent , place for dinner. We have been going 5-6 times a year since about 2007.
February 12, 2016|Andino's|5|Server Kendra was very attentive; not pushy, but there when you needed her.
February 11, 2016|Andino's never has let me down.  If I am...|5|Andino's never has let me down. If I am in Providence, it is my first choice on Federal Hill. This last visit I took two workmates with me, they asked afterwards why I have not taken them there in the last 5 years! (We do shows in Providence in February and March every year). (Answer is I am not in charge!). Nothing on the menu from appetizer to dessert will disappoint, my favorites are the marsala and parmigiana (veal or chicken), but the specials rule too! Portobello Casino was a great start this last meal! If you want great food and great value, Andinos it is!

January 31, 2016|I have never had a bad service experienc...|2|"I have never had a bad service experience at Andinos until last Sunday. We arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation, only to be seated 10 minutes late. We sat down and ordered appetizers, which took over 20 minutes to receive. Our waiter pressed us to order our main course before the appetizers arrived and throughout eating them. Finally, the waiter came over to us and rudely said ""Look, I'm gonna be 100% straight with you. We have a 2 hr dining limit. There is someone coming at that limit that wants your table so you will have to be done by then"". Never in my life have I experienced that level of rudeness and treatment. We spent $300 and I was taking my parents to a nice birthday meal, only to be scolded for taking our time. We proceeded to order our main course right then, which took 30 minutes to receive. We had 5 minutes to spare between us finishing our meals and the next reservation. Look, I get it, there are two hour table limits which I was aware of and we understood. We weren't going to go past the time limit. However the waiter was extremely rude and ruined the meal. Very disappointed."
January 30, 2016|Another Fablous Birthday Dinner at Andion's|5|Having celebrated a few other friend's birthday's at Andino's I knew I had to set up another reservation for our group of friends for our January Birthday celebration. Once again, they did not disappoint! Our table was ready as soon as we got there, our waitress was awesome, food was delicious and prepared quickly! No complaints!! I will be returning and recommending!
January 30, 2016|Undecided|3|The food was excellent, our waiter was excellent. However it was extremely noisy. We were a table of two couples and we had to SCREAM to talk to each other. We also felt very rushed throughout our meal. We felt like we were being pushed out the door. Not sure if we'll return,
January 30, 2016|Disappointing|2|"From Boston, and federal hill is the ""north end"" of Boston, in Providence. Food was middle of the road at best, small dining area, service was okay at best but not outstanding."
January 24, 2016|Classic Italian|3|The Andino's menu had great variety. We went there for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. I follow a minimal grains, dairy and sugar diet and the restaurant easily accommodated my needs to have no bread crumbs or lemon butter sauce on the baked scrod. The fish was not overcooked or charred. Our server told us that everything was made to order. My boyfriend felt that his veal was missing something. Other than that we had a good experience. Although we did not tell the wait staff it was his birthday, the restaurant will sing to you upon request.
January 22, 2016|The BEST food!|5|Seriously great food...perfect portions. I had a lemony chicken with capers and we split an antipasto.
January 22, 2016|Birthday dinner at Andino's|5|Service was excellent. Everything we ordered tasted great - we had the calamari, broiled steak, strawberry sangria, and stuffed shrimp. The atmosphere was a little bit loud, but that was expected for a Friday night at a Federal Hill restaurant. We really enjoyed the staff and how helpful everyone was.
January 22, 2016|Great atmosphere, food and service!|5|Great atmosphere, food and service!
January 22, 2016|1st date|5|Restaurant was nice the staff was knowlegable I was looking for a romantic table and asked for that when I made the reservation but I didn't get that and in there defense I didn't really se a location in the restaurant that fit that bill. Overall experience was very good. Alot of which was my date being awsome. Just saying
January 3, 2016|Not a great experience|1|The temperature at the restaurant was too cold. They sat us at a table near the bar. Between the front door opening and the door that leads to their upstairs it was an unpleasant experience. It wasn't until the end of the night that the management turned up the heat to 68. Still cold in my opinion.
January 2, 2016|Fine Dining Experience|5|Had a wonderful dining experience at Andino's. Both the food and service were top notch. It was a busy Saturday night and we actually arrived a bit early and they had our table ready to go. One of our party mentioned to hostess how hungry they were and as soon as we sat down the waitress came right over and said she heard about the hungry group and was ready to take our order. Now that is attention to detail that you don't see much anymore. Already can't wait to go back
January 1, 2016|Favorite spot on Federal Hill|5|By far my favorite restaurant on Federal Hill. Have had many lunches and dinners here to celebrate all types of milestones. Services is always great and food outstanding. You always have to hear the specials before making a decision. There sangria is also delicious! Looking forward to many more meals here!
January 1, 2016|Excellent food, excellent service!|5|Four dinners, one salad, three desserts and a nice bottle of Merlot -- all for $140. Definitely worth the price. Even my 92 year old father loved his meal, and he doesn't like much! We will visit again.
December 31, 2015|A Wonderful Experience|5|"This was our second New Year's Dinner at Andino's and it was spectacular. The appetizer and both entrees were wonderful and plentiful. You have no choice but to bring some home since no human can consume that much food in one sitting no matter how delicious. I can't finish without mentioning the excellent sangrias we enjoyed during our meal. Adam, our waiter was terrific as well. An all around ""Wonderful Experience""."

December 20, 2015|Italian Delight|5|Wonderful evening out. The service was superior. The entire staff helps one another to make a pleasant delightful dining experience. The food is authentic Italian. The portions are huge and so scrumptious it's hard to put into words. The price is very reasonable given size of the dishes. You want Italian food with an old world atmosphere this Federal Hill gem is the place to go. One dinner at Andino's and you'll never eat at one of those fake Italian chain restaurants again.
December 19, 2015|Birthday Dinner|5|Another great dinner at Andino's!! Our waitress, MJ was very helpful with suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed. Will return and recommend to others!

December 18, 2015|Great food|5|The food portions were extremely generous & the food was absolutely delicious. The service was excellent thanks to our server Adam. We travel from Connecticut, it is worth the trip.
December 16, 2015|Three Course Christmas Lunch|4|Food delicious as always and the three courses for $15.95 was a solid value for the quality of the food. Lentil soup, Calamari, and Rigatoni Bolognaise were all delicious.
December 9, 2015|Gluten Free and Friendly|5|We have been dining at Andino's for years and even before the Gluten Free craze, the have always been accommodating. Now they even offer GF Pasta which, my dining mates stated tasted just like theirs. Thanks Andino's for being my not-so-neighborhood favorite. I will always find a way to dine at your establishment when I'm in the area.
December 4, 2015|Another Great Dinner At Andino's|5|This was our 5th trip to Providence and our 5th trip to Andino's - we never miss it. The place is simply fantastic - from the appetizers thru the entrees and desserts. The staff is the most attentive of any restaurant I have ever been to and our waiter, Brian, who we asked for, was great again as always. Don't miss this place if you are in Providence.

November 20, 2015|Andino's is a must go to restaurant.|5|I once again had the pleasure of dining at this incredible restaurant. Our reservation was ready upon arrival. The staff are incredibly kind. The service was amazing, timely, attentive and caring. The food was no less than amazing. Andinos is bar far our favorite place to dine.
November 15, 2015|Food was very good and proportions were large.|5|The food and service at Andino's was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who comes to RI or someone looking for good food. The only negative to this restaurant is the size - very small and patrons are very close to each other. We had a great table in the front of the restaurant to accommodate 7 people but noticed that everyone else was wedged in.
November 11, 2015|Classic Federal Hill|4|I love Andino's. One of my 2-3 favorites on the Hill. Food quality is always excellent. Seating is a little tight, but it is Federal Hill after all. In my opinion, prices are slightly on the high end for a lunch, but at the end of the day, the quality justifies the price.
November 7, 2015|Service was great,  food was good, sat d...|2|Service was great, food was good, sat down very promptly with our reservation but this restaurant is too crowded and too noisy. I had to put energetic on survey but it was not, it was too noisy, we could not hear ourselves talk.
November 7, 2015|I thought Andino's was excellent.  I am ...|4|I thought Andino's was excellent. I am very picky when it comes to Italian food and I was pleasantly surprised. Our family of 6 met for dinner and everyone enjoyed their meal. Laura our waitress was great and extremely attentive. I only have one complaint. My 10 year old niece ordered shrimp scampi. She found a big piece of wire in her food and asked what she should do with it. The manager did come over and apologized and offered her a new meal. She quietly reclined and said no that is okay. He did bring her a free dessert later, which I thought was very nice. After the fact, and and also having been in the restaurant business, I think he should have taken the meal off the bill instead of a free dessert. Other than that I will definitely be returning.
November 3, 2015|Delicious real italian|5|Tues night good crowd of people Always consistently good food Staff servers very attentive Great night Thanks
October 25, 2015|Food great|4|Food was very good. Was not to happy on where table was. Had to pull out a little to not bump right elbow on stone wall.
October 25, 2015|Not Impressed|2|Place is small and very crowded and busy. The reviews were great so we gave it a try but not impressed with our choices. Calamari was a little overcooked, good but not great. My daughter liked her gnocchi, my husband's steak was just ok. I ordered the scrod italiano which was horrible, tasted boiled with bland tomato slices and boiled green bell peppers thrown on top with half a bottle of oregano. Waitress came by a couple times and asked I told her I didn't like it and she just walked away. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food and service especially when there are some fantastic places down the street with lower prices and much better quality and service. Sorry won't return here.
October 23, 2015|Consistent|4|Good Italian food. Service prompt and staff friendly and attentive.
October 22, 2015|Great Veal!|5|Most of our party of 6 had veal dishes and all were terrific. We enjoyed our meals including the nice Italian bread with dipping oil.
October 19, 2015|Good Place on the Hill for Lunch or Dinner.|5|It has been a while since I have been to Andino's. I was pleased with the lunch and the service. It is like a step back in time. Great place, Great service and the food is done the way we Italian's like .
October 18, 2015|Disappointing dinner|1|Starting with appetizer, clams casino was a dried out clam with mushy stuffing in a shell. No taste whatsoever. Entree, chicken cacciatore was 3 boneless pieces of almost poached chicken with long strips of peppers and sauce. Wasn't that tasty. My daughter had chicken piccata and the chicken wasn't nicely sautéed and sauce sub par. Only good thing about meal was the wine( they didn't make it) and the server can't be blamed for what the kitchen is sending out. Couldn't wait to leave for 122 dollars, meal should have been better.
October 18, 2015|Loved the special-- tortellini with baby...|5|Loved the special-- tortellini with baby shrimp that were actually larger than expected and lots of them, and all portion sizes were enough to film up my 2 sons in their '20s who are always hungry. Everyone said everything was delicious.
October 17, 2015|Awesome experience|5|Enjoyed an early dinner on Family weekend for JWU. The wait staff were wonderful and they were very accommodating. Love the fried calamari!
October 17, 2015|Amazing|5|Great lunch special! We were treated like we were the only customers in the crowded restaurant. Excellent service
October 13, 2015|My new favorite restaurant on the hill!|5|I wish I had tried this place sooner! Great friendly staff all around. The food was delicious. It's a small place, so I wouldn't recommend it for a group larger than 4 or 5 people. The Sinatra was playing at just the right volume that it created good atmosphere, but was soft enough that you could easily converse. I love this place!
October 12, 2015|Exploring on Columbus Day|5|We have dined on Federal Hill many times but never went to Andino's. It was a great fine. The day was beautiful and festive. There was food everywhere on the street and it all smelled so good but my husband does not like to eat standing. I made reservations for Andino's and was very impressed. We had veal parmesan which was fork tender with an authentic Italian sauce, so delicious. Our wait staff was excellent. She was attentive without being intrusive. She made very good suggestions about the wine. I would ask for Desi again when we go back for the veal. I would highly recommend this excellent Italian Federal Hill restaurant.
October 10, 2015|Love the food, love the restaraunt, love...|5|Love the food, love the restaraunt, love the service. The place is awesom, especially the lunch special.
October 3, 2015|70th birthday celebration|3|Our reservation was right on. In fact they were waiting at the door for us (we were a little early). However, our reservation for 5 was very obviously put at a table for 4. It was extremely crowded but we made the best of it. As it was my husband's 70th birthday celebration he felt entitled to order the rather expensive veal special which was not that special after all. Veal was served very rare (he ordered medium rare) so he ate very little and brought the rest home. Reheated it was much better and the way he would have liked it. Everyone else enjoyed their meals: veal marsala, fish & chips, linq. w/clam sauce, chicken parm. all very good. The service was great. Server was very personable. Atmosphere was good.
October 2, 2015|Our 55 year anniversary .|5|We knew that our 55th was special and a great dinner would make the end of a perfect day. Andino's Food and service did that. We can't say enough about our server Brian. Looking forward to our next dinner.
October 1, 2015|Overall excellent!|5|We requested a room off to the side and we got it! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, visit and experience. Thank you!
September 30, 2015|I had the gnocchi and it was very stodgy.|3|You say that the review must be at least 50 characters in length but in fact it could be no MORE than 50 characters.
September 30, 2015|Highly recommend|5|I don't normally give reviews but this place was so good I couldn't help but try to spred the word about andinos. Food is ridiculously good and server was so personable and professional. don't overlook this place you won't be disappointed!
September 27, 2015|Awesome restaurant!|5|When returning to Providence after the Patriots game, we ate at Andinos upon someone's recommendation . We were both very pleasantly surprised at how great the food was. The staff here is also so friendly and accommodating. I had the baked stuffed shrimp, the stuffing was probably the best I have ever had. My husband could not decide between the eggplant or chicken parmigiana and decided to ask our waiter his opinion. The waiter said they could do half and half ,and it was absolutely delicious. We look forward to coming back here when we are in town again.
September 26, 2015|Always a good night|5|Andino's never disappoints. We had our favorite server, Laura, and the food was wonderful as always. We were just a little disappointed to be seated in the back room almost directly in front of the door leading to the terrace. The traffic was constant and the night chilly so it was not very comfortable. But the food and service went a long way to make up for that.
September 19, 2015|Decent Italian food fro the price in this area|3|In this neighborhood the food can be pricey and even overpriced but this place has the right combo.
September 19, 2015|Disappointed|2|I went into the restaurant really wanting a steak. I know it's an Italian restaurant, but a steak or veal chop was on my mind. They had equipment failure and couldn't sell me a steak or chop because they couldn't cook it. I would think that if a restaurant can't serve a whole portion of their menu they would make some amends for not being able to do so. Also, they charged an outrageous price for their shrimp cocktail. It was fresh, but not huge. And really what does it take to serve shrimp cocktail? And presentation was poor all around.
September 19, 2015|A must try|5|Went to dinner Saturday night to celebrate our anniversary. We had reservations which I highly recommend. The waitress came over to greet us and brought two glasses of champagne for us on the house. I thought that was a nice touch. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant.
September 19, 2015|I'd Return to Andino's In A Heartbeat!!|5|"I loved everything about Andino's! First there was valet parking, yea!! The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating .. a plus. The atmosphere is calm with a beautiful mural of Italy. The tables are close together but not infringing. The staff was very friendly and our waitress was very personable, reliable and helpful especially explaining the drink menu. You MUST delve into one of their LEMONADE drink or their SANGRIA (the BEST I've ever tasted) ... both are extremely delicious!!! The menu offerings were plentiful yet not overwhelming. My Veal Marsala was tender and the sauce divine. The ""gravy"" on the Pene pasta was extremely tasty with small chunks of beef/veal/sausage ... to die for!!! Others enjoyed Meatballs and Chicken Parmesan which were all above average. Don't miss out on this gem!!"
September 18, 2015|Great Place classic Federal Hill Italian dinner|4|Met another couple for dinner and drinks and had a great time. We have been there many times and went there for dinner Friday night. We enjoy it every time. Outstanding Calamari, great cocktails, and excellent service. Take advantage of Valet there as parking is tough otherwise and only costs you a tip. I had the off the menu Chicken Parmesan stuffed with eggplant and it was great. Large portions - only ate half and enjoyed it 2 days later for lunch. Bartenders were very professional.

Dined on September 15, 2015|Overrated|3|When we walked in we smelled smoke. The host said that was from people smoking outside. Well it smelled inside. There was also smoking in the bar area. The food was average at best. I don't know where it got 4 1/2 stars on open table.
September 12, 2015|Packed in like sardinnes|2|There is not enough room for all the tables they have squished in to the available space. We reserved a table for five a week in advance, and the fifth member of our party was basically out in the aisle. Very mixed reviews on the food. Chicken francaise was great, steak was overdone and lacked flavor except for WAY too much garlic. Chicken marsala overly sweet.
September 11, 2015|The veal bone-in chop was cooked perfect...|3|The veal bone-in chop was cooked perfectly, but the sauces (pink sauce & red sauce) were not that exciting. Our table location was disappointing, we were right by the server station with a rock wall dividing our seats. The restaurant is really tight & it seemed like the table was just throw in for 2 more seats.
September 11, 2015|Andino's great as always,  wonderful service|4|They have ambitious, not-seen-every-day specials, which is fun. Preparation is spot on, service is outstanding. Fortunate to have Brian again as our server, he is a gem.

September 5, 2015|Fabulous Food!|4|It was a busy night on Federal Hill, so we had to wait 15 minutes for our 7:30 reservation, but it was definitely worth the wait. You will not be disappointed if you go here for the food. Each of our four entrees were delicious. We had the fried mozzarella and the stuffed squash blossoms as appetizers, I recommend them both. We ate inside were the noise level was HIGH, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a romantic night out, but it was certainly a lot of fun. We will return.
September 4, 2015|An Old Friend|5|I have been a loyal customer for about 10 years and I always describe Andino's to friends as having the kind of food your grandmother would serve you. Is it the fanciest, trendiest place on the hill - no, but it is great food and great service at reasonable prices. The food is all prepared to order - so if you don't like an ingredient, they'll make it special for you. The staff is exceptional. They make you feel like a regular on your first visit.
August 29, 2015|Fantastic appetizers!|4|We recently celebrated my birthday on a Saturday evening outdoors on the patio. Everything was great, from the Italian music, to the church scape in the background, and the tables are well spaced. It was conducive to conversation with our party of six. Our waiter was pleasant and gave excellent service.I highly recommend the stuffed squash flowers that were delicious and full of the flavors of lemon, wine, butter, prosciutto and mozzarella. The fried calamari was very tender and flavorful. We were a little disappointed in the fish entrees ordered as they were a bit dry, so specify the fish to be medium rare. Overall, we enjoyed a memorably delicious dinner with terrific ambiance. Be sure to walk the area!
August 29, 2015|Awesome Server and Great Food|4|"Stopped in earlier in the day to check out the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised to see they had patio dining. Hostess was more than helpful; explaining the challenge with updating our reservation to patio dining. They set aside 2 hours of service but if we were willing to ""rush"" through our dining in 90 minutes we could eat outdoors. We had no issue with the 90 minutes BUT we ended up arriving 15 minutes late (just before they would have had to give our table away). Phew! Even with just over an hour to dine we had a great experience. Never felt rushed. Our server was awesome; providing the perfect balance of attention and humor. We had the Fish and chips; Shrimp Fra Diablo an Chicken Caesar Salad. Everything was very good. The only complaint is that there was too much chicken in the salad; which, in the scheme of things isn't really a negative!!"
August 29, 2015|Go no further...|5|If you are in Providence, head to Andino's on Federal Hill for an experience that you will treasure. You leave wanting more and looking forward to the next occasion to celebrate there.
August 21, 2015|Great meal|4|Fabulous food and Ernie was a wonderful waiter. Thanks.
August 20, 2015|The food is great but on a weekend it's ...|4|The food is great but on a weekend it's crazy loud and crowded. Go early in the week.
August 15, 2015|Cheerful, clean, comfortable.  We walked...|4|Cheerful, clean, comfortable. We walked in on a crowded day & they went all out to find us a table and make us feel comfortable.
August 15, 2015|Sat outside on the back patio on Sat nig...|4|Sat outside on the back patio on Sat night. Great atmosphere, terrific service, very good food and the price is right! I'd highly recommend before the weather turns. Inside is always good too. Just a bit more crowded and high noise level. But everything else is just as good.
August 15, 2015|Water Fire hit!|5|Went here on a recommendation from a friend. It was a very romantic evening and I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking tie great Italian food.
August 14, 2015|Great experience|5|We made a reservation online for Andino's in Providence about two weeks before we visited the city. It was a beautiful Friday evening and as we entered the restaurant, we were hoping for an outside table. I told the hostess we had a reservation but not for outdoors. I asked if we could be given outdoor seating, and the friendly hostess found us a table for two. We had a waiter named Eric, who was excellent. Friendly, informative and sincere, Eric took great care of us all night. He patiently answered all of our questions and provided helpful hints about the menu. We started with the red sangria (Frank Sinatra) and it was excellent. We also had an appetizer of clams casino, and it was perfectly breaded and quite tasty. My meal was a special for the evening which consisted of various shellfish ( jumbo shrimp, mussels, clams and bay scallops) served on linguine with a fra diavlo sauce. This was very well prepared and quite delicious. My wife had shrimp scampi and she loved her meal as well. Our evening at Andino's was very enjoyable and we look forward to going back when we return to Providence this winter. If you are looking for a place with great ambiance, excellent food and thoughtful wait staff then Andino's is a must.
August 14, 2015|Great lunch - great service|5|We wanted a relaxing lunch and were not disappointed. WE started with a stuffed squash blossom - very tasty. Then calamari salad and Sicilian tuna salad were both very tasty and good sized portions. Overall we had a great lunch and will be back.
August 13, 2015|Amazing!|5|The food is incredible, the service is wonderful, the feel is romantic yet friendly. Such a great experience every time!
August 9, 2015|Travis|4|This was my third visit to Andino's. The food was very good, service was good, staff was friendly. Only complaint is that tables were too close together for comfort, maybe trying to get too many diners in the space. But would/will not hesitate to return or to recommend.
August 2, 2015|First visit|5|Came across Andino's on OpenTable and decided to try it. The service was fantastic, the portions were very large, and the food was delicious! We will definitely go back!
August 1, 2015|Birthday Dinner|5|Another great meal and service!! A definite favorite!! A 16th Birthday dinner for our daughter and few friends, everything was fantastic!
August 1, 2015|Great  service, cocktails and food|5|The fried smelt and stuffed squash blossoms were to die for. Great cocktail selection, too. Our server was extremely knowledgable and the service was excellent.
August 1, 2015|Charming Local Italian Restaurant with Great Food|4|Great local spot with very friendly staff. I felt right at home. The food was also delicious-- I had the Chicken Saltimbocca with a stuffed squash appetizer. Both were ample and delicious-- don't count on losing any weight if you eat here. Prices were more than reasonable too! The place is clean and has neighborly charm, but is not 'fancy.' It's also (understandably) very busy on weekends and can be a bit boisterous -- inviting, but not very romantic.
July 31, 2015|As always the food and service is unbeat...|5|As always the food and service is unbeatable
July 26, 2015|A lucky find|4|I found this restaurant on open table. I was going to be in the area for teo nights. It was walking distance from the hotel and that seemed perfect. They saved us a great window table. The service was good and all of the employees were very friendly. We had two pasta dishes and we both enjoyed them. If I was in the area again I world definitely go back
July 25, 2015|Delicious food|5|Food was delicious! I recommend the Chicken Parmesan it the best. Our waiter was Ernie. He provided excellent service throughout the night. We come from ct just to go there.
July 19, 2015|Family Get-together|4|Out of town family member wanted Italian food and I chose Andino's. Food and drinks were good, but service was great, as provided by Lisa!
July 11, 2015|Providence Italian|4|Wait staff informative and willing to please. Interactions of staff among each other -- respectful at all levels--great team work. Huge portions of good tasting food. Good variety (staples) on the menu as well as specials for the evening. chef willing to modify staples and specials to meet your desire. Like most restaurants in the district, parking is an issue so valet parking is a must.
June 18, 2015|Great Italian cuisine|4|Aldino's service and food presentation was impeccable! As with most restaurants on Federal Hill, this restaurant makes you feel like their most important customer. Great food and service!
June 12, 2015|What a Find|5|From the time we pull up to the Valet, we knew we had an exceptional find. Located in Providence it was so much easier to manuver to and from than attempting to go to the Northend of Boston and just we found the area to be just as quaint. We were led thru the bar area to a beautiful outdoor garden area to have a drink while we waited for the rest of our party of six. We were so impressed with the outside dining, we requested a table outside, if possible. We had reserved an inside table about a week before our visit. They were able to accomodate us and we had a delicious Italian dinner. Our Servers, Katrina and Lisa were both professional and lots of fun to chat with. This will be out go to spot in Providence. Great experience all around.
June 10, 2015|Food and hospitality|5|Outstanding Italian food; Staff is great and the atmosphere is very very nice like being in a quaint restaurant in Italy
June 7, 2015|Outside setting gorgeous.|3|"The outside patio setting is gorgeous. Inside the restaurant is small so you are right on top of other diners. I found it especially tight for larger parties (more than 6) if you don't have the round table near the window. Its hard to converse with a party of 7 with a rectangular table. We had a few very good entrees (scampi, chicken saltimbocca, steak) however the Chicken Andino was a disappointment to people in our party. Very bland, we sent it back to add more flavor, they put in garlic and parsley. The calamari was excellent - had a kick to it. Portions are a good size. Wine glasses are also a nice size and they fill the glass, unlike some other neighboring restaurants. I am looking forward to returning on a nice night to sit in the outside patio area to enjoy cocktails and appetizers. The waitress, ""Mama"" was very friendly and accommodating - she has a big personality which we enjoyed!! Valeting our vehicles was easy even though it was a busy Sunday night; the valet guy did a nice job getting people in and out."
June 6, 2015|A Winner in Providence|5|Been dining at Andino's for years. Tremendous food, atmosphere, service, the works. It's an outstanding restaurant and I can't recommend it highly enough.
June 4, 2015|wonderful.|5|Asked for entrée not on menu. They were pleased to make it for me. Everything was excellent. Service impeccable.
June 2, 2015|Wonderful waitress, Eveyone calls her Ma...|5|Wonderful waitress, Eveyone calls her Mama. She made us feel as though we were in her home and she was taking care of us.
May 30, 2015|Authentic Italian.|4|Good wine list and cocktail menu. Food is excellent, I recommend veal piccata - but everything I have had there was good.
May 25, 2015|Good food and location|4|The restaurant had good service and the food was also good. Not the best Italian meal but certainly good enough. Eat outside on their patio if possible. Easy walk from downtown.
May 23, 2015|Can't wait to go back!|5|Food was delicious! We had a great time. Thanks Ernie!
May 20, 2015|Great night out!|4|Our server Laurie was awesome! She was very nice and patient with us, as we had an of array of questions about the drink options and food. Great restaurant on the hill!
May 14, 2015|Fabulous dinner.  The nicest people ever...|5|Fabulous dinner. The nicest people ever took great care of us.
Dined on May 14, 2015|High-quality food at prices that didn't kill us|5|split an entree and an appetizer between two people and it was plenty of food. Delicious. Great service. Good date spot.
May 9, 2015|Feels like Family|5|My husband and I went to Andino's the night before Mothers Day to celebrate. Our children live out of state and I knew I would be sad eating out on Sunday with a bunch of moms and kids. We chose Andinos because I have a gluten allergy and they could accommodate. We had a great table, by ourselves overlooking the street. The other tables were in a room that looked crowded and noisier. Our server was very helpful and told me the chef could make most of the dishes gluten free. The food and wine were very good. At the end of the meal the manager came over and told us that any time I felt sad, I should come to Andinos and be with family!
April 26, 2015|Food is excellent tables too close|4|Food is excellent in this cozy restaurant. The tables are much too close which creates excessive noise. One member of our party was jostled every time a waiter or patron passed through the narrow aisle. Request a table by the window where there's more room.
April 25, 2015|Night out with friends|5|Great classic Italian food, Good service, small place with tight tables but comfortable. Nice night out.
April 24, 2015|Great spot!|5|"This is the second time I have chosen Andino's to bring friends. With so many restaurants in our area, I wanted to be sure I impressed my guests with great food, a variety of menu items, and something different for our drink selection. We weren't disappointed. We chose the red ""Sinatra Sangria"" because of an added ingredient - limoncello. It was delicious, as was all of our dinners. Being Italian myself, I'm a bit picky about the quality and flavor of my food. There was no lack of flavor on our plates! I also love the cozy feel. The portions were generous, and the service was excellent. Being able to use Open Table to make reservations is an added bonus."
April 24, 2015|Excellent , my favorite on the hill. We ...|5|Excellent , my favorite on the hill. We come from ct just to go there .
April 18, 2015|dinner at Andino's|5|Everything about our experience at Andino's was wonderful! Our party of 4 was seated early at our reserved table and the service all evening (Laura) was impeccable! She was informative, attentive, very friendly, and efficient. We ordered fried cheese ravioli and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers and both were delicious. For our meals we had chicken parmesan, veal piccata, chicken marsala, and baked manicotti, all of which were excellent! Somehow we had a tiny bit of room for dessert so we split a homemade tiramisu...it was light and flavorful. I have been raving about this dinner ever since and cannot wait to go back to Andino's when it warms up to sit on the lovely patio!
April 12, 2015|Another Great Meal|5|As this was my 6th time eating at Andino's, again it didn't disappoint. We drive down to Providence 3-4 times a year for different reasons. Mostly sporting events at the Dunk or a performance at PPAC. Although we don't go to Andino's exclusively, it is still our go to eatery. Every time we have eaten there the place is packed but the service and quality is still top notch. The service staff is attentive and friendly and the Host and Hostess are the best. It will serve you well to make a reservation as the wait could be a problem if you are trying to get to a venue at a certain time. The food is Great and plentiful. You will not go home hungry that's for sure. Whether you order from the regular menu or indulge in one of their specials you will be pleased. Keep up the good work Andino's and we'll see you again.
April 5, 2015|Never Disappoints|5|We've been to this restaurant many times and it never disappoints. Consistently great food. Friendly service. Authentic Italian Gem.
March 29, 2015|Great all around|5|From our server Laura to all the food, everything was excellent. We had Shrimp Scampi, Lobster Ravioli, Swordfish Piccata, and Veal Piccata and all enjoyed their food. Only drawback is the seating is tight.
March 28, 2015|Great Chicken Parmesan|5|ESPN announcer John Buccigross recommended for the Chicken Parmesan and it was great. Was in town for the NCAA Frozen Four and it made for great late dinner in Federal Hill.
March 27, 2015|Excellent Waiter|5|Our waiter was Brian. He provided excellent service throughout the night.
March 24, 2015|Business Dinner|5|Great place for a business dinner. Food and service are top notch and prices are reasonable.
March 22, 2015|Delicious food made from scratch. Excell...|5|Delicious food made from scratch. Excellent wine choices
March 16, 2015|Authentic Italian|5|I've come here for two celebrations and been pleased both times. For this meal, we brought a friend who lived in Italy for 10 years, and he enjoyed everything about his meal. The menu is varied, but authentic. The manager is very welcoming and makes you feel glad you've chosen to dine with them. I've had the same waiter both times I've eaten here, and he can be a tad caustic, but perhaps he'd just had a long day. He was efficient, but could use a little polish around the edges. Overall, this is a good choice for dining on Federal Hill.
March 13, 2015|Andino's - a special restaurant|5|Had the veal - best ever. A little noisy but energetic
March 9, 2015|Great spot for lunch or dinner|5|Geat menu with lors of Italian speicialties prepared to order. Service was great and soft Sintra music in background set a good mood and ambiance. Easy valet parking even for weekday lunch.
March 2, 2015|Best gnocchi ever|5|Very nice food, especially gnocchi and eggplant parm. Staff were lovely and very attentive (although to be fair, it probably helped we went there on a Monday night so it wasn't exactly crowded)
February 28, 2015|Andino's on Federal Hill.....Great Italian Food|4|If you are in Providence, Andino's is a must place to eat. Convenient valet parking since self parking can be difficult. Great menu with lots of selections. Price not too expensive. Servers and Waiters are VERY GOOD. Seating can be a bit tight but overall great for dinner and lunch. Having our daughters college graduation dinner at Andino's. Cant wait to come back!
February 26, 2015|Pleasant surprise|4|We had a vendor coming in from Chicago and they were craving some good Italian food from Federal Hill. We've visited the top end restaurants in the past and wanted to try something different. I was told Andino's had great food so we decided to give it a try! At first, I was taken back by how small the space was and the quarters are a bit tight. However once we got past that, everything else fell into place. Our waiter was attentive, the appetizer's were incredible the main course delectable and the drinks spectacular. Best Sangria I've had anywhere! Also don't miss out on the Milky Way Martini, which made the perfect after dinner drink. We didn't have room for dessert but I have no doubt we would have continued to be impressed. What a pleasant surprise!We will ba back!
February 15, 2015|Awesome Service even before I arrived.|5|Made reservations for Andinos for the day after valentine's day a week ahead of time and then we got hit with all the snow. The owner personally called me on phone to infor me of any changes in being open due to snow which I thought was great. When I arrived they had valet service ready even during such harsh conditions and when u walked in they had table ready to go. Kevin was our waiter and attended to our needs quite well. The crab casino appetizers were great and so were our entrees. Valet services were also complimentary that night..I don't know if the always are though. Thanks Anthony,Kevin and all the staff for helping me make an awesome valentine's day.
February 14, 2015|Outstanding food and service|4|Great food and service. Needs to improve ambiance in back or restaurant. Tables too close to each other in restaurant
February 13, 2015|Great time|5|Excellent staff, very attentive. The quaint atmosphere gives it a warm feeling. Stephanie at the bar has an excellent personality and attentive Ernie our waiter was pleasant, detailed, knowledgeable and all around very friendly
February 13, 2015|Good but crowded|4|The food was delicious, although the soup wasn't hot. Adam was a great server, very charismatic and on top of things. The only real issue I had was that the tables were very on top of each other, so it was close quarters. We were there on Valentine's Day weekend, though, so perhaps it's better on a normal night.
February 13, 2015|Second time here, wonderful experience|5|Our second time to Andino's (we are out of towners) and just as thrilled as our first visit. We were fortunate to have Brian as our server again, who is just top notch in every way. Great food meticulously prepared and served, very attentive staff. The stuffed mushrooms are outstanding, by the way.
January 17, 2015|Authentic|4|This restaurant had a lovely feeling to it. The waitress was so great, fun, warm. The food was very nice. They were very helpful for the vegans among us. It was very tight and crowded, so noisy and hard to sit comfortably, but that did not really detract from a good experience there.
January 17, 2015|Always a perfect night out|5|As always the food was spectacular. Service was above expectations & friendly. Never a disappointment In the food or ambiance
January 16, 2015|Excellent service! Love Andino's Restaurant!|4|Our first time at Andino's Restaurant and we were not disappointed! From the time I made a reservation (through open table which I love this site, easier to navigate) through the end of our unforgettable dinner! Just love the place, cozy, delicious food, very satisfied with what we had, me and my husband ordered the special that night, seafood and chicken with pasta, love the portion of the serving, our very good friend selected the best wine and ordered another bottle, Brian our server suggested the best wine. Enjoyed the selection! Excellent food, wine and service! Would highly recommend to our friends and family!
January 10, 2015|Last Minute Choice|4|Brian, our waiter was awesome. He was fun & friendly and always close by with drinks. I ordered something that was not on the menu and the chef had no problem putting it together. The portions are HUGE, and we could not even eat half of our entrees.
January 7, 2015|Very enjoyable|4|Food was excellent, huge portions and good variety. We were pleasantly suprised
January 5, 2015|Great find|4|This restaurant was great!! The good was very good and everyone was so friendly. Try the gnocchi it was delicious!!
January 1, 2015|Impress your out of town guests|5|When it comes to Italian restaurants, Andino's is the place. I recently took several out of towners here and they told me it was the best Italian restaurant they have ever been to. Great food, service, and atmosphere.
December 31, 2014|Staff go above and beyond to see you|5|Staff at your beckon call very notable about menu and wines Waiter Andrew was fun and entertaining
December 24, 2014|Always Good !!!!!|5|the food is always top quality with interesting specials. the portions are big so be careful on the appetizers.. the service is warm and friendly. many of the waiters have been there for years .
December 24, 2014|Great for a family lunch|5|Had a wonderful birthday meal for my mother. Great place for a group lunch. Tables are a little close together but it makes it more home like. Noise level was great for having a toddle with us!
December 23, 2014|Delicious, authentic Italian food at Andino's.|5|Andino's Restaurant serves delicious, authentic Italian food in a small, comfortable space. Excellent service, quality, and overall value. Can't wait to return.
December 19, 2014|Eh|3|I have to say I was a little disappointed with this restaurant. All in all it was a nice experience, but the sauce for the lasagne left something to be desired. Not sure I would be willing to give it another shot.
December 17, 2014|Best on Federal Hill?|5|With so many great choices for Italian dining on Providences Federal Hill it is hard to pick one establishment over another, but Andino's never disappoints. The welcome is invariably friendly, the table is ready, the waiter expert and the food...ah the food....of course it is simply terrific...always!
December 13, 2014|Solid place in food filled area|4|We go here every year around the holidays and have a good experience. Food is good, service is good and the value is good considering the restaurants in the area. Only disappointment was I asked for a menu to take home seeing my fiancé last name is Andino and they said no?? Might not return for this reason
December 13, 2014|Our Favorite Restaurant on the Hill|5|If you appreciate REAL Italian cuisine in a festive, family-style atmosphere, Andino's is the place for you! The food, wine, service is all exceptional. It is a bit crowded, but it adds to the festivity. After lunch, you can take a nice stroll around Federal Hill!
Dined on November 29, 2014|Great Restaurant|5|We celebrated my birthday there and everything was fantastic from every meal to the wonderful service! Brian our waiter was great! We cant wait to go back.
November 28, 2014|Great Experience|5|Everything about our lunch at Andino's the day after Thanksgiving was GREAT! We made an on line reservation for 1pm; window table was ready for us when we walked in. The service (Kendra was our waitress) was perfect: There when we needed anything Great tips (you can get 1/2 calamari and 1/2 smelt for appetizer) Great personality Food was outstanding: my wife had linguini with white clam sauce, I had 3 course special (artichoke dish that was wonderful0 Nice $21 dollar bottle of Pino Noir Entire bill was $65! I have never felt compelled to do a restaurant review before. THIS WAS GREAT!
November 23, 2014|Great Food!|5|The food choices were excellent the prices were fair and the service was very good, only complaint was that it appeared much larger in the pics online. It was rather small and crowded. They had a huge bar area that if there were smart they would expand their dining area because the food is so good. I would recommend but I would suggest then get a larger dining space
November 22, 2014|Disappointed|2|I was disappointed by this restaurant that has been a staple of federal hill for many years. The restaurant was small, noisy and service was particularly slow. Save for a very nice busser who was on top of clearing our table as needed with a smile. The food was sub-par and way overpriced. In a small area with many Italian restaurants competing for business, this restaurant did not win my business back again. I would not suggest this restaurant to friends and would not return.
November 21, 2014|Too noisy, Good dinner.|3|Unfortunately there was a wedding party occupying several tables next to us. The noise level was HIGH & we couldn't even hold a conversation at our table.Server apologized for the noise-so the HIGH is not an exaggeration-but it didn't matter.A free appt or dessert would have helped to make a spoiled evening a little better. Food was good except my eggplant app was a little too crispy on the bottom. Wonder if it was a wedding party app left over? Fried mozz was wonderful. Would definitely visit again IF there isn't a big noisy party next to us.
November 20, 2014|Comfort food|4|Andino's is a consistent experience! The food was good and the staff is always friendly. We sat at the bar(near the door) before dinner and when the door opened we felt the cold air rush in. We were then seated near the door for dinner and felt the cold air again. You need to fix that situation!
November 15, 2014|Gina|5|Andino’s offered a variety of specials from appetizers to dessert. Our meal was filling, but we did find room to fit a fried cannoli for dessert!! The service was great. I will return and would recommend Andino’s to friends and family.
November 14, 2014|Lunch Visit|4|The hot starter with stuffed clams and mushrooms was not very good. The special fish entree' was perfect and will have me returning for more lunches.
November 11, 2014|Amazing night|5|I had an amazing one year anniversary dinner thanks to this restaurant with its wonderful service, and its exceptional food.
November 8, 2014|Lousy|1|"Small, crammed, loud, poor service...not even good gravy for an ""Italian"" place. It took 15 minutes to get a drink order in, another 15 to get food order in and 40+ Minutes to get lobster ravioli and baked stuffed shrimp served (which was horrible). Even the bread was cold and stale. Over $100 tab and I left starving. I'll never be back."
November 8, 2014|best on federal hill|4|the appertizers of shrimp scampi and snail salad were great. In fact, the snail salad was the best i ever had by a long shot. the entree of chicken saltimbocca was excellent, Only problem my entree of veal picatta was very tasty, but the veal was tough. Sometimes this happens at the best restaurants. All in all i will definitely return to this restaurant
November 7, 2014|Andino's restaurant in the federal hill ...|5|Andino's restaurant in the federal hill section of providence is awesome! The food and service were excellent ! There is valet parking which helps when you have reservations. Our table was ready and available as planned. There is much variety with homemade pasta dishes, chicken, seafood, veal, and steak entrees.
November 1, 2014|F Trotta|5|"This is a ""must visit restaurant"" on Federal Hill."" The food is consistently top tier, the staff friendly and is priced fairly."
November 1, 2014|Delicious Food, Loud Music|4|The pasta, eggplant, and bruschetta were delicious! I would have ordered the stuffed mushrooms, but I'm vegetarian. The service was excellent; staff was friendly, accommodating, and polite. The music, however, was too loud. Softer Italian music would definitely create a more appropriate ambiance.
October 25, 2014|loved|5|andino's. have always loved this place and had a the chance to be in providence again and go. a true gem.
October 24, 2014|Good Italian meal, very nice staff|4|The staff was so nice accommodating our growing number of guests. Food very good, nice drinks. Family friendly classic Italian restaurant. Would return again.
October 24, 2014|Great Choice|5|From the vast number of Italian restaurants on Atwells Avenue, we felt like we made the right choice. The bar staff and host were incredibly friendly, introduced themselves, and remembered our names. The food was great--nothing super fancy, just really well prepared, generous portions...and a great tomato sauce. The prices for food and wine were reasonable, and service was excellent.
October 22, 2014|favorite federal hill spot|5|Food is always good,(great red sauce joint) Stephanie behind the bar is the best which is why we're regulars.
October 22, 2014|Great Italian food|4|Excellent Italian food. I try to come here whenever I'm in Providence and the food always lives up to high expectations.
October 21, 2014|Great experience|5|Excellent food and great service for the right price. We enjoy very much the time we spent at this restaurant. They have a very knowledgeable staff. If you like veal this is the place to go. I recommend the Vitello Andino is fantastic. We are definitely going back to repeat the experience.
October 16, 2014|Italian fare|5|"If you are looking for a true Italian restaurant this place on the ""Hill"" is the place to go never disappointing"

Not a problem, they immediately corrected the problem and she had a very enjoyable dinner. Generous portions, we all took a portion home.
October 11, 2014|Incredible|5|Amazing food! Outstanding service! A perfect romantic evening! A great way to start a Waterfire night!
October 8, 2014|Consistent|5|This a great go to ace on the hill. Food is very good, well priced, and consistent. Valet parking is prompt. Best veal parmigiana I have ever had. Other selections always good as well. Waiters and host are terrific. Outside dining in back very quiet and a gem in this urban setting. Our go to place!
September 30, 2014|Amazing|5|I thought I knew what good food was until I came here. Mouth waters when I think about andinos
September 24, 2014|great food, great service|5|We were visiting Providence for a business conference, selected Andino's from on-line reviews. We were delighted with the food and the service. It is located in the Federal Hill neighborhood. We had a group of 12, but we were able to find something on the menu that everyone loved. It was a little cramped, but once some other diners finished their meal, the serving staff added a table to ours and we were able to spread out. The food was fabulous and the service could not have been better. Additionally, we were able to eat for about $50 person including dessert.
September 24, 2014|Great for Authentic RI Italian|5|Came with a group of 6 people. 4 of them were from out of town. We had them try the Snails Andino and the Calamari tosses with the peppers. They loved it. The seafood dishes were extremely fresh and flavorful. Try the chicken or veal parm, best on Federal Hill!!

September 20, 2014|Best veal ever|5|The food is always excellent, with the veal being the best around. Service is always prompt and cordial without being pushy or too chatty, but tonight's dishwasher wasn't up to par. Cracked waterglass, followed by a warm waterglass with a stray piece of lettuce; a far-from-normal occurence (as in never before). The waitstaff was properly horrified and made up for this with a bit of humor and increased attentiveness. Andino's remains my favorite dining establishment
September 20, 2014|Great food and service|5|Worth the two hour drive.Food and service were excellent.Best veal I've eaten in years.
September 20, 2014|Very satisfied|5|Awesome experience, food is always exceptional and generous portions. Ask for Ernie as your waiter!
September 12, 2014|Federal Hill gem!|5|Best veal I have ever eaten...great service..we sat outside which is in the rear
September 6, 2014|anniversary celebration|5|This was our first trip to Andinos but.won't be our last ! Authentic delicious Italian fare with outstanding service!
September 5, 2014|Amazing food|5|Andino's has some of the best Italian food in Rhode Island! If they have the grilled pizzas available, they are amazing, particularly the Italiano. Also, if you like pasta, the gnocchi is the best around... Amazing food! Small intimate location, only negative is it can be loud sometimes, but still very romantic and worth the trip in my opinion!
September 5, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|My husband and I celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary at Andino's with our 17 year old twins. We had a great table on the patio and our waiter Eric could not have been any more nicer or professional that night. He answered our questions about the specials and how they were made and even brought us complimentary glasses of champagne with our appetizers. I wanted to cry. The food was great, I had the eggplant parm, which was a big serving, I took half home! My husband had the chicken saltimbuca (?) and he loved that. My son had the gnocci and my daughter had a chicken dish that was a special, also taking most of it home because the portions are huge at Andino's. It was a perfect night and we cannot wait to dine there again soon!
September 4, 2014|Pluses and minuses.|4|Staff was very nice and attentive. Ambiance was sub-par and interior is long overdue for a remodel, noisy, lighting too bright. Outdoor seating was poorly lit at night and tables need solid tops. Food was very good though, Bravo!!
September 3, 2014|Outstanding evening!|5|Andino's was all I imagined and so much more, service was impeccable, personable and spot on. Never hovering always ready at just the right time.The atmosphere was very nice, we sat outside and couldn't have asked for a more quiet area. (inside looked like it could get noisy if packed).The food was fantastic - from the dipping bread to the meal .Starting w/ fried mozzarella as an app, breaded and topped with the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted.I chose the classic fettuccini,my husband chose the veal parm.Cooked to perfection and plenty left over for. The Limoncello mascarpone cake was great, very lite w/ just enough sweet to seal the deal. They definitely made our anniversary special.... Definitely a must do when on the hill! Enjoy !!
September 1, 2014|Lunch for 6|4|Great spot on Federal Hill. Food is excellent, everything is made to order. Pricey.
August 31, 2014|Great evening|4|Seated right on time, very organized, excellent waitress, delicious!
Dined on August 31, 2014|Visit 2|5|This is my second visit to Andinos food and service awesome
August 31, 2014|Last minute Sunday evening|4|Accommodated reservation for time desired. Appreciated the valet parking as street parking is minimal at best. Food and drinks were fine, large portions where we brought food home. Were pushed a bit to vacate the table as another party was waiting but in all a very good time with a good meal and friends. Price was reasonable.
August 31, 2014|Great food|5|Not my first time here, as always, excellent food, generous portions. Must try the strawberry sangria- very refreshing and not too sweet.
August 29, 2014|always great food|4|As always, the food is great. We booked late so only table was outside on their patio. Prefer inside but is was nice that night. However, the service this night was very slow, 15 minutes to put in a drink order and another 10 to 15 after that to get them. Food was GREAT!! the waitress didn't seem hurried but was missing when repeat drinks were wanted.
August 27, 2014|Federal Hill|5|Andinos was great, food and service was excellent, highly reccommend you visit there, bring your appetite, generous portions.
August 23, 2014|Food was great - I had the veal saltimbo...|5|Food was great - I had the veal saltimbocca. Delicious. Our server Brian was fantastic. Great recommendations.
August 23, 2014|Great food|5|We loved Andinos. The food was excellent!!! The red sangria was great!!!!
August 23, 2014|Excellent quality food and not overprice...|4|Excellent quality food and not overpriced. Had an early reservation (5:45) and the place was packed. The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations. Will definitely go again.
August 16, 2014|Great anniversary celebration|5|Andino's impressed from the beginning with a complimentary round of drinks in celevration of our anniversary. The service and the food was tremendous. I won't hesitate to visit again.
August 12, 2014|A trip to Italy on Federal Hill|5|We had a lovely and delicious dinner at Andinos on Tuesday evening. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgable and the food was delicious. We enjoyed everything and will return when we are next in Providence.
August 9, 2014|One of the best dining experiences|5|Andino's was fabulous! From start to finish, not a single misstep. We were greeted and seated promptly (reservations a must on busy nights). Our waitperson, Ernest--possibly the friendliest server on the planet--made us feel very welcome and was very knowledgeable about the food and libations on the menu and was able to describe them well, with pertinent details. Although I know he had numerous other tables, the level of service was such that it seemed we were his only table. We had two incredible dishes: Chicken Andino's (artichoke hearts, pepperoni, and roasted red peppers in a white wine sauce), and Chicken Saltimbocca, with proscuitto, cheese, and an a-MAZ-ing cream sherry sauce. I almost wept with joy at my first bite of it. 5 stars!
August 1, 2014|rong|4|visiting from Chicago where there is fabulous Italian - Andino's would be welcome on Taylor Street!
July 31, 2014|Great food|5|Attended with a group of 8. Table was ready at specified time and the service was great. Everyone at the table loved their food.
July 31, 2014|Only 5 stars?|5|Everything was 5 stars - and then some! There was no need to even look at the menu - the daily specials fit our needs perfectly. Our server was very helpful and attentive. His personality was sparkling and he had a great sense of humor. His knowledge of both the food offerings as well as the cocktail offerings made our decisions easy!
July 30, 2014|Loved it!|5|This was not our first visit and definitely not our last. Food, service, atmosphere & value are terrific. If you have never been, go! If you have been before, you already know you will go back :)
July 29, 2014|Fantastic!|5|This vintage Federal Hill restaurant is one you simply can't afford to miss. The staff is kind and friendly, our server Laura was also efficient and professional. The food was fresh, not heavy lime some Italian restaurants, hot and delicious. They boast competitive prices that are very reasonable for this area. They have an extensive wine list and menu...I really can't say enough positive things about Andino's, so go see for yourself!
July 26, 2014|Disappointing|2|Although made reservations and was not crowded when got there they wanted to sit us near kitchen. Usual for some restaurants when not regular customer. We asked to move and they put us in window near bar. Food was also disappointing. Had they special zucchini appetizer swimming in Frances's sauce as was the veal francese I ordered. Just lots of butter and lemon. Husband did better with snapper and plain vegetables. Wish we had left and walked up the street but just visiting providence for water fires took this off yelp recommends. If you are from NY where we have excellent Italian, skip this one
July 20, 2014|Good solid Italian food|3|We took our sons to Andino's for lunch on Sunday and they both enjoyed large delicious plates of traditional Italian pasta with red sauce. Perfect for teenagers! Plenty of delicious food and good service.
July 19, 2014|The food outstanding, service great|5|This is one of our favorite restaurants. The service was prompt and courteous. The food is always outstanding. We had the lunch special for Restaurant Week. We also tried an appetizer of Squash Petals that were sauteed with egg and olive oil and seasoned. Excellent! The fried calamari, Rhode Island's State Appetizer, was a little on the spicy side with jalepenos but is was excellent! Main dish was Chicken Andino with artichokes. Great and very flavourful and tender. Highly recommend Andino's for any occassion! I picture the chefs being from the same family and the food tastes like what Grandma would make for us at home. Real comfort food.
July 18, 2014|Unfortunate Experience|1|Always enjoy the food, this visit was no different regarding the quality of food. Service was very lacking, but they were busy. We will never dine here again...we inadvertently left our credit card after checking out, which was fradulently used at a gas station on Benefit St. (in Prov) and a WalMart in Seekonk MA later that evening for over $600. General Manager and owner were extremely unaccomodating when we reached out regarding the incident to alert them of the theft. Very disappointed with the low level of professionalism displayed. Most businesses would want to know when this type of activity was taking place within their walls, apparently Andino's is the rare exception. Will continue to take my business to Camille's and Siena.
July 15, 2014|Good restaurant|5|We went for restaurant week. The good and service was excellent. A lot of old people but it was a Tuesday. If I had to say anything negative the place was small and loud but the food and service make up for it
July 13, 2014|A must to eat at|5|Andino's is the top restaurant on Federal Hill to eat. The wait staff is friendly and the food great. Must try the Peach Sangria. This is the place I go to anytime I visit Providence !!
July 12, 2014|Fantastic experience|5|The food was 10/10. Friendly service. Quick service despite the busy nature of the restaurant on a Saturday night. The location seemed cramped inside but had a beautiful outdoor patio which would be great for the summer.
July 12, 2014|Lovely meal|4|"The menu was typically Italian-American with all the saltimboccas, piccatas, etc., but I was very pleased with my ""special"" appetizer of stuffed zucchini blossoms with ricotta and prosciutto and a wonderful tangy lemony sauce, and a tasty Francese egg batter. Fresh oysters on the half shell also didn't disappoint. My fiancé got a stuffed portobella mushroom and asked for crab stuffing. That was not as good, as any crab was lost in a very moist and smooth bread-y filling and slathered in so much sauce that it was falling apart and not very appetizing. My lobster ravioli was very good, plumply filled and with good lobster taste. Overall we enjoyed it on a nice summer day, sitting near the front window."
July 10, 2014|Late dinner|3|Our restaurant week dinner was a late night reservation so we wouldn't be pushed out. Angel was our server and apologized for getting to us so slowly. She was awesome for our party and made the night. Our food was good to fair but not as good as it usually is. Perhaps it was because of it being restaurant week and the kitchen was over worked. We'll try again as it is usually our go-to on Federal Hill.
July 8, 2014|Tasty but loud|4|The dining room is small, and there was a very large, loud party at the next table. I could barely hear our waiter when he spoke to us. However, the food was tasty.
July 8, 2014|Good Place|4|I recommend this restaurant 4 out 5 meals were great!!!
July 7, 2014|Food for Everyone|5|The menu at this restaurant is endless; nothing to want for. The service was superb, as was the food and portion size. If you get there before 5 PM they offer $1 shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, and I believe oysters. The mushrooms were terrific! They were having a Sangria tasting on their outdoor back patio area that day. It's very cute with plenty of tables, and they offered small appetizers all for $5. We live in MA and will certainly be back!
July 7, 2014|Providence Restaurant week|5|We went during the week that Providence has the special 3-course meals for a set price. We went for lunch and it was fantastic. Nice soup to start, the calamari app is unbelievable and the choices for main meal were great - we all tried different - chicken parm, clams and linguini and Chicken Andino - all were very good.
July 6, 2014|Fantastic Italian Restaurant!|5|Federal Hill gem! Wonderful meal and exceptional service. Ask for Mama!
July 5, 2014|So fresh!|5|We were seated immediately even though we were a few minutes late for our reservation because of parking issues. There was no on street parking when we got there, but paid $15 for valet parking. We were approached by 4 different staff to wish us a happy anniversary, including the manager, who sent free champagne to our table. Brian was our waiter and I don't think I've ever had a better waiter! He was funny, knowledgeable, and attentive without being overbearing. started with the fried calamari - excellent choice. Spicy and fresh. scrod andino - biggest and freshest piece of scrod I've ever had. I thought the pepperoni on top would be strange but it was awesome. Sauce was excellent and wish I had brought home a bottle. No room for dessert.
July 4, 2014|Oldie But Goodie|5|We had a wonderful night over July 4 weekend. We arrived over an hour early, and the staff made us comfortable at the bar and got us in earlier once a table opened. The food was very tasty, and seemed as fresh as any newcomer on the block. The scene is classic but not stale. The place is small but vibrant. I heartily recommend Andino's.
July 3, 2014|Conversation optional|3|I went here for lunch with my 84 year old aunt and uncle, my 75 year old mom and 81 year old dad. The tables are extremely close together - so much so that it is difficult to get into your seat without disturbing the next table. Large folks would surely have trouble. The food was very heavy handed and the menu was boring. The others all enjoyed their meals and the prices were very reasonable. The highlight was our server, who, even at 7 months pregnant, was cheerful, professional and patient with the older folks who had difficulty hearing. I do not recommend this place for foodies. For those who like old fashioned Italian food, it would be ok. Note: there are stairs leading to the men's room which my party had difficulty with.
June 24, 2014|Great food !! HUGE portions|5|Portion sizes are enough to feed 2-3 people! I've never seen Chicken Parm so big! Food is SO great; authentic for sure. Tables are tight. Would return in a heartbeat!
June 22, 2014|Terrible.|1|The food was absolutely terrible. We had a great waiter but the food was so incredibly bad it didn't even matter. We will never be returning nor will we recommend it to anyone.
June 19, 2014|Andino's|5|Quality of food excellent, delicious, as was the attentiveness of the waiter. One item I had enjoyed in the past was no longer on the menu, but the chef prepared it for me anyhow.
June 11, 2014|Yes to Andino's!|5|Andino's is absolutely delicious! Whenever I have an excuse to get down to Providence I make sure to dine at Andino's. I live near Boston and none of the North End restaurants I've been to has a dish as good as Andino's gnocchi. The gnocchi itself is cooked perfectly and the pink vodka sauce is mouth watering. The waitstaff has always been very helpful in their recommendations.
June 7, 2014|outstanding|5|Dining here for years. Never dined outside before but did this time and it was wonderful. One of my favoirtes on Federal Hill
June 7, 2014|Never Disappoints|5|Great neighborhood restaurant. The food is fabulous. There is an extensive menu and no matter what I have ordered, it has always been good. This time we ordered a watermelon sangria which was delightful as an accompaniment to our eggplant parm and meatball and ziti entrees. The bread is always fresh and delicious and the staff is always friendly. Even though Federal Hill boasts great restaurants, I am always tempted to return to Andino's.
June 3, 2014|Excellent exerience all around!|5|I selected this location for a group of work colleagues for a dinner during a training session. The selection couldn't have been better! We had the most unbelievable waitress that made the evening memorable, pleasant, fun, and entertaining! She was attentive, fun, happy to be there, and knowledgeable. She made recommendations that we SPOT ON for all 8 of us, and treated us like we were part of her family. The food was OUTSTANDING! All 8 of us were thrilled with our selections, in fact, we were all raving about each of our meals at dinner. I highly recommend this spot - sit outside and request Laurie, tell her the crazy crew that nicknamed her Gina sent you! :)

May 22, 2014|Best of Federal Hill|4|Andino's is good basic Italian coupled with great cocktails, knowledgeable wait staff, and all the little touches that make dining more than eating out. Our swordfish with grilled artichoke in a white wine sauce was fabulous perhaps the best preparation of swordfish I have ever eaten. The Caesar salad was huge and thankfully shared and even the bread was special. Our pre dinner soups were loaded with vegetables and in my case chicken and were served very hot. We had no room left for dessert but the ones we saw made us want to indulge.
May 18, 2014|Good, but not great|3|Steak was nice and cooked beautifully to order. Chicken was tender. Spinach was over-garlicky. Wine was delicious, a simple red cab by the glass. Portions were manly. I'd go back, it's a fun spot, with reliable cuisine.
May 17, 2014|Very enjoyable|5|I very much enjoyed my night out at Andino's. We found this place through Open Table and it did not disappoint!
May 15, 2014|Pre Show Meal|5|Andino's is simply a fun place to eat. From the Host to the waitstaff it is always enjoyable. The food is outstanding and plentiful. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Providence. They treat you like family and if your in a rush they can get you out of there quickly but they certainly don't rush you if you're not in a hurry.
May 11, 2014|Tops on the Hill|5|Always a star selection on Federal Hill in Prov Superb portions of quality food with great personal extra service
May 10, 2014|Excellent experience|5|We were very impressed with the service at Andino's. Our server was great. The drinks and meals were delicious - lobster ravioli and veal saltimbocca. It was a quick walk from PPAC. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Providence.
May 5, 2014|Midweek treat|4|Dined on a Tuesday evening with colleagues, our first time visit. Service was quick and accomdating. Food delivered hot , portions large. My group is a party group. We will attend again
May 4, 2014|Just OK|3|Went here for a b-day dinner. Service was great. We were seated promptly and the wait staff was friendly and accomodating. It smells devine so I was really looking forward to the meal. Sadly, my steak was just OK. Tasteless and tough. Others enjoyed their meals so maybe I just made a bad choice. With so many other options to pick from on Federal Hill, think we will skip this one next time.
May 3, 2014|Excellent, classic food!|5|Andino's has superb, classic dishes, cooked perfectly. Great family atmosphere, great location. Chicken parmigiana, garlic bread, pasta were some of the best we've ever had.
May 3, 2014|Terrific waitress|5|This was our first visit and it was a group if 10. It was only 5 o'clock but the place was lively with good energy. Everyone enjoyed their meal, portions were generous and delicious. Our waitress was the best.
April 27, 2014|Our First Visit|5|"Sunday was our first time at Andino's Restaurant and it was wonderful. I made reservations, we were seated right on time. The staff and waiters were friendly and efficient, the food absolutely delicious. We usually eat at the ""restaurant next door"", but they were closed, and I am happy that they were because we found our new favorite eating place on Federal Hill! I recommend it to anyone and everyone and we will be dining there again soon!"
April 26, 2014|ALWAYS Delicious!|5|Our meal was perfect as always! Don't miss the polenta with pepperoni sauce appetizer when they're offering it - it is insane! Calamari is always perfect. Tonight's special: double thick veal chops saltimbocca. Smothered in a thick layer of mozzarella cheese with a layer of prociutto beneath, with mushrooms in a perfect marsala sauce... The veal was like butter...so delicious... We always ask for Eric for our server - love his extra care :)
April 18, 2014|Excellent service|5|Complimentary Valet was a great bonus. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive with lots of support staff. Food was good and reasonably priced. Making reservation on line was easy and they were ready for us when we got there.
April 16, 2014|Good food!|3|If good food is all you need than Andino's great! Space is very small, very cramped, very dated, but service is good and good is great!
April 11, 2014|Great Food|5|My wife and I loved the quiet table near the window. We had every intentions of having dessert, but the portions of food are so big there was never a chance of dessert. Very attetive wait staff
April 5, 2014|Top 5 of Providence|5|I have been to Andino's three times over the past 2 years while visiting Providence. The staff is warm and inviting but the food is just amazing. My personal favorites are the Veal Parm with a Calamari appetizer. And the wine list is top shelf and affordable. There are over 2 dozen restaurants on Federal Hill and only 2 that are I consider true Italian fare. Andino's is my number 1. I shall return.
April 2, 2014|Food was great,,service was|5|Food was great,,service was great,,down side when dining with only 2 people you are off to the side. Our table was near the busy kitchen.
March 29, 2014|Simply the best|5|Consistent is the word. No matter when you go food is excellent. Love this place
March 24, 2014|Thank You!|5|The restaurant is a favorite of ours. Chose this evening for a birthday dinner for my wife and it couldn't have been better. All my special requests were acted on to make the dinner and evening perfect. The service (Erik) and the staff and management were outstanding- friendly, attentive, and welcoming. Thank you!
March 23, 2014|DELISH|5|It was my first time at Andinos and I thought the food was absolutely delisious and the service and ambience was wonderful! It made me feel like I was in an authentic Italian restaurant with the music and everything, it's a cute place.
March 23, 2014|Great Italian!|5|My family and I go to Andino's every once in a while for lunch… I have two young kids and it's just fancy enough to make me feel as if I'm out for a special treat, yet user-friendly enough to make me comfortable bringing my kids. Valet is a plus on The Hill, and the staff is always very professional and friendly. The food is WONDERFUL. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking into having a great Italian meal.
March 22, 2014|Excellent|5|First time at Andino's very good food and prices as well. Little disappointed they had ran out of canollies too early. Service was excellent, would definitely go back. Its a small place a little crowded but well worth going.
March 21, 2014|Excellent Food, Excellent service!!|5|We were a group of 6 and we felt like they were available whenever we needed. great food and we had a great experience!! We will be back
March 15, 2014|Great food|4|We had a Saturday night reservation, and the table was fully ready for our arrival. The food is superb, and the portions are ginormous: be prepared to ask for a to-go box! The menu is long with tons of options. I do recommend the five cheese ravioli; the pieces are probably the largest you'll have ever seen, and they're heavenly. As the evening progressed we watched many people being turned away for not having reservations on a very busy weekend night with several large groups dining at the restaurant.
March 15, 2014|Wonderful dining experience|5|This place is great for the authentic Italian food experience of Federal Hill. My husband's favorite place to go. We always spend our special occasions here. This week was my husband' s birthday and he was happy to have spent it at Andino's!
March 11, 2014|A Re-disovered Gem|5|It may have been at least a decade since I dined at Andino's due to changing patterns of client locations. I should have known when my client suggested Andino's and the other party joining us said he couldn't wait, that I was in for a treat. When I walked in the door the smells of delicious food brought all the memories back. We were only there for lunch but Andino's make lunch an adventure with a 3 course, $14.95 lunch special that all of ready to order in a flash. The choices in each category was impossible to make, the service was prompt and the food INCREDIBLE! Starting with the soup..out of this world! The artichokes...out of this world! And the feel with a side of pasta with red sause...out of this universe!! Dinner soon!!
March 8, 2014|Andino's is a hidden Gem in|5|Andino's is a hidden Gem in Providence. The food is outstanding. Food was hot and delicious! Prices were excellent for the quality of food.
March 7, 2014|Food and wait staff was excellent.|5|Food and wait staff was excellent. Cheerful, friendly team of people was attentive and extremely helpful. Brian our waiter was great. I came in the five kids prior to the Providence Bruin game and this person got everything we needed and asked for quickly and courteously. I would come back again without hesitation. The food was fantastic!!!!!
March 4, 2014|This is the place to go when|4|This is the place to go when you want to eat Italian like you did in your grandmothers kitchen.
March 1, 2014|amazing sevice and food|5|My boyfriend and I LOVE Andino's. We come for special occasions and are never disappointed!
March 1, 2014|Relaxing lunch experience.|4|Quaint little restaurant with plenty of class. Very good food, super service and great wine list. I was thrilled to find my favorite wine that I had while vacationing in Italy. Would definitely go back.
February 28, 2014|Very happy with our experience|5|Our server, Eric, was friendly and attentive. The entire staff worked together to ensure we had everything we needed or wanted. Not once did I have an empty glass of water in front of me. Service was impeccable. Will definitely go back.
February 28, 2014|Food ok, but service over attentive|2|Food was okay, but service was so attentive we felt that they wanted us to leave. we were out in over an hour.
February 24, 2014|Great food|4|Food was amazing as always. Drinks seemed to be pricy for the size. But I would go back just will think twice about having drinks as they were half the bill and we only had 4 total. The food makes up for it as everything is made to order.
February 23, 2014|Sunday lunch|5|Once again the staff at Andino's has exceeded expectations and made lunch here more enjoyable than any restaurant in providence. I came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and we were seated at the table we went to on our first date here along with rose petals under the glass of the table. Our waitress gave us an amazing tip on a new wine to try, which was fairly priced and amazing! Our server and the manager were especially attentive to us and made us feel like we were the only ones in the place. Highly recommend for just a night on the town or a special romantic meal.
February 22, 2014|Delicious!|4|We had a very satisfying lunch at Andino's restaurant. They had a 3 course fixed priced lunch special for $18.00 which we took advantage of, and we were not disappointed!
February 21, 2014|Birthday Celebration|5|The service was outstanding. Our waiter was funny, polite and very attentive. The food was outstanding. Very flavorful. We went for a birthday celebration and we had so much fun laughing, eating and enjoying the ambiance.
Dined on February 19, 2014|Great night out|4|Both my wife and I were visiting providence for the 1st time and this restaurant was a recommendation. Hats off to the staff and chief. Great food and wine. Tables are very close or to say it on top of each other, small but delightful food and drink. Will return with our next visit.
February 17, 2014|Buono Apetito|4|The food was good. Tables tight but I remember they always are. One meal did come out 3-4 minutes after the others. No apology given. That 3-4 minutes is awkward because those that got their food are like afraid to start eating and the other person insists they do. Overall I would return again...
February 16, 2014|Great food & Atmosphere|5|Great food and atmosphere. Service was wonderful. Too much noise though which takes away from the atmosphere. Overall a romantic, friendly place for dinner. Prices good too.
February 16, 2014|Awesome|5|Great food and service. Corey did a wonderful job. It was a busy Sunday night but the food was very good. My date's food was good too. I can't wait to go back.
February 16, 2014|Great place|4|My boyfriend and I went here for the first time, and although there were many non-couples there, the ambiance was very romantic and was perfect for a date. We both got gnoccis in pink voldka sauce which were delicious. Our only complaints were the tight seating, which is unavoidable in such a small place on Federal Hill, and that the service was pleasant but very slow.
February 14, 2014|FOOD IS OUTSTANDING ( BUT)|3|I know valentines day is very busy. I reserved a table two weeks prior to valentines day. Asked for a specific table and got two calls confirming the table was all set. However when we arrived 15 minutes early we noticed that a couple was at that table and was just sitting down. When we asked why the manager told the waitress to tell us that there had been a problem with that table and was sorry. Ok table is not a big deal I understand but the problem is we said we would wait without a problem and they said we would impede on the next reservations for that table. Worst part is we got stuck in a corner JAMMED in.
February 14, 2014|awesome|5|Andinos never fails to impress me! The restaurant has been closed for renovations for some time and man was it worth the wait. Their recipes really give it that home made feel as well. Even though we were there on Valentines day and it was busy it was a great experience and we weren't rushed or anything.
February 14, 2014|"outstanding food and service
as"|5|outstanding food and service as always. Never disappoints.
February 14, 2014|It's too bad|1|We were super excited to try this restaurant. Unfortunately it fell short and was less than mediocre at best. I ordered the pink vodka sauce penne (typically my favorite) and it tasted like italian gravy mixed with pink something...it was awful. The service was good, but the restaurant packed people in like sardines for valentines day. We could not move as well as the waiters.
February 14, 2014|Always an excellent meal!|5|Andino's never disappoints! Great food, great service and Federal Hill charm. Highly recommend
February 8, 2014|A great place to dine|5|Great service, great food and they actually honor reservations!
February 8, 2014|We came from out of state|5|We came from out of state and it was worth the drive
February 7, 2014|Andino's - Great place!|5|We went to Andino's to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday. We had made reservations which was very nice since they were so busy. The atmosphere was what you would expect of an old-fashioned Italian restaurant. Lots of people talking and laughing. The food was wonderful and the service excellent. I think the owner came by and asked how everything was which is a nice touch.
January 12, 2014|Amazing!|3|At first glance Andinos is quite small and was very busy for a Sunday night. Upon receiving our food we realized why they were so busy. I had the lobster ravioli and it was spectacular. I work in the hospitality industry and I am well aware that a meal that good is rare. Our server seemed a little busy yet he still took excellent care of us. I will definitely be back.
January 12, 2014|The food was fantastic and|5|The food was fantastic and Laura/Mama our waitress was the best. We will be going back for both the food and Mama's service. Excellent service by all.
January 11, 2014|Restaurant Hopper|5|Service is great food is outstanding this is a restaurant that shall be recommended.
January 10, 2014|Great Italian Food, Fun Atmosphere|5|We had a large party (again) at the restaurant and they handled us very well. The atmosphere is always fun, energetic, not too loud, but not like a library either. The place is very enjoyable. And the food is nothing less than fantastic. Try the Chicken Saltimboca - I loved it and everyone at my table tried mine and loved it too. The place is simply awesome. Our waitress, Sabrina, was very good and attentive to all of our needs, and our waiter from last time, Brian, remembered us and offered some tips and answered some questions. All in all just a great place.
January 8, 2014|Dinner and a show|5|Had an early dinner before seeing a play at P PAC.... Food was excellent though the salad was fair... Service was outstanding ... Wine list could use some work but not a deal breaker... No question I would eat here again!
January 4, 2014|Delicious dinners!|5|Our meals were delicious. The white sangria was excellent as was the lemoncello cake. My husband was able to enjoy his meal three times as his portion was so generous.I would highly recommend Andino's. Also our servers were highly attentive.
December 31, 2013|Lively evening|5|Andino's never disappoints. Wonderful meal, attentive staff and enjoyable evening. Veal Andino was wonderful and drinks were tasty.
December 31, 2013|Sadly dissappointed|3|We were seated at our table and after a good 5 minutes had to ask if we had a server no one came to the table. We were told the specials and were charged 28 for an appetizer for two think they should have mentioned the prices on the apps. We both had veal parm for dinner that was the positive of the entire meal it was relish!
December 31, 2013|Loved this place!|5|I have never been to Providence before, and picked my restaurant just on reviews. We ate here on NY Eve, and I picked an early dinner time on purpose to avoid the craziness. They sat us the instant we walked in, and we were impressed from then on. The calamari was fried perfectly, light and crunchy, portion was huge. My husband gets chicken parm everywhere, and said this was one of the best. My Veal Saltimbocca was probably the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, I could cut the veal with my fork it was so tender. There were so many varieties of sangria that I had a tough time deciding on the Sinatra version that I had, and will have again. I would consider driving the hour and a half again just to get dinner there.
December 24, 2013|Christmas Dinner|5|Wow! That's all I can say. Baccala salad, stuffed Scrod, calamari. Wow. Not one leftover on MY table! Great waitstaff too, REAL GOOD drinks. I'll be back!
December 24, 2013|Just a great place to dine.|5|Just a great place to dine. Everybody on the staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you happy..
December 22, 2013|Italian|4|Lobster ravioli was excellent as was the eggplant parm my mother had. My mom even asked how they prepared the eggplant parm so she could try it at home. The place was a little on the noiser side the night we went, but Italian restraunts are about food and family so not unexpected. Prices were reasonable considering quality of food.
December 21, 2013|Ok food fantastic service|3|Service was great. It could be because it was Saturday and they wanted to move tables but, they kept things moving but, I did not feel rushed. Food was marginal. Fettuccine Alfredo was a hit but, other items we had were weak. I could eat their again without complaint and find something because of the expansive menu but, at the same time I would not expect anything to be special. Price wise very reasonable and expansive menu.
December 21, 2013|Best on Atwells Ave|5|Consistently great food each and every time, which is hard to say for Andino's competitors on Atwells Ave (ie: Cassarino's next door is notorious for skimping on product and serving up bad plates). Always great service to boot.
December 13, 2013|Family Gathering|5|"We choose Andino's as a family gathering spot to celebrate my sister's birthday who is from Vevada and traveling through Providence.(we are from Massachusetts) Everybody raved about the entire experience! ""The server was fantastic, the appetizers were so good, my meal was outstanding, what a great spot!"""
December 11, 2013|Not my favorite|2|I had the chicken Cacciatore which was only fair. Instead of pieces of chicken it was a breast which was butterflied and dry. My husband had the Veal Andimo which he thought had good flavor, but the pasta was not drained enough and was over cooked. Appetizers were only so so, we had the Arancini which were huge yet lacked flavor, fried Ravioli which did not seem home made and the Calimari which was very good. All in all not my favorite place.
December 6, 2013|My favorite federal hill restaurant|5|Andino's is my favorite place for Italian food in Providence. Came for an early dinner with my sister and we were in and out in 45 minutes. Great service, and the food was excellent as always.
November 23, 2013|shrimp far diavlo too spicy|3|shrimp far diavlo too spicy to eat. two of us got the same special drink, one was all alcohol with no juice/mix.
November 23, 2013|An Italian Diamond in the Rough|4|Andino's is probably one of Federal Hill's best kept secrets! It may not look as fancy from the outside as some of the other restaurants on the hill, but the food is amazing and the prices are terrific!
November 22, 2013|First Class Dining!!!|5|We love it here. The wait staff are the best. Nothing negative to say about this wonderful restaurant.
November 22, 2013|First visit|5|This was my first visit to this restaurant. The food was great and the waitress was knowledgeable and very friendly. And the sangria ..... outstanding!!!!!!!! We will be back soon.
November 16, 2013|wonderful|5|Great food great service. A bit snug as far as seating
November 14, 2013|Italian Dinner|4|Wonderful little Gem, we've been here several times,each time the food has been a delight. Huge portions , we always bring leftovers home.
November 9, 2013|Great food, serrver and environment|5|We were fortunate to have Brian as our server, tremendously personable and capable and with a memory for the specials like you read about. The food was outstanding and obviously prepared with care. The atmosphere is authentic. All timing good, great place, will heading there again on regular Providence visits.
November 9, 2013|Bums Rush|2|Went on Open Table and made reservation but only could get mid afternoon reservation only to find out that they had a large party coming in and i had an hour to rush my food down. Please take time into consideration for cooking. After 45 mins they began to put the rush and push to get out as they had a large party of people to set up for. Tables were cramped on top of one another and you could barely move. Ate there many times before a few years back but it has changed vastly. W 4 of us left and walked around only to find they didn't need out table after all. WIll never go back again. Too many other better restaurants on Federal Hill to choose from with a much better wine list as theirs is very poor.
November 7, 2013|Italian delight|4|"True Italian cooking. The ""rice ball"" appetizer was amazing. the pasta excellent.The staff was most helpful and attentive. The valet parking was most appreciated as parking in this neighborhood is difficult."
November 3, 2013|nice friendly italian restaurant|4|We were looking for a place to have dinner in Providence, after seeing a play in Woonsocket. Went to Andino's based on other reviewer comments we read. The food was well prepared, and the service was excellent. It is a small restaurant, so reservations are a must. They have free valet parking, which is a real bonus in downtown Providence (the valet saw us rise from our table to leave, and got our car before we even left the front door). The only downside for us was that we were seated at a single table in the bar area, by the front window, and being a fall evening, the location was a bit cold as it was near the entranceway of the restaurant. We will go back again, as the food was a great value, including a nice bottle of wine.
Dined on November 2, 2013|Delicious Federal Hill restaurant|4|Our first dining experience on Federal Hill was a winner. Took our college student son put with the family and were happy to have our reservation honored on time and get courteous service and delicious food. Everything we ordered was very well prepared.
November 1, 2013|Favorite Federal Hill Restaurant|5|Our waiter Matt, was great and explained all of the ingredients in all of the specials and menu items and was great giving suggestions. The meal was fit for our visit and we got a bonus lunch with our take home food for the next day. We had 7PM reservations and were sat at our table as soon as we walked in.
October 30, 2013|I made reservations to celebrate|5|I made reservations to celebrate a birthday. We called because we were running late and the server was so nice and friendly. The food was amazing. We had apple cider sangria that was so delicious. All around amazing experience! We were the last table there but never felt rushed or like we were a bother...!!! We will definitely return!!!
October 29, 2013|The food and service was outstandin|5|The food and service was outstanding. I would definitely go back.
October 28, 2013|Awesome|5|The restaurant was awesome and so was our waitress Sabrina
October 28, 2013|Anidno's was good. Not bad|3|Anidno's was good. Not bad and not great. Just good.
October 27, 2013|"Another ""hill"" gem"|4|Andino's is a great place to have a terrific Italian meal. The service was very good along with the food. I would say it's small and tables are quite close together, so the noise level can get a bit high, but that shouldn't prevent you from going and enjoying!!
October 26, 2013|our favorite restuarant!!|5|as always, Andino's restaurant was great! we celebrated both my and my husbands birthdays and our 30th wedding anniversary!! the staff made us feel welcome and offered us delicious desserts to commemorate these special occasions!! the food was spectacular as usual!! we travel an hour from Connecticut to dine here.. our favorite Italian restaurant by far!! we compare all other Italian eateries to Andino's.. and Andino's always wins!! would recommend this place to anyone who wanted great Italian food... a special thanks to MJ, our server, who was especially sweet to us..
October 25, 2013|Highly recommended|4|Went with a party of 8 on a Friday night. Valet parking was great. The restaurant was full. Our table was waiting for us. Limited floor space so the tables tend to be a little crowded together. Our waitress, MJ, was great and very helpful. She made several good suggestions. Several people in the party shared dishes. No problem. Food was great. Service was outstanding. Looking forward to returning.
October 20, 2013|Nice Italian place - fine service|4|I booked a table for 8 early on a Sunday evening. Our table was ready when we arrived, despite the restaurant being suprisingly full at that hour. Service was excellent throughout - the waiter was clearly experienced in handling such a crowd. The food itself was OK - I've had many more memorable Italian meals in Manhattan. The calimari was excellent, while the veal offerings were fair. Portions were generous throughout, and prices were reasonable. I would have welcomed some more recommendations concerning house specialties - every menu item seemed to have a 'special' Andino sauce, but none that we ordered seemed all that special. I look forward to a return visit with fewer guests and more time to explore what Andino's has to offer.
October 19, 2013|Great Place|5|Food was excellent and portions large. Big selection of Italian dinner items so everyone could find something to order. Nice wine list. Small neighborhood restaurant, so it fills up quickly. Making a reservation through Open Table was the only way we could have eaten there. Waiter was very friendly and the service was timely. We had a table in the front of the restaurant by the front window and bar area which was a mixed bag. Being able to look out the window on the busy street was entertaining, but the noise and crowd of people packing into the foyer/bar area hoping to get a table made our area quite loud and very cramped. The valet parking is included when you eat at Andino's, so make sure you use the valet. Parking is impossible.
October 19, 2013|Experience|3|I was very disappointed with the lack of personality with our server. The hostesses were nice but a bit pushy when it came to cleaning off our table for another reservation and pushing us to finish. I have been to Andinos multiple times before and never had a problem but was very disappointed and probably will not return
October 17, 2013|nice place for groups|4|Group of six very good service nice wine recommendations.
October 14, 2013|our anniversary dinner|5|Everything was amazing. We had the table by front window for two, waiter was the nicest guy ever. Wished us happy anniversary and his suggestions were perfect. He even treated us to a special dessert. Amazing night with my wife
October 13, 2013|Andino's Always Comes Through|5|The food, the service and atmosphere are consistently great at Andino's. This is my go to favorite on Federal Hill, they serve macaroni and red gravy like I remember from my childhood and always offer a variety of Italian specialties that never disappoint.
October 13, 2013|Alway Satisfied!|5|Went to Federal Hill for Columbus Day parade and decided to have family Sunday dinner there and we were fortunate to have gotten a reservation on Open Table (of course) at the last minute. We arrived within 10 minutes of making the reservation on my phone and greeted by the host with a warm welcome as if he knew me! Although we have dined there a couple of times, I still can't remember his name but he is always friendly. There were 6 of us and we all had a fabulous meal! Although not on the menu, I asked Sabrina our waitress if she would ask the chef to make me shrimp sergio, an amazing appetizer that you absolutely have to try! Sabrina was attentive and did a great job!
October 10, 2013|Great birthday dinner|5|We celebrated my wife's birthday dinner at this restaurant. My wife, my three kids, and I all had a fantastic time. The food was great, the service was great and the waitress got the entire restaurant to sing happy birthday to my wife
October 9, 2013|review jaime|5|excellent a little cramped for 4 guys (clients) but excellent nfood service location
October 6, 2013|Terrific restaurant|5|This place was a gem. The service was excellent and the food even better. I strongly recommend the Veal Parmesan stuffed with eggplant...outstanding. I took my wife for our anniversary and the restaurant comped us a couple of drinks and put us at a great table by the front. Providence is know for great dining and Andino's certainly lived up to the reputation.
October 5, 2013|Good food, tight space.|3|Food is good family fare on Federal Hill. Small table for six people.
October 3, 2013|Always a great time and fabulous|5|Always a great time and fabulous food. One of the best places on Federal Hill in Providence Rhode Island to dine at.
September 28, 2013|Disappointing|1|"We arrived early but were seated immediately. Our waiter was slow in taking all of our orders. Everything took forever to be brought to us. He brought my iced tea but never the sweetener I asked for. Our appetizer finally arrived and was delicious. He took the plates away, saying the food would be right out. Right out=at least 20 more minutes. By the time the food arrived, we had been at the table over an hour. An hour! We were missing River Fire for this, and I needed to be in bed early for the race the next morning! The food came out, and my ""Special"" Veal, that cost $35, was BURNED! It was hard to cut, as well, The pasta was okay, but nothing special. Our bill was almost $100, and the food was horrible! What a disappointment!"
September 22, 2013|Andino's|5|Gret place for a great family meal - Sangria is the Best in Provi!
September 20, 2013|Mixed reviews..|4|We just recently moved to Rhode Island and weren't too sure where to go for dinner, so thanks to open table mobile app we found this spot, Andino's. Definitely make reservations, it's small inside but does have patio seating in the back, Friday night on Federal Hill is very lively and so was this restaurant. The noise level was moderate, the service was pretty good despite the wait of about 45 minutes to an hour for our entrees but once we finally got our meals it was worth the wait! The portions are big and very filling, you will leave with a take home. I'd def recommended this place and will go again, just be prepared for the wait but it's worth it.
September 18, 2013|Fantastic service/memorable evening|5|"This evening was fantastic, Wednesday night and it was great to see the energy. The service was perfect, very helpful getting us the right table, very attentive, and enjoyable. The food was sensational, and I enjoyed my swordfish while family members raved about the pasta/chicken dishes, and another remarked ""Best Steak ever"". The evening was to celebrate a special family occasion. Barely had room for dessert, but had a nice surprise Birthday dessert served to table which was delicious. The staff couldn't have made our evening more memorable. We will definitely go again and highly recommend Andino's for a lovely night out."
September 16, 2013|great service|5|This was the first time dining at a restaurant on federal hill so I wasn't sure what to expect. We chose Andino's after reading the reviews on OpenTable and was pleasantly surprised they were accurate. We walked in and were immediately treated like we were regulars. The chicken parm and Lemoncello cake were phenomenal. The portions were large and delicious, beverage selection intriguing, and prices fair. I highly recommend Andino's for any occasion.
September 15, 2013|Night on the Hill|5|Have eaten at many Italian restaurants in New England. Andinos rates as one of the better dining experiences. I look at the quality of food verses ambiance. Both myself and dining partner found every aspect of the meal to be excellent. A plus was the service by the wait staff attending to all aspects from start to finish.
September 8, 2013|Awesome|5|Andino's is a hidden gem. Their patio is behind the restaurant, hidden away. The service was fabulous, Ernie was so entertaining. The seafood stuffed portabella mushroom was incredible, big enough to share but so delicious I didn't want to. The veal parmasean was also good. Large helpings, thus a lot of doggie bags. The fried cannoli was also incredible, another dish that was sharable but I wish I could have eaten it all by myself. Four us ate dinner with dessert, we were not rushed and we made it to PPAC with time to spare.
September 5, 2013|We went for lunch after searching|5|We went for lunch after searching open table reviews for Federal Hill and we were not disappointed!! Andino's received great reviews and we know why, the food is outstanding, just like my mom used to make! The 3 course lunch menu features home made chicken soup, fried raviolis and the best veal marsala I've had in a long time. Our waitress Theresa had great suggestions. The roasted chicken on broccoli rabe and peppers, a special, was out of this world. Don't think twice about making this reservation.
September 1, 2013|Worth the drive|4|Good food ,service ..although little tight quarters but easy to reserve a table and valet parking make it a good destination
August 30, 2013|Enjoyed the outdoor patio|4|Had a nice dinner and evening on the outside patio in a party of 6. The inside tables are packed in way too tightly. The food was good. There were no complaints. The service was good too. The host was very friendly and accommodating. The waiter was attentive.
August 25, 2013|Huge menu|4|The menu has everything plus the food is very good but the service was outstanding, not to be missed
August 25, 2013|You MUST eat here !!!|5|Quick, easy drive from Framingham, seated promptly with reservation. Everyone so sweet - M'aitre 'd, water boys, OUR WAITER, ERIC, ROCKED!!!! Food was awesome - don't miss the house garlic bread :) Can't wait to go back! Don't forget to ask for Eric as your waiter!
August 25, 2013|40th Wedding Anniversary!|5|Our three children took us to Andino's for our 40th Wedding Anniversary and it was perfect. The food was exceptional (my wife and I shared veal parmagian and an order of manicotti. I has a glass of Merlot, which was very smooth. The outdoor patio setting was very nice as the early evening weather was also perfect. The canolli desert was also exceptional. I will definitely go back and try some of the other wonderful menu selections.
August 24, 2013|Andino's Rocks!!|5|This was my sixth trip to Andino's. It never disappoints. The loaded snail salad, the Chicken Andino, and the Veal Saltimbocca were all amazing. Service was great, attentive but not overly solicitous. We were happy that the hostess responded quickly to our request to be seated in the front area. Wonderful experience, will go back soon many time!! My favorite place on The Hill!
August 24, 2013|Great Italian in Federal HIll|4|This is an old-school place with a traditional Italian-American menu. All of your favorites and standards are there. The service is extremely friendly, accommodating and gracious. We arrived a little early for our table and were offered a seat in the courtyard and cocktails while we waited. We felt very well taken care of. I got the seafood and linguine special. Huge portion with lots of seasoning - more oregano than I would prefer but it was cooked well and there was plenty to share. I would say overall, the food is good - not great. However, the service and hospitality were so good, I would come back again just for that.
August 24, 2013|4 Stars because of the table|4|We had a great meal, great service but the table was awesome. First they sat us in the back of the restaurant by the door. They did ask to move us to another table because we were Open Table VIP's....but the second table was sticking out into the aisle where the wait staff and customers were making there way in and out of the restaurant. Would have been 5 stars if we had a better table!
August 23, 2013|Special Occasion|5|We had the opportunity to dine at Andinos on Aug.23. We requested a special table and that's what we got. The service was outstanding and we were very happy! We ordered 4 apps. Calamari, mozzarella sticks, squash flowers and clams casino. They were all delicious. Our portions were large and worth the money. The chicken parm that was ordered was slightly burned on the edges and that's why I gave it only 4 stars for food. Absolutely would come back.
August 17, 2013|Federal Hill Must|4|This is a small place and reservations are a must! The food is top notch and they always have great specials as well. Although I say I will try new places in Federal Hill area, I always end up back at Andino's for the consistently quality food and I never have room left for desert.
August 17, 2013|A great experience!|5|"This place was wonderful - perfect for a night out with my husband! Quiet, but not too quiet; small but not too small; they had phenomenal Italian dishes and plenty of choices! All made to order for any special requests! Excellent sangria! I would definitely recommend this place and there are many restaurants on Federal Hill, but this place was a ""5 star"" place for food and price of food and atmosphere!"
Dined on August 17, 2013|Traditional|3|Traditional Italian with large portions. Quite cramped seating so not a good choice for an intimate evening. Restaurant was very busy on a Saturday evening but our party of 4 received attentive and pleasant service. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.
August 14, 2013|Choose Wisely|3|"Our bill was much higher than our enjoyment of the experience. Food somewhat expensive for the portion size and preparation. Other reviewers had indicated the portion sizes were ""large"". Salads not included as part of meal - extra as an a la carte order. Service was chaotic. It took a very long time for the food to show up. We waited close to an hour for the main courses after we finished our appetizers and this was on a weeknight. The steaks were good (although over-priced), but the Italian dishes were not as authentic as we would have expected. The lasagna was bland, the cheese raviolis were overstuffed and not tasty."
August 10, 2013|A Charming Dining Experience|5|Having dined inside at Andino's a while ago, this restaurant definitely deserved high ratings for its food and service, but this past weekend, we had the delightful opportunity to be seated in the patio area. It is quite hidden, very spacious, yet can be a romantic escape for an evening. One can liken the experience to that of Italy. The entire waitstaff was most welcoming and our server, Stephanie, was knowledgeable, helpful, and outgoing. The entrees were perfectly prepared according to our requests and the tasty, generous portions of veal, swordfish, and eggplant pleased everyone at out table. Andino's is a cozy gem.
August 7, 2013|Andino's is a Rho' Di'lan treasure|4|Great food and classic Federal Hill. I guess that says it all!
August 4, 2013|excellent food|5|Went there for my birthday. The food was wonderful, server and staff were all great. All six of us enjoyed our meals and woukd hughly recomend this restaraunt.
August 3, 2013|Good food and service|4|We decided to go here after realizing that we had left all of our business casual close at home. You can easily be dressed up going here but we went in dark jeans and shirts nothing fancy. The service took a little while to get to us but we were told that was due to something going on so it may be quicker otherwise. The food is cooked to order as they told us. If you find something but want it changed they will work with you for it. I wish I had thought about this when it was time for desert and there was no molten brownie with ice cream. The food was very good and not dry. The bread was okay. I was brought a tall glass of water when I decided not to drink which was nice. All and all it was a very good experience.
August 2, 2013|Recommended|5|A nice, clean cozy place with very good food and a nice atmosphere. The service was outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.
August 2, 2013|very good meal.|4|lunch was great. service and food ( large portions ) were both very good
July 27, 2013|OUTSTANDING!|5|Enjoyed Andinos so much. I haven't been in over 10 years and it hasn't changed a bit. It is just as I remembered! Everything was excellent. I will be making reservations again very soon and then again!
July 21, 2013|Traditional East Coast Italian|4|Nice little place on Federal Hill. Earnest, attentive waitstaff, decent food. Extensive menu, with all of the traditional choices, prepared competently.
July 20, 2013|Always a great meal!|5|We've been dining at Andino's for years and it quickly became my favorite restaurant. We've invited both friends and family to join us on several occasions. We have always had amazing meals and great service. The veal saltimbocca is my favorite. No other restaurant compares, not even in the North End. The portions are always plentiful. The drink list is creative and delicious. It's always so busy that you need a reservation made at least 3-4 days in advance for a Saturday night. Sometimes we bring our 2 children and we've never been turned away or treated differently. They're welcoming and nice to our children, who are both now teenagers. Other Federal Hill restaurants are not as welcome to families with children.
July 13, 2013|We reserved a table for 4|3|We reserved a table for 4 and at the last minute the couple we invited had to cancel. I let the hostess know so we wouldn't tie up a larger table. What I didn't expect was to be given the worst table in the restaurant. Mary, our waitress was kind enough to move us to a table in the back which while not great was much better, when she noticed my distress. I feel that if a decent table for 2 wasn't available we should have been given the table that was originally reserved for us. Though the food was good, this perceived slight colored my feeling about the whole experience.
July 12, 2013|Great Italian food!|5|I took my date to dinner and was not disappointed. The seat was available when we arrived and the servers are very attentive. You do not sit long before they get your order. Food was delicious. I had the fruiti di mare pasta and it was enough food for two. We also ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine each and it was $60 before tip. Not bad at all!
July 7, 2013|very good meal.|4|We had not been to Andino's for some time. glad we returned . Entrees ( sod, chicken were excellent. salad just ok. servive was fair ( restaurant was very busy0 but all in all a goos meal
July 2, 2013|A must!!!!|5|The service is great!!! The food even better! They make you feel at home!!
July 2, 2013|Great friends/great foods|5|This is our third visit to Andino's - two lunches, one dinner. Food is outstanding! Make sure you try the fried mozzarella (not even the same species as those frozen cheese sticks). Eggplant parmigiana is unique because of the way the eggplant is folded(?) which keeps it moist but not disintegrated -- absolutely delicious. Our waiter was attentive, responsive, but not obtrusive. The décor is pleasant, the tables are nicely spaced. in short, if you go to Providence and you like Italian food then you MUST go to Andino's!

The appetizer selection was wonderful and we settled on a seafood medley that was enough for all 4 of us and then some. I normally dine in the north end of Boston and this restaurant was just as wonderful for food. However, what was missing is the historic charm of Hanover St in Boston."

June 9, 2013|Food|2|Food not that great. Ordered several veal dishes between our group and with each dish, the veal was tough. Also, not happy about paying $5.00 extra per portion for pasta. On a good note, the pink sauce was better than the alfredo and pesto.
