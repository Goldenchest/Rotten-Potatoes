February 23, 2016|Glad to have the opportunity to try this place|5|I've patronized nearby Oki's my entire life, and while my newfound love of Jacky's hasn't diminished my enjoyment of Oki's, I'm glad that OpenTable opened up this opportunity to try something new. I will absolutely go back again. The place is GORGEOUS. I loved the outdoor manmade stream that ran under the entrance with see-through panels. Music in the dining area is soft, so I can actually hear my softspoken boyfriend. Food is fantastic. The hot n' sour soup is among the best I've had. The eel sushi was great, as was the gyoza.
February 14, 2016|5 Star Sushi|5|I've been to Jackies numerous times and am never disappointed. The staff is always accommodating (if we are a larger group) and the food is always perfect!

October 10, 2015|Beautiful restaurant, certain menu items were good|3|This place is beautiful and certain items are very tasty (i.e. lettuce wraps are amazing, great sushi rolls). However, the entrees were disappointing. Specifically, I was disappointed in size of the portions and there was nothing amazing, flavor-wise, about the entrees. The Peking Duck was very dry and lacked flavor, the fried rice, vegetables, and fried noodle dish were very bland compared to the Boston Chinatown restaurants . I would come here for the appetizers and sushi, but nothing else.

September 6, 2015|A Solid Option in North Providence|4|I've dined at Jacky's in North Providence several times. Food quality and sushi are always very good. The decor is modern and fabulous. Restaurant wasn't busy at all, which was a bit of a surprise. Service was just OK. Waitress did not appear that familiar with the menu and we needed to direct traffic to get plates to the right person at the table. Steak tips are my go to hot item, are always delicious, and always come home for another meal.

August 28, 2015|Service slow tonight. Usually very good|3|Went on a whim on a Friday night. Hostess lacked expression. Walked us to our table and immediately walk away without comment. Took quite a while before someone came to our table. Waiter quite but polite. Seafood egg drop soup was not very good. Rest of the food was quite good. Would definitely return. Maybe just a bad night.

March 6, 2015|First visit. Glitzy decor, reasonable prices|3|Worth a visit, this year old spot is a glamorous setting, sushi was good not great, prices reasonable, service from Gabrielle excellent, management attentive.
February 14, 2015|Lovely, but|4|The ambience, cocktails, and service were outstanding. My only complaint was my lobster dinner had shell on every bite, thereby necessitating using my fingers to eat it. But it was covered in slick sauce, making it quite difficult to eat. I would recommend this restaurant, but advise you skip the lobster.

December 25, 2014|Food was cold|3|The overall experience was ok. Our server was nice and attentive but the food was cold and they made a mistake in the kitchen which in turn we got our appetizers and food at the same time. We probably won't go back there. We decided to have Christmas and my birthday there because it was just the two of us, my boyfriend and I. Would've much rather have gone to a place in providence.
November 28, 2014|Fabulous evening spent with Family Gold .|5|Fabulous evening spent with Family Gold - delicious food, awesome service and dining experience with small, medium or large party or family. Highly recommend!
November 19, 2014|JACKIE'S GALAXY - OUTSTANDING|5|Jackie's new digs on Mineral Spring Avenue in North Providence, Rhode Island is a wonderful dining experience ! The food is exemplary, service and attention with a smile and efficiency, a full dining menu and savory food to enjoy. ...it does not get much better than that for Asian dining. Our 4th time as dinner guests was as good as the 1st time !
November 15, 2014|absolutely amazing|5|The food here is amazing. We were in a group of four and we went to town on the various sushi offerings. Really nice atmosphere, service was very good, probably one of the best experiences we've had at this type of restaurant. It's worth going here just for the sushi pizza. It was so good we ordered another one after finishing everything else.
October 19, 2014|Missing a few marks|3|I will definitely try it again here, but some things were just off and for the price of the sushi(city prices) it needs to be better. The sushi we had was all average and the rolls are all around $14 for north providence that's high. The pan fried noodles had zero flavor and Werner seasoned and then we also got room temperature wine, the second bottle was better. The place is very pretty but they need to work on the food flavor wise. We were the only people in there on a Sunday for the first hour. The specials were all $14 rolls so not special really. Very very expensive. I will try again when I hear more buzz but right now il stick with Haruki and tokyo in providence.
October 16, 2014|Totally great!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|4|the service at Jackie's is great! Regardless of when I called for reservations, they did not have my table ready at all, and I had a 10+ group. But the manager was gracious and sat my party in the VIP room. The food is top notch oriental cuisine, the bar area comfortable and away from the restaurant bustle. The sushi has endless combinations, and I prefer the vegetarian rolls as well. The amount of food is great, and the price I believe very reasonable for the quality. Though the location is a bit off putting to the restaurant's caliber. Overall, 4 1/2 stars, and totally recommend it for parties, dates, or a nice night out, even a late lunch. ( as a side note, the Truffle Mousse is to DIE for!)
October 4, 2014|GREAT experience|4|Highly recommend this restaurant! Great ambiance. Very cool dining area and bar. Awesome food ... just wish they also had traditional Chinese food as an option.
September 11, 2014|Jacky's on both sides of the street|4|Wonderful food and service. Extensive menu. Something for everyone. Helpful server. Tab for 2 w/appetizer and drinks $77. One point - if you are going for the first time there are 2 restaurants; both Jadkie's Galaxie. One is mainly takeout though i don't know why - lovely seating area. From Pawtucket it is on the right. Further down the street on the left just after Dunkin Donuts is the main restaurant. Parking is ample and is in the back.
July 24, 2014|Lovely spot|4|The food and service were wonderful. The inside is beautiful!
July 11, 2014|Satisfied|5|Food was great. I loved the tuna dumplings! My friend and I were satisfied overall with the food and service.
June 14, 2014|Pleasantly surprised|5|Not being from the area, we took a chance on finding an Asian restaurant at the time we needed. Certainly not located in a beautiful area, but as you step through the doors you see that they spent a ton of money building a spectacular interior. From the lights, stone walls, wine area, etc. And the food was really nice with decent portions that we shared.
June 6, 2014|Ms|5|What a great place! The food, service and ambience were all well-above expectation for a local restaurant. It was also great to find that they were able to accomodate my gluten-free diet!
June 4, 2014|Service|5|From day one came in met the manager wonderful personality. Took care of my needs. 2ndday came in with b=day cake still excellent service. Waitress was excellent. All in all great service and will return

May 11, 2014|Mother's Day Lunch...|4|Had a 1:30 reservation for 12; waited 20 minutes for them to set it up for us. What? It was a surprise?? Things went better from there, waitress was extremely attentive and gave everyone individual attention; I liked that very much. I don't think I would come back for normal dining, I think that they did a great job with the large party I brought, but there's no intimacy here for two to four diners; the place is too large and the pace is fast. Even though it was fairly busy, there was no noticeable noise from other tables, which was also positive. Hope this helps...
May 11, 2014|Mother's Day Brunch Buffet|5|I was extremely excited to try the Mother's Day Buffet. We dine at Jacky's a few times per month and have always been completely satisfied. The atmosphere was great and the selection was the best I have seen in many years. Everything was delicious and as soon as one pan would run low they would bring out refills. There was no waiting for food to be replenished. They also brought out different dishes throughout the time I was there. That was a nice surprise. Each time I went up there was something new added. The sushi was great and the deserts were wonderful. I hope they do another one for Father's Day and all the holidays after that !!!

May 3, 2014|enjoyable|5|We enjoyed our meal and drinks the resaurant is beautifully decorated
May 3, 2014|Great Ambiance!|4|restaurant is modern and fun, beautiful decor, upscale chinese food.
Dined on May 3, 2014|Special|5|From the moment we walked into Jackie's - the space was magical, with beautiful uplighting and light fixtures. The menu was varied with many choices starting with sushi and maki. Great appetizers and entrees and a section on noodle dishes. The waitress was very affable yet professional who was very familiar with the menu. Great drink menu with signature cocktails and a strong wine list. The food was amazing, very fresh and flavorful. Started with the coconut shrimp with mango sauce, Philadelphia maki (smoked salmon and cream cheese), Chicken with green beans and a garlic sauce and shanghai noodles with shrimp and chicken plus an order of pineapple fried rice. The food was plentiful with enough to take home. Highly recommend.
May 2, 2014|Excellent|4|Food was excellent, beautiful decor, great service- have already told many friends about the experience and will definitely return!
April 13, 2014|Terrific|5|Everyone in our party of 5 had never been there before. Waitress was very good about giving suggestions for appetizers and entrees. Service was prompt and attentive, food was excellent and plentiful. Salmon in teriyaki sauce and steak tips were especially good. Decor and ambiance were both incredible. Beautiful interior.. Will definitely go back.
April 12, 2014|Noise level issue|4|"Congraulations to a new and beautiful Jacky's! The consistent food and good service is everything Jacky's stands for. Unfortunately, the noise level is so loud I could hardly hear the person across my table. If there is any way to add some kind of buffer walls to ""cushion"" the noise, it would create a more intimate and comfortable environment."
April 11, 2014|Delicious and beautiful|5|Jacky's new restaurant could help change the face of Mineral Spring Avenue. The food and atmosphere are delicious.
March 28, 2014|Wonderful Evening of Sushi|5|Great food, service, friendly staff. Can't wait to go back...
