ays ago|Top notch dining|5|We eat at Flemings about once a month. Always a pleasure to eat there. Service is always wonderful as is the food. The couple times we have had an issue it as been handled just as you would expect when you are paying this amount for a level of high quality food and service. Matt Barnes is hands down the best server I have ever encountered. He remembers who you are, what your preference is as far as food and drinks, even others in your party that have been with you one visit. Matt makes every penny we spend worth it.
February 20, 2016|Outstanding experience all around!|5|My wife and I have been to Flemings Providence before and thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. The service, food, drinks and vibe was perfect and made fir a great evening for our dear friends birthday celebration. The service from Jeff our waiter and attention and pleasnt greeting from Manny the Manager contribued to our wonderful time. Flemings in Providence is a must go if your looking for that perfect dining experience.

Calamari, homemade Burrata, Steaks were outstanding selected a variety of ribeye, NY strip, filet with the coffee rub or porcini mushrooms. And the chocolate lava cakes were made to order and outstanding. Service was perfect - just enough when you need it. Loved the bday gift the restaurant gave to the guests of honor very nice touch !!

February 14, 2016|ran out of steak|1|busy valentines day, ordered after sitting for 30 mins. then 40 mins later i was told they were out of what i ordered. picked what they told me was left. then 30 mins later they told me they were out of that too and that our meal was free. took 2 plus hours to have a meal, was ridiculous. food is good but planning on their part was bad for a holiday weekend.
February 14, 2016|was just ok|2|We arrived early and notified hostess. We were sat 10 minutes later than my reservation, No big deal. This was Valentines Day do I know its busy. We were presented our menus and waiter took our drink order . Place had a strange selection of music playing for a fine dining Restaurant. After deciding what would like for dinner we were told they were out of the Filet .????Really Valentines Day and your out? Also no mashed potatoes ,,wow. I ordered the Prime Rib. ordered it Medium ,it looked as though it was put on the grill. Greyish on the outside with seared ends. The meat itself was medium rare when cut into. Other than that, my wife had the petite Filet which she enjoyed. With all the high end steak houses out there, I doubt Flemings will get my business again
February 14, 2016|Flemings|4|The food was delicious and service was wonderful. The warm bread and cheese spreads are to die for! And our ceasur salads had bacon, awesome. The wine was perfect. The meals and side also delicious. However for the price, the sides shoujld come with the meal. Very expensive restaurant and night out.
February 14, 2016|not as expected|1|My wife and I have gone to Flemings for many years and always go on valentine’s day. This year to our surprise Flemings a steakhouse was out of Ribeye steaks, this is unacceptable in my book. The waiter recommended the craftsman Ribeye which they did have and to our surprise it was horrible and not at all what we expected. This was a disappointing experience and our last time going to Flemings.

February 12, 2016|Great Steak!  Great Service!|5|The occasion was to celebrate our son's birthday. Upon arrival the hostess was nice but did not make us welcomed at first. Our table was not ready and after standing for a few mintues not sure what was the issue, she stated why we were waiting and apologized. The waiter was great and the manager greeted everyone to make sure the customers experience was to their liking. My children, although teenagers were spoken to and treated the same, which is rare in some restaurants. The food was fantastic and everyone's steak was cooked to perfection.

The kitchen you can see, but you just see the servers and manager hanging out. Wasn't very comforting. The host staff wasn't very friendly the closer hostess was more friendly then the one we first met.
January 30, 2016|Good meal|4|We have eaten here before and feel as if the service and the quality moderately fell this visit. The steak was not cook to perfection and in fact was a little underdone and the french fries were way over done. The salads were both great and the cheesecake was fantastic. They seem to trying to squeeze as many tables as possible into the space which diminishes from the ambiance.
January 30, 2016|Lovely evening|4|We reserved at Flemings since it was part of the Omni hotel where we were staying and it was very convenient. We were seated immediately upon arrival even though we were a bit early for our reservation. This was our choice as the hostess asked us if we wanted to have a drink at the bar first but we chose not to do so. The restaurant was not really crowded. The service was a little slow but, that being said, our waiter Edgar was very good - very personable and knowledgeable. My husband had mushoom ravioli for his appetizer and loved it! Our entrees were excellent - I had seared ahi and my husband had the bone-in filet. We were both very happy with our choices. The only issue we had was that it took forever for my husband to get his first glass of wine. My mixed drink came and we waited a while for his glass of wine. His appetizer was finished by the time it came. He also ordered another different wine to accompany his dinner but we waited a very long time for that as well. Our waiter did finally come back and tell us that they did not have the wine hubby ordered and that they even went to the sister restaurant on the second floor to check to see if they had it. We appreciated the effort but wish he would have come and told us why it was taking so long. He suggested another similar wine which was brought fairly quickly but my husband was almost done with his dinner by that time. We had reservations for 5:45 and were done at 7:15 - a little longer than I had planned to be at dinner but not a real issue since our tickets to Cabaret were for 8 pm. Still out in plenty of time. When we left, the place was hopping so I guess later dinner reservations would have made it harder for us to catch the show. All in All, we would probably go again!

January 22, 2016|superlative dinner|5|We brought my mother to Flemings for her 85th birthday celebration. The staff treated her and the entire party like royalty. Our waiter Ken was very attentive.
January 22, 2016|What a fantastic night out with friends!...|5|What a fantastic night out with friends! We went for restaurant week so it wasn't too expensive and the food and service were awesome! The steak was delicious and sides were good, too!
January 18, 2016|Lovely Experience|5|We eat at Flemings several times a year. We have always had excellent servers, very good food and delightful wines. And, we do enjoy the follow- up emails thanking us for dining there.
January 17, 2016|Waiter not attentive.  strip steak VERY fatty.|2|The waiter never checked in with me personally to see if my meal was good, cooked to satisfaction, etc. All of his questions and comments were addressed to my husband. Even my husband noticed this!!!! For the amount of $ we spent, we could've had 3 FABULOUS meals elsewhere.
December 31, 2015|Fleming's is a definite recommend for dinner|5|If you enjoy steak Fleming's is the best. We have eaten there twice this week and the food is delicious and consistent. Over the year's Fleming's gas become our go to restaurant not only for the amazing food but the wine list us outstanding. I would recommend attending one if their seasonal wine tasting events. They have quite,a large selection of fabulous wine and spirits. One evening we actually were with some out of town friends and my husband wanted B and B. At that time , for whatever reason they stopped carrying it. Chris Watson made a special trip over to the Omni hotel to get a glass of B and B for my husband. And now they carry it again at Fleming's. Now that's what I call exceeding g your customers expectations. I also would highly recommend the lobster tempura..it is by far the best small plate I have ever had anywhere. Thanks Fleming's for always being one of our favorite places to enjoy a fabulous meal and a great time.
December 31, 2015|Delicious New Year|4|Despite having reservation, we had to wait about 40 min for a table. But the food was very tasty. Worth the wait.
December 31, 2015|Not quite as good this time.|3|I have been to Fleming's a couple of times before and it was outstanding. Very special in every way. I invited some family and friends this time, for New Year's eve. Dinner at 7:30. The NOISE was very loud. Impossibly so. Yes, it was packed. Normal for New Year's, of course. But we couldn't here any of our conversations across the table, the whole evening. As to the food, one of my guests said it was 'average'. Another ordered an accompaniment to their steak and it was 'ice cold'. It was promptly fixed, but shouldn't have been that way in the first place. Too, the service was prompt for drinks and 1st course, but the wait between the 1st and entrees was v-e-r-y long. The latter was the case the last time we were there as well. We would return, but not on a busy night like New Year's eve. For a birthday or something, yes.
December 29, 2015|Good food - average experience|4|Being one of the higher end steak houses, expectations tend to be a little higher. The food was very good. We expected a little more on the service side of things. We were well past our cocktails (empty glasses) and had ordered wine, but it did not come until well into our dinner.
December 28, 2015|Fabulous and quiet|5|A night without kids and the service was top notch and impeccable. Highly recommend and worth every penny.

Unacceptble at a nice restaurant. A function was going on in function room next door and crowd was loud and traffic passing my chair was annoying.
December 12, 2015|Amazing|5|Great food, very hospitable and great wine list. It is on the pricey side but well worth it.
December 11, 2015|The staff was awesome and the food was superb!|5|Cynthia was our waitress and she was fabulous! So attentive and pleasant ! The manager brought us a box of truffles because we were celebrating our anniversary. We had s wonderful evening!
December 10, 2015|Poorly cooked meal|3|Second time here this week. Again the steak was extremely over cooked. We also ordered asparagus that was butchered. So overdone it was ridiculous. Terrible quality coming out of the kitchen. 2X in one week is not an accident.
December 8, 2015|Ruined my steak 2x in one week|3|Stayed at the Omni and ate here twice. Both times the steak was extremely undercooked or over cooked. We won't take groups here any longer too many other quality choices
December 4, 2015|Birthday celebration|5|Brought my best friend in for her birthday dinner. She loved it! Service was excellent and dinner was exceptional. She was even given a gift certificate and gift from the staff. Nice touch!! On returning to work, she recommended Flemmings to her boss. It's so nice when life is perfect.
November 28, 2015|Marcie|5|The staff was excellent from host to our waiter Jeffrey. The other staff as well . Food was amazing

I have always enjoyed the Flemington, however the last 2 times I have had it I must say it was not anything to write home about. It was just ordinary. I think if we go again I will just order a regular steak. Also, our server did not bring out any special desert as she stated she would because of my birthday.

I believe this was the quietest table in the restaurant and it helped make for a successful dining experience. Thanks.

November 19, 2015|Delicious|5|Awesome dinner at Flemings .. Split a Wedge salad .. We had filets that were delicious and split a loaded baked potato.. Filling for the potato were on he side which was great! The best was the chocolate lava cake... Perfect size to split ... Very nice - relaxing and delicious evening!

November 4, 2015|Good Steak house on Hotel  premises|3|"I've eaten at this restaurant several times over the past 5 years and always gave it high marks. My most recent visit was two days ago and I ate here two nights in a row. The first night I enjoyed a succulent NY Strip Steak, the second night I ordered the Alaskan King crab legs and I was very disappointed. For almost $50.00 they brought me out a plate that had Five 4"" long legs on it and they were not even fresh, I could tell they were frozen before prepared as they tasted exactly like the ones you can buy from your average grocery store. Poor quality for the price. I will never do that again."
November 3, 2015|The BEST!!!|5|This restaurant is top notch in every way. From the moment we walked in the staff was genuinely upbeat and happy to have us there. The night continued in the same vein and the food was perfect in every way for all of us (five). It is pricey, but worth every penny!
October 31, 2015|Pleasantly surprised|5|Was not my top choice-but will definitely go back! Loved it!!! Dinner and wine (selection) were great...and dessert was superb! Thank you!
October 31, 2015|Always Amazing!|5|"Fleming's has once again impressed my husband and I with the way the management and the waitstaff make one's visit the very best it could possibly be. Beginning with the greeting at the hostess station, and continuing at the table by Manager Steve, our wonderful waiter, Tom, and so many of the waitstaff who have served us in prior visits, this ""family"" is incredible. The food remains five star without a doubt. With great food, and everyone making sure our food and overall evening meet the perfection level, I must say that the experience continues to be an amazing one."
October 30, 2015|Steak Your Claim Here|5|Pleasantly surprised! Pros: Steaks were done to perfection. Service with a smile was impeccable, Ala-cart dishes were fantastic. Atmosphere was very good. Cons: More American forward wine list, a weak at best global selection. When you decide to offer the European flavors of Truffle, American wines don't make the cut. Ok, I know many of you love to saturate your pallets with oak, to each his own, but just try the Ziobaffi Italian red with your meal. You wont regret it. Leave your oak soaked pallet at home and you will taste the flavors of your meal as they were intended So overall, be prepared to spend, but quality will be your reward. I will definitely go back!

October 29, 2015|Worst dining experience ever|1|This was my first time dining at Fleming’s in Providence and was the absolute worst dining experience ever. We had reservations at 5:45 and were literally 2 of 8 patrons in the entire main dining room. The hostess walked us past a room full of empty tables and booths to a table approximately 10 feet from the door leading into what was a private “pre-game” party of about 30 inebriated adults going to the Patriots game that evening. It was extremely loud and distracting as the door was continuously swinging open. Then one of the partiers propped the door open they could go in and out easier. We politely requested to be moved away from the ruckus, but our server asked us to sit tight because the crowd was leaving soon. One waiter closed the door, but it continued to swing open as they went in and out. Then one of the partiers propped open the door again and we had to close it ourselves. By now our food had arrived and as we are trying to eat, our table was constantly surrounded by yelling adults who were going in and out of the private room. Someone was unsuccessfully trying to shepherd them to a bus outside, and by the time they left, we were practically finished with our meals. I will admit that food was delicious. We were offered a “complimentary” dessert even though we had declined dessert just a few minutes earlier. The manager then came to apologize and although we didn’t request a discount, he reduced our bill by $50. That was a nice token, but just barely covered one steak and baked potato. I’m still incredulous at the experience. I’m 50sh, my companion 40sh, both professionals; both well dressed, and were seated at the absolute worst table in a virtually empty restaurant. I can’t understand how a wait staff and a manager can be so clueless. All they had to do was move us to another table on the other side of the restaurant, especially when we asked to be moved. I mean, this is Fleming’s not a sports bar!

October 17, 2015|Awesome|5|Truly a great evening, wonderful serivce and excellent food for a group of 10
October 17, 2015|A legitimate Steak Joint in Providence|5|We were very pleased with Flemings (once we found the entrance - too many flags around the building). Good steaks, even by Manhattan standards. We had a time constraint, and our waiter responded appropriately - service was as quick as we would have liked, and quite attentive. Next time we'll linger and enjoy more courses.
October 16, 2015|The best steakhouse in providence.|5|The best steakhouse in providence without question. Service was outstanding and the food was perfect. Great drinks as well!
October 12, 2015|This was a birthday celebration and we h...|2|This was a birthday celebration and we had a delicious meal in a lovely establishment. HOWEVER, before leaving home for our dinner I called to inform Flemings that I would be a accompanied by two ladies celebrating birthdays and asked if they were able to arrange for a desert with candle for each as a celebration. I was told that they had desert to which a candle could be added and I asked that they take care of it. I expected to be charged for the desert but I did expect that at the end of our meal the desert would appear with candles. Flemings apparently has a different interpretation of this birthday arrangement and expected that we would order desert and the candle would be added. I don't know what the reason for my call was. It really took the edge of an otherwise special evening. To be fair they did comp the deserts and sent us home with extra goodies. We were also greeted at the door with birthday wishes and there were cards on the table. So I suppose I am just a little old fashioned in believing that requesting a birthday desert in advance should mean that something appears at the appropriate time to top off the special occasion.
October 10, 2015|What a find!!!|5|I have been looking for a great steakhouse. I never thought I was find such an amazing place. The food was so delicious. The steak was without a doubt absolutely the perfect fillet I have ever had. Dessert blew our minds. Chocolate flourless lava cake - was a soufflé so light and decadent. Loved it and will be back.
October 2, 2015|First trip,|4|"Excellent service, excellent help with finding a very, very good bottle of wine. But. He failed to mention to my wife apparently the way she ordered her petit fillet steak ""it came with"" their BBQ sauce. Huh? What? Flemings is all about seasoning your steak. Be careful. I specifically ordered my very good rib eye just the steak, and still got their famous (?) salt and pepper crust for lack of a better word. On a high note, their espresso was excellent, as was the creme brûlée. But you have to be mindful of their four sauces and two or three ways they want to cook your steak. It was a great rib eye."
September 18, 2015|Being a Midwestern it's hard to come by ...|5|Being a Midwestern it's hard to come by good steak Flemings has the best steak I've had since I've moved to Rhode Island big thumbs up.
September 12, 2015|Excellent all around!|5|We celebrated our son's 14th birthday and Fleming's was the perfect choice! He sat down to a birthday card signed by the staff, received a gift card to return and a box of handmade truffles! Our party of 8 thoroughly enjoyed every last bite of food from salads to desserts. Service was exceptional, our meal was well paced and every need was well attended to!
September 5, 2015|Great Food, Atmosphere|4|"The great: Fabulous food (had the mussels and pork belly appetizers, rib eye for dinner). Service was impeccable. Not so great: They ""ran out"" of the aged rib eye (for a steak house??). A group of 8 men sat next to us and were incredibly loud and used very bad language. A couple at a nearby table complained to no avail (it was not crowded but they were not moved to a farther table) and they ended up leaving. We stuck it out through our meal but left before dessert. Final: We'll definitely come back but hoping for some improvement on the above points."
August 22, 2015|Food, service and ambience abound.|5|From the reception we received upon arrival through our eventual exit, we felt not only welcomed but valued as guests. I've been to this Flemings several times over the years and have never had anything other than a good experience. Last night's dinner, however, may well have been the best experience of all. Our server, Lori, along with the rest of the staff not only provided a first class experience, but really blew away my girlfriend. We were there celebrating her birthday and had never been to a Flemings before. The quality of the meal, the doting yet professional service and the atmosphere of the restaurant lived up to my hype and left her thoroughly impressed. Thank you.
July 30, 2015|Just a bit off..|4|Flemings in Providence is one of my favorites because it's tucked in the lobby of the Omni Hotel. The restaurant was practically empty the night our group went yet more than once we were looking for our waiter to refill drinks. Overall, nice atmosphere good food but it just missed the mark for service on this particular night.
July 24, 2015|fine, but rushed|3|Our meal was tasty and our service was friendly, but it was obvious they were trying to turn the table, our plates were cleared before we were finishes chewing our last bites.
July 23, 2015|Awesome food and service|5|The waiter, Edgar, was very attentive , food suggestions were right on, and wine list excellent choices. Had a great time and will definitely go back. One of my favorite restaurants.
July 20, 2015|Excellent as always|5|We took my wife to Flemings for her birthday because it is her favorite restaurant. Best steak on the planet. Everything was excellent as always. Highly recommend!
July 18, 2015|Overall, the food was great and service ...|4|Overall, the food was great and service definitely attentive, and knowledgable. The only constructive feedback would the ambience, it's too dark and feels gloomy - hard to see what you're actually eating.
July 16, 2015|Lovely Evening at Fleming's|5|We had been to Fleming's before on various occasions. We decided to bring our friends who had never been there. It was Providence Restaurants Week so we took advantage of the prix fixe dinners. The food was delicious as usual. I started off with squash ravioli which was out of this world. My main course was twin filet mignons wrapped in bacon which was cooked to perfection. This was accompanied by mashed potatoes and Fleming's delicious creamed spinach. Dessert was a very decadent chocolate cake. We had a wonderful waiter. Everything was perfect. Our friends enjoyed themselves and said they would go back.
July 15, 2015|Restaurant Week|1|Flemings is typically a family favorite for our family of 4. Unfortunately not the case during restaurant week. The side portions that were suppose to be a family sized portions were small and only suitable for a party of 2 birds. However the filet was good . The service was poor as our server was more interested in the table alongside us who ordered champagne than in servicing us. Major disappointment both in food and service :(
July 14, 2015|The food was amazing! Will be going back!|5|The service was amazing and the food was incredible. We had butternut squash ravioli for an appetizer and it was perfect, so good. We then had the twin filets, one wrapped in bacon and one plain. Both were cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. They also have a fabulous wine selection as well as some delicious mixed cocktails

July 12, 2015|Not worth the time|1|Inconsistent food Too many servers Poor portion size Inflated prices for inadequate food
July 3, 2015|Not worth the cost.|2|Ordered a rib rib eye steak cooked medium. It was sent back to kitchen, when I got it back it looked like it was microwaved' I did'nt eat it. They offered to deduct the cost of a glass of wine.
June 14, 2015|Always Memorable|5|Flemings is our favorite steak house for special occasions and this last visit did not disappoint. Our service from the minute we entered the restaurant was wonderful. My companion ordered the prime rib special and I ordered the petite filet - the meat was cooked to,perfection for both of us and beyond favorable, too. Also a special note about the new Caesar salad - crisp , light and nicely presented. We look forward to our next visit !

June 10, 2015|Best steak in Povidence!|4|This is a great steakhouse. Nice atmosphere with booths and separate rooms! Not noisy and loud. Great service.
June 6, 2015|5 star  Neighborhood Steak house|5|This restaurant is 5 star from the service to the food and wine. Location is prime. Whether I sit in the bar or restaurant to dine the experience has always been notch.
May 29, 2015|Great cocktails|5|Great cocktails
May 23, 2015|An Excellent Choice|4|Flemings is always a goood choice, especailly for a special occasion. The service was excellent and atmosphere was just as nice. You could have a conversation with out having to raise your voice or move to another seat in order to talk wiht someone. We were there for my daughter's college graduation celebration. The staff had a specail card at her place to congratulate her on her accomplishment and catered to her ever need during our time there. I highly recommend Flemings in Providence for any special occasion.
May 9, 2015|Always excellent!|5|Flemings, in my estimation, is the best steakhouse in the USA. I love the sides. Their wedge is outstanding as is the mushrooms, mac and cheese and especially the Fleming potatoes! Service is second to none.
May 9, 2015|Best Steakhouse around!|5|Fleming's has become our go to restaurant for special events and specail evenings. The food is excellent with great presentstion and service. It was our aniversary and we got a card signed by the staff with some truffles in a box when we left. That kind treatment means everything.
May 2, 2015|There are better options...|3|We were given a gift card so we went. It was my first time at Flemings. When opting for a high end steak experience, our choice had always been Capital Grille. CG will remain our choice. Like CG, Flemings is very expensive, but you expect that going in. For that expense, you expect perfection...Flemings failed badly on that count. Service was excellent, and our server did a very good job. I ordered the NY Strip, and my wife had the Petite Filet. The steaks were excellent and met our expectations...cooked as ordered, tender, perfect. Since that's the main event I suppose the question is why am I complaining? Everything else bordered on awful, given what you're paying for it. The Caesar salad had no flavor, hardly a drop of dressing. The crab cakes were barely there (for $16). The creamed spinach side was watery and again there was just not enough, given the cost (trust me, we're normal eaters). The baked potato was fine, but nothing special. The martinis were well made but the pours left a little too much open space (for $15). Without dessert, the tab including tip, $9 to park + $5 for the valet, broke the $300 mark for 2 people...btw, well more than my gift certificate. I'm ok with that...but I expect perfection, and there's just not enough of it to bring me back. The irony is that all the little things can be fixed...however you only get one chance to make that first impression that insures a return trip. We'll stick to the CG. Btw...if you want a good steak, with great fixins at half the cost (hyperbole), try the Parkside.
Dined on April 25, 2015|Stunning as Always|5|My girlfriend and I used to go to the Flemings up in Boston all the time. This one in Providence is just the same with food quality, service, and ambiance. I have never seen my dad enjoy a steak like he did here. I came here for my graduation and they treated me and everyone great. I was given a card signed by the staff and chefs saying congratulations. I have never gone somewhere that held that much respect to their guests. At the end, they gave me a box of their truffles and a $25 card for next time I go back. If you want service, come here! Drinks were made perfectly. The only thing that was not up to par, in my opinion were the french fries, haha. They are much better up in Boston. But overall, get the steak. You are at a steakhouse of course!
April 18, 2015|Food did not meet my expectations|3|Went to Fleming's with another couple for my birthday on April 18th. the hostess and server were very nice. However, I found the food disappointing for what they charge. Got he $57 bone in rib eye. It was just okay. I order it at every high end steakhouse I go to. The Capital Grille and Del Frisco's are better. The ladies both ordered the special, the $44 six ounce filet and three grilled shrimp. they weren't cooked properly. The appetizers (mussels and crab cakes) were good. The creme brulee was good as well. They have a nice wine list.
April 18, 2015|Disappointed and expensive|2|We were excited to take our Brown student out for a nice meal, but it ended up being a disappointment. Our meal was served an hour after we ordered, and our daughter's salmon was cold. We ordered 2 baked potatoes and they were dried out and came with one set of toppings for $21.95! Once the salmon came back hot-2 small pieces on a large plate-it was dried out. My vegetarian plate was swimming in olive oil, and my husband's sea bass was just OK. We were looking forward to the lava cake to end on a good note, and that also took longer than expected and was just fine. Even though the manager had to come over to our table twice, he didn't even offer a comped dessert.
April 12, 2015|Good, but losing their touch|3|I've been going to Fleming's for years, and bragging about the Providence location for just as long. It started with a girl I was dating, and we went all the time. Then I introduced my mother and brother to the restaurant, and now it's a common choice for birthdays, mother's days, and special treats. When I go there, the bill is between $300 and $600, and that's for a maximum of 4 people. We each order several drinks, we take advantage of the nice appetizer menu, we get sides with our entrees, and we each usually order a large or exclusive steak. The service is usually spectacular, with the manager and each of the chefs stopping by our table to make sure we had everything we needed, and even just for nice conversation. This time was different. Our waiter (Chris) was very attentive, as were the others who bus tables and refill water glasses (Kris). No complaints there, at all. The manager walked by our table numerous times and was often standing by the entrance to the open kitchen, just talking. There was no excuse for him not to stop by our table. Fleming's is a restaurant that sells a la carte sides, for the table, and the sides used to be well portioned. Not anymore. A side of asparagus came with 12 pieces, and the truffled mashed potatoes (that taste excellent) were half the size I last saw them (August '14). So that the other 3 people at my table could have a fair amount, I elected not to have any mashed potatoes. It's also worth mentioning the smaller portions did not come with a smaller price. During our entree course, I asked if I could buy a bottle of an ice win for the table that is usually only sold by the glass. Chris said he'd check with the manager. I didn't get a final price for the bottle for about 25 minutes, after watching the manager and Chris talk many, many times. I get the feeling the manager was slacking and that Chris reminded the manager every time I reminded Chris. Again, I do not think Chris was to blame.
April 12, 2015|A great early dinner before a show at PPAC.|5|We were the second table seated at 4:30pm on a Sunday. Service was outstanding and food was excellent. We shared the seafood tower (the crab legs were great!) and carpaccio. My filet was slightly underdone, but not too much and I'd rather it that way than overdone. Molten chocolate cake was also great. Our servers and all staff were attentive but not overly. And I just love a restaurant with decor such as Fleming's-lots of woodwork, old school 60's vibe. And we actually loved the music too!
April 9, 2015|rwhogg|5|My wife and I had a great meal, along with a couple of excellent drinks, and a great bottle of wine. And, the service was oustanding.
March 29, 2015|Dishonest|2|"Flemings has a Sunday prime rib 3 course special advertised on their website for 29.99. When you get there they don't metioned it you have to ask. It's a 12oz prime rib and outrvwaiter asked if we wanted the 14oz for a dollar or 2 more ""really"" a dollar or 2.. Once my meal came it wasn't cooked medium rare more on the medium side. So the bill comes and its 120.00! How is that if its 29.99 and I got an extra 2 ounces for a few bucks more with just a glass of wine that would be 60 a piece. I understand the waiter is suppose to upsell but be honest about it.. Not worth it at all"
March 24, 2015|Good. Not Great.|3|We come back here every other month or so. This most recent experience didn't quite live up to the rest. Service was not as good as previous experiences. Steaks were above average but not memorable. We spent $300 (with tip) for two guests and left underwhelmed. For the money, there are other places close by that we'll be trying first before we come visit here again.
March 14, 2015|Overpriced, this was a one shot deal for...|3|Overpriced, this was a one shot deal for my wife and I. Good really does not live up to the price tag. I've had better steaks for a better price.
March 10, 2015|Wonderful Food, Terrific Service,|5|We were in Providence for one night only for the Neil Diamond Concert. We chose this restaurant from Trip Advisor since we were not familiar with the area. We were totally thrilled with our experience at Fleming's Steakhouse and would highly recommend this restaurant. My husband said that his Sea Bass dish was the best he had ever had and my Filet Mignon was perfect. We will recommend this restaurant to our friends.
March 9, 2015|Birthday Dinner|5|I took a friend out for her birthday since she had never been. I told the restaurant and everyone wished her a Happy Birthday, and she received a birthday card, a $25 gift card, and some chocolates. The Lobster Tempura was fabulous as always, her Wagyu steak was delicious, and the Chantilly Cream I had been raving about didn't dissapoint. She said it was her best birthday ever.
March 7, 2015|A very disappointing dining experience|1|Our party of four was seated 50 minutes after our 7 pm reservation. The service was extremely slow and our server barely slowed down to tell us the many entrees they were out of. The expensive sides, although very good, were so small we ordered two more once we saw them. All of us agreed that the beef entrees that we ordered were barely acceptable, and that the Capital Grille would have been a much better choice. We dine out several times a week, and will not return to Fleming's, nor will we recommend it.
March 7, 2015|Another Great Birthday DInner|5|My daughter requested dinner at Fleming's for her 15th birthday dinner. As usual, Fleming's did an excellent job of recognizing her birthday and treating her extra special. The French onion soup was fabulous and the steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were great. The new flavoring on the double-cut fries is great! Thanks for making her birthday memorable!
January 30, 2015|5 star food/drinks, 4 star service, 3 star hostess|4|"Outstanding food, unbelievable wine list, and perfect cocktails! The service was very good overall and the atmosphere was nice (especially the bar area). As others have mentioned it's a bit loud, certainly not unbearable but warrants the attention of management to do something about the acoustics. Our service was great for the first part of the meal but then was not so great after the main course. The wait for dessert was loooooooooong. It almost felt as though our server had forgotten about us even though there were several empty tables in our area of the restaurant and they didn't seem that busy. Another slight mistep was the hostess and her failure to acknowledge us on our way out. She was too busy laughing with a coworker to even say goodbye or ""thanks for coming."" Overall, a 4 star experience. We will dininitely return in the near future."
January 28, 2015|Not worth the aggrevation|1|"Was going to a 8pm concert at the Dunkin Donuts center, so we made a 6:30 reservation. We got there at 6 and checked in with the hostess who said they were running RIGHT ON TIME. When were weren't seated by 6:45, I checked in with the hostess who said they did not have any tables available and people were not leaving as they were likely going to the concert as well. Given that our concert started at 8, we were a bit nervous when 7pm rolled around and we still were not seated! I checked with the manager, who informed me that ""open table"" had double booked them with reservations and there was a snow storm so they didn't manage it. One would think they run into this situation all the time since 1) they are across from the Dunkin donuts center and 2) the Dunkin Donuts center has events all the time. If they had told me when I arrived they were running and hour late, I would have gone somewhere else! Won't be going here again."
January 23, 2015|Flemings Providence|5|Exceptional service! Server acknowledge me by last name as I had made an Open Table reservation which makes it a truly personal experience.
January 23, 2015|Best steakhouse I've ever been to!|5|We had Edgar as our waiter and he did not disappoint. Attentive and very knowledgable. Went above and beyond providing us an excellent meal!! My wife was allergic to set rain food and they made sure everything served was suitable and to her liking. His service is the reason why I would most definitely return to Flemings!! Amazing good!! Had the filet mignon. Wow!! And their blood orange sangria. One of the best I've tried honestly!!! Must try!!
January 21, 2015|Great fillet|4|I took my daughter here during Providence Restaurant week. I've been here before and it's a great steakhouse. We both ordered the twin fillets and they were great. The server suggested the molten lava cake which was not included in the Restaurant week menu and he did inform us of this. However when I got the bill it was a $13.50 charge. It was awesome but not worth $13.50! Lesson learned. Valet parking is now $9 per car. I missed that when I arrived as well and we had 2 cars! We paid $18 for an hour and a half parking. Never again. I'll park at the mall and walk across the skybridge! Both of those are my fault for missing the information or not asking but be careful.
January 17, 2015|Not great|3|We went during restaurant week - maybe not the best choice to try a new place. We had a reservation for 9 pm but still waited 45 mins in a very crowded, noisy and cold entryway. Waiter was PHENOMINAL (attentive, friendly) but the food was not good. Tasteless, no seasoning. Presentation was awful - 2 tiny fillets swimming around on a large plate. I was so disappointed.
January 17, 2015|Amazing all around|5|We started at the bar where the bartender introduced himself and everything continued on great. From the drinks to the apps, to the waiter and entrees. I had one of the most pleasant dining experiences ever.
January 17, 2015|Amazing food and service|5|The food was outstanding, and our waiter was very friendly. We dined with our young son and the staff was very accommodating, bringing us a high chair upon arrival. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Blood orange sangria is a must try!!!
January 16, 2015|We went to Fleming's for my birthday and...|5|We went to Fleming's for my birthday and at the end of our dinner, our server brought me chocolate truffles, a card signed by the employees and a $25 gift card. I've never gotten anything like that before! The service was great! We partook in the Restaurant Week menu in which there were many choices, all of which were great! I will definitely be going back!
January 2, 2015|A Great Dinning Experience|5|A Great Dinning Experience; only disappointment was the $9.00 parking charge.
December 31, 2014|No VO?|3|Looking forward to a nice manhattan with dinner. But a 5:15 on New Year's Eve you ran out???
December 31, 2014|Over priced|2|Over priced for average food at best. Service was more like being at a diner than a high end restaurant. I was very surprised by the quality of the food for the prices. Will not be back.
December 27, 2014|5star restaurant|5|A must go to steak place if you are in Providence. Everything is 5 Star
December 24, 2014|Nice Time|5|From food to service, everything was on point, although steak prices averaging in the mid 50's without sides is getting very expensive for the average family. Only a special occasion for me.
December 20, 2014|Delicious wine, amazing food, SUPERB service!|5|Saturday was my boyfriends birthday and I really wanted a special night. From the moment we walked in to the time we left it was just that, so special. We were welcomed by a friendly host staff everyone of them smiling and wished him a happy birthday. After being sat, we were greeted immediately by Edgar, so fast that another server welcomed us because she was nervous that no one had! I told her it was absolutey okay, better than being ignored! Edgar was so knowledgable of the wine list and recommended an amazing bottle to go with our steaks. Even after he was sat with a party of 16+ he was very attentive and made us feel like we were his only table. The sweet and spicy calamari, my filet, his ribeye, the CHOCOLATE lava cake and two bottles of wine later, it was a to die for experience. Just superb!
December 19, 2014|Delicious Special Occasion Dinner|5|We visited Fleming's for the first time for a Christmas-season date night. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was upscale but not snooty, and the service was fantastic! It was pricey but appropriate for a special occasion.
December 14, 2014|A Very Happy Birthday Dinner!|5|"This was our fourth time visiting Fleming's and it was awesome. My husband had the Sunday night prime rib special which was an amazing steal at $39.99. I had some French onion soup and a small plate of sliced filet mignon over risotto which was to die for. The service was great, if not a bit ""too attentive"" at times. We will definitely be going back."
December 14, 2014|Ambiance, Food and Service|5|I truly enjoy the ambiance of Fleming's. The food is unbelievable and the service is top notch! This is a great establishment for high end dining. Worth every dollar.
December 8, 2014|Solid|4|Can't go wrong here. Good date night spot and the steaks are always perfect. Price is up there.. but you get what you pay for. We'll be back.
December 6, 2014|Really enjoyed the evening|5|The staff does an excellent job of focussing on the care and well being of customers. Excellent job.
November 28, 2014|Great Dinner!|5|We had a great dinner: Good filet mignon and scallops. I would say the portions are reasonable sized and the food is expertly prepared. It was a special occasion which was noted on the reservation and the birthday boy had a nice card on the table and left with a small gift.
November 22, 2014|A grem|4|This review is for Boston there was a mistake in reservation.
November 8, 2014|out of stock !!|3|ran out of lobster at 6pm on a Saturday night did not stock Apple Pucker to make Apple Martini
November 2, 2014|Excellent dinner for two.|5|We had been to another Fleming's steakhouse a few years ago in New England and were not too impressed. We decided to give our closest Fleming's a chance and we were very impressed. The food (baked brie, clam chowder, wet aged [since the restaurant was out of dry aged] ribeye and tenderloin) was excellent (the fries were a little dark but tasted good) paired with a Washington State Cabernet and service all were absolutely outstanding. We will certainly return to Fleming's Steakhouse in Providence.
October 30, 2014|Prime rib value|5|DW and I both had $29.95 prime rib special fantastic value. Third time we've gone for this. Included is choice of creative tasty salads, large piece of tender rib cooked as ordered, choice from full menu of delicious side and scrumptious dessert. Service timely but not intrusive, sound advice offered. Prime rib special offered from time to time - don't miss it. Even at regular Sunday #39.95 is a great meal at a good price. Very good selection of wine by the glass, $8.50 and up.
October 25, 2014|Rediculously expensive.|2|The dining room was extremely loud. Steak was cold. Shrimp cocktail was on the menu as colossal, not even close and $18.50 for 4 small shrimp is rediculous. $220. for dinner!!!!! 2 people, 2 draft beers, 2 glasses of house wine.
October 24, 2014|Deconstructed porterhouse special unavai...|4|Deconstructed porterhouse special unavailable but waiter offered very suitable substitution. Nicely presented in a cast iron pan and served at the table, complete with delicious cauliflower and carrots as well as roasted potatoes. Definitely a good deal.
Dined on October 21, 2014|service was inattentive and not professi...|3|service was inattentive and not professional. the waitress did not know any of the wines. we had to wait to find out that they didn't have one. they forgot one side but it took a while to tell them that as they didn't come by after the food was served. they also forgot to ask us what sauces and we had to wait to get those once we could get someones attention. meat was very good but expensive
October 18, 2014|never a bad meal|5|always return to flemings with my family and never had a bad meal! love the warmth and coziness of this place
October 16, 2014|Consistent|5|Reliable menu replicated with great consistency and delivered with smooth service
October 10, 2014|Service lacked|3|Disappointed in a restaurant of this calibre and the service. Slow. When wedge came the lettuce was brown. No real reaction to our request to get it replaced. They replaced it with no quarrel but no words exchanged for an apology for it happening at all. Why bring it when it looks like that?
September 27, 2014|Fantastic|5|The steak/food is always great at Flemings. Sign up for their emails, we had a 3 course lobster/filet dinner for $44. Only offered if you mention the email...What a deal! Service was top notch!
September 27, 2014|Only negative is that it's outrageously ...|3|Only negative is that it's outrageously expensive!
September 27, 2014|awesome|5|One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time - made us feel special but not awkward about it. Customers for life now.
September 26, 2014|Always fantastic!|5|A great dining experience starts with great service and Flemings never disappoints me. The service from the time of arrival to the end of our meal was fantastic. The food as always was excellent and the overall experience left my wife and I talking for days. In Providence Flemings is a must for dinner.
September 22, 2014|Outstanding overall|4|This was a very good time.The service of the staff was obove normal.Our server Matt was very good at what he does.Knowledgeable of the menu and wine list.I say this is good for special occasions(this was our anniversary)for the reason that I feel it was a little too pricey.One day we will return on another special occasions.
September 19, 2014|Wonderful!|5|Our experience at Flemmings was wonderful. Quiet booth. Attentive service. EXCELLENT food. What more can one ask for in a dining experience?!
September 19, 2014|Wine Pairing Meal|4|Wine was fantastic (Duckhorn). Food pairing was tasty. However, 4 out of the five entrees that came were either cold or warm. Did seem like the kitchen was prepared for a group of 20.
September 13, 2014|I would especially like to comment on th...|5|I would especially like to comment on the wine list. It was exceptional! It was difficult to choose our favorite Cabernets as they were all listed. We finally agreed on the Round Pond and we were not disappointed. We would love to return but we live in NYC and Providence is a little out of the way or our romantic friday nights. Thanks for a fabulous weekend at the Omni.
September 4, 2014|Birthday celebration at Flemings|5|Went to Fleming's to celebrate a birthday. I wanted a great steak and decided to try Fleming's for the first time. Well I was not disappointed. I had the best steak ever. Great ambiance-perfect for a steakhouse.
September 1, 2014|Place2b|5|Steaks were cooked perfect!!! Well seasoned,melt in your mouth cuts of beef. Serves was outstanding and very nice wine selection.. Highly recommend to any who loves a good steak!
August 31, 2014|Always a great choice.|5|Flemings is by far my favorite restaurant in Providence. The food and service are exceptional, the wine list is notable and a trip to Flemings is always a memorable evening. There three course prime rib dinner is a favorite.
August 30, 2014|Perfection|5|Always and we hope forever, wonderful service and great food.
August 30, 2014|Long awaited dining|2|Bar is excellent. Good bar tenders, excellent service and the home made potato chips are excellent. Bread stinks, all with cheese and garlic. I like plain bread, French, Italian, etc. They have none, it's too much work according to waitress. Steak was over salted and needed to be sent back. Very thin for a rib eye. Bone-in is a joke because they cut it mostly away from the bone before cooking and it lost all the flavor. I did not appreciate the fruit fly frozen to the beer glass. Not properly cleaned and drained I would guess. Offered a gift certificate for another visit and refused it. Would not go back. Fruit flies are an indicator that the condiments are not properly kept. What else is wrong?????
August 28, 2014|Terrible Service|1|This was our second visit. First time we thought both food and service great. This time food was great. But if service was any slower would still be there waiting for appetizer. And they combined glacial pace with arrogance. Will never return.
August 26, 2014|Over hyped|3|"I have to say I was disappointed with the value of the restaurant. I would rate it well below The Capital Grill and Mortons as far as the ""food for the money"" goes."
August 23, 2014|Consistently outstanding|5|"We have been to Flemings about 8-10 times over the years that it has been open in Providence. Our primary waiter this time was ""William"" who informed us he is normally based in Miami but I am glad he was on temporary assignment serving us. He was personable, friendly, knowledgeable and had just the right touch of being there without hovering. The food was outstanding. My wife had the Fleming salad, salmon and asparagus and raved about it. I had the petite fillet and loaded potato as well as the ""new"" wedge salad which was a little smaller than I recall the old one being but more than adequate and very tasty. The fillet was up to Flemings usual high standards. Consistency, mark of a champion."
August 22, 2014|We enjoyed a filet and ribeye steak and ...|5|We enjoyed a filet and ribeye steak and both would melt in your mouth. Ours side dishes were good and the service was outstanding. We look forward to our next visit at Fleming's.
August 16, 2014|Best in Providence!|5|There are several great restaurants in Providence, but nobody has the service that Fleming's offers. You are made to feel welcome from when you arrive until your departure. Best steak in town, better than that Capital chain and the service is much better than Capital. Outstanding wine list, almost too many selections. They have some great bottles of wine but also offer many good wines at reasonable prices. The steak is cooked to perfection. They offer other dinners including fish but I chose to order steak at a steakhouse. I can usually find something to complain about or that needs improving but I have no complaints about Fleming's. All I can say is OUTSTANDING!
August 13, 2014|Another Celebration Success|5|"We just had another dinner at Flemings and again it was fantastic. Flemings is the place to go to celebrate that special day! We were greeted promptly, the service was fantastic and the food was spot on. Try the ""ROASTED MUSHROOM RAVIOLI"" Portobello and Shiitake mushrooms, Porcini butter sauce YUM!!! SWEET CHILE CALAMARI is the kids favorite."
August 9, 2014|enjoyable dinner|3|we had a wonderful meal. food was delicious. couple of mix ups with cocktails and special request food. but overall good experience.
August 2, 2014|Wonderful|5|It was a wonderful nite. It was my boyfriends birthday and we went there as it was attached to the Omni hotel. The staff called us by name and I told the hostess it was his birthday and he had a card for him. The dinner was great, the check came with a box of truffles and a $25 gift card! The manager came and spoke with us to thank us for coming and checking on how our meal was!
August 1, 2014|Phenomenal|5|Once again, it must be noted that the food and service at the Providence Fleming's Restaurant are quite simply phenomenal. Every waitstaff person as well as the manager frequent tables to check on the diners' experience and satisfaction. It is always a celebration of enjoyment at Fleming's.
July 26, 2014|Great as usual|5|Steaks cooked to perfection . It's very consistent here which is tough to find . Best carrot cake around just typing this makes me crave it .
July 20, 2014|Perfection|5|All the food and service up to a par for enjoyment
July 19, 2014|Don't eat here!|1|Overall bad experience. Waitress dropped food. Waiter didn't no menu special and even when we showed him what the menu said, he argued. He finally reluctantly agreed to honor menu, then charged me extra anyway. When we asked to see manager, she also tried to explain away the mistake. I finally flat out asked if she would just fix the bill and she blabbered on. I would never ever eat there again. Ever.
July 19, 2014|Won't be back!|3|this was our second visit, this time for restaurant week..disappointing, wont go back..rather go to Capitol grill..the bread was cold..didnt get our bread and water , had to ask..my husbands salad was so small..and no dressing to speak of..his lobster mac and cheese, must have had the lobster walk by the pan..none to be found..my steaks were ok..dessert was good ...waste of a dinner out..
July 18, 2014|very nice|5|This place is recommendable. The service was nice and flexible and met our excepctation at any time to our fullest content. the filet mingon was delicious. The price is upper-range, but the service is not uptight what it got our sympathy
July 18, 2014|Great food|3|Terrible service (almost everything for every course came out wrong, had to wait 20 minutes to get menus??) followed by an entirely flippant attitude from the manager
July 18, 2014|Place looks great inside. Went for resta...|3|Place looks great inside. Went for restaurant week to try it out. Great selection compared to other restaurants. Chowder however was excellent. Fillet mignons were average. We had 5 of them and they were all not cooked correctly. Creme Brule was excellent. Service was below average and not even close to most upscale places in the area. They could take a tip from Ruth Chris next door. We had to ask multiple times for a beer bottle of wine and bread. Generally when u get a bottle of wine the waitress would pour a drop to see if it's ok. Ours just poured in our glasses before sampling. I would recommend Ruth Chris and Capital Grille over this restaurant. Overall not bad just not as good as some of the other places right next door.
July 14, 2014|Had a great time|4|My girlfriend and I had a lovely dinner at Flemings on Monday night. The only reason for the 4 stars on the food was because my salmon was alittle under cooked. But the rest of the food was delicious!! The blond manager that walked around was great! Very accommodating. Overall we had a nice time
July 13, 2014|Great food and good atmosphere|4|I had my birthday dinner at Fleming's, I like the quiet atmosphere and the great food. The clam chowder was excellent and so are the steaks. We are a party of six and everyone enjoy their meal.
July 12, 2014|Friendly|5|I usually go to this restaurant on special occasions. They always have picked up on why we were celebrating, and personalize the service. Thank God they don't sing happy birthday but they do recognize the celebrant with card etc. Perfect restaurant perfect night
July 12, 2014|good food but high prices|3|We visited Fleming's for Providence restaurant week. It was a good value for this visit. The food wss typical upscale steak house chain food. While well prepared, it was not outstanding. I would not go back to the restaurant for a night out at regular menu prices.
July 12, 2014|One of the best|5|Providence has so many wonderful restaurants but I most admit that Fleming's is one of my favorite. The service is outstanding, the menu selection is varied and the food is delicious. Dinning at Fleming's is always a wonderful experience.
July 12, 2014|Wouldnt recommend unless no choice|2|The mushroom ravioli was the best we have ever tasted!!!!! Not one of the four pieces of meat we had was cooked right (two plates of duo filet mignon)... all overcooked! My girlfriend's plate was cleared before I was done (a minute or two after) and my plate was cleared while still chewing on food. Didnt have time to finish my glass of wine (not even a sip after finish eating) that desert was on the table!... it felt like they were pushing us out and it wasnt even 8!! Overall, i wouldnt suggest this restaurant to anyone unless you dont have a choice and just wanna get something in your stomach... so many good restaurants to choose from in Providence!
July 12, 2014|Nice Evening|4|We booked Fleming's because we were in the mood for a good steak, and it was Providence Restaurant Week, so it was more affordable for our budget. The service was fantastic, and the food was awesome too. We both had the filet mignon. I needed a no dairy option so they nicely substituted sauteed spinach for creamed spinach, and a baked potato for the mashed. Much appreciated! Our waiter was so nice about it.We would happily go back to Fleming's.
Dined on July 9, 2014|WINE and food|5|"There are about 100 different wines on the ""by the glass"" list and they are a well chosen mix of the known and the obscure. The most experienced wine consumer will find something they have never tried. And the menu has enough variety to ensure that you can find well prepared food to go with your choices of wine."
July 8, 2014|Great meal, great service!|5|My friends and I had dinner at Flemings during restaurant week. We were staying in the Omni & wanted to eat in the hotel & didn't know we were going to be getting such a great deal. Between the three of us we tried the Caesar salad, Mushroom Ravioli, twin filet mignon's, lobster Mac & Cheese, V Creme Brûlée, Lava Cake, & Cheesecake. Every item was perfectly prepared and the service was flawless. We will return again the next time we are in town. This is a place not to be missed!
July 7, 2014|Again delightful!|5|"We cannot say it enough times how consistently delicious and welcoming Fleming's of Providence is to its dining guests. Accommodations are always made so that dietary needs are met even during restaurant week when it is busier than usual. My husband and I are thrilled to be there due to the kindnesses of the entire waitstaff and manager. The filet mignon and the prime rib are truly ""out of this world"" especially when accompanied by the phenomenal onion rings, garlic potatoes and sautéed spinach. The walnut turtle pie is a chocolate lovers' dream!"

July 6, 2014|Great dinner|5|my Husband and I go to Flemings in Providence at least once a month. We love the food and the atmosphere. The help is exceptional as is the service.
July 4, 2014|Not the best meal|3|Fleming's has always been my favorite steakhouse in Providence, however this last visit was very disappointing. I had the swordfish, it had an odd sauce on it and came with couscous. Overall it was okay, it was a very small portion and didn't have much flavor. It certainly was not worth $32. My husband ordered a sirloin steak, it was good. Just not a spectacular meal for the money, the bill came to around $160 with tip. We each had one drink and each ordered a side. The sides were mashed peppercorn parmesan potatoes and grilled asparagus, we enjoyed them both. There are too many great restaurants in the area to return to this one.
July 1, 2014|Very pricey|3|"We split some special priced apps -- which were a good deal - but I feel that we really got cheated on our wine bill. We were at the bar & each had 2 ""tall"" pours of wine - which came out more than the price of the bottle - and staff did not attempt to give us the lower price. Expensive for what you get"
June 29, 2014|Incompetent kitchen|1|I ordered a filet medium. The first steak was so overdone that it looked and tasted like pot roast. They took that away and returned with a steak that was extremely rare. Couldn't eat it- left hungry. The kitchen staff can't get it right which explains why they had an empty dining room on a weekend night in June. They have an open kitchen concept and we could see the servers eating food. Valet parking is reduced to $9 if the restaurant validates your ticket. Save your money and go to one of the better steakhouses in Providence.
June 28, 2014|Unexpected!|4|I took my son out for a special dinner, fully expecting to spend a lot on a great steak dinner. He told the waiter he wanted to start with the tuna tartar. The waiter (a really nice guy) said it was part of a three course special dinner, but he could order just the appetizer from that menu if he wished. We quickly decided to just order the three course deal. And WOW, for about $40 each we had the app. a serf and turf of petite filet (cooked perfect) and the best salmon I may have ever had. Plus a small desert. Great deal, great place.
June 28, 2014|We had a very nice dinner and the food w...|5|We had a very nice dinner and the food was delicious. We would definitely go again and recommend it to all of our friends. The only suggestion is from the street side, I would put signs up directing your guests. When we tried to find the place there were several other people outside trying to find the entrance. Thank you
June 12, 2014|Always the best!|5|"There are no words for the Providence, RI Fleming's other than ""consistently fantastic."" That description applies to the ambiance, cleanliness, food, hosting staff/waitstaff, and management. Our most current experience again solidifies our feelings about dining here. Armani and his assistant, and as always Manager Rachel offered treatment that equates to a level of ""royalty!"" We leave each experience with a positive feeling as well as special memories of a delicious and satisfying evening."
June 7, 2014|A Gem|5|This was the first time my son and I had ever been to a Flemings, although my husband has been to others around the country. The food was fantastic. We had a wonderful bottle of wine from a vast selection of great wines. The French onion soup was phenomenal as was the chocolate desert and of course the Filet Mignon was fantastic. The garlic mashed potatoes were the best I ever had and the grilled asparagus was perfect. We will definitely be coming back and hopefully bringing friends and family. Love this place. So glad I tried it.
June 6, 2014|Excellent steak house|5|From wines to desert and steaks in between, a great relaxing place to enjoy good food at leisure. Great to have a thank you from a restaurant for dining as unexpected in todays world.
June 6, 2014|super steak & wine pairing|5|We continue to return to Flemings because of the high level of service, perfectly cooked steak, and extensive wine cellar. Favorite in RI.
May 31, 2014|unbelievable|4|The best piece of meat I have ever had! I didnt know steak could taste sooo good.
May 28, 2014|a great dinner|4|we enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere...
May 25, 2014|what a great service|5|We booked this restaurant for our son's graduation party. The private room was absolutely perfect and the service could not have been better. They made our special day even more special. Thank you!
May 25, 2014|FIrst Time Won't be My Last|5|At long last we got to dine at Fleming's in Providence RI. To say this was out of this world is an understatement. I have to say that the food was fantastic and the service was especially wonderful (thank you Stephanie). Last year we dined at Ruth Chris's in Providence, and IMHO Flemings out shines Ruth Chris's in all aspects of fine dining. Service was better and the steak I had was superb.
May 24, 2014|Saturday Night Out!|5|Once again we went to Flemings for a can't miss Saturday night out on the town. My wife had a craving for crab legs and we were off. The Prime rib was excellent and the experience another 10 out of 10.
May 17, 2014|Treated very well|5|We went there for out wedding anniversary which I mentioned in our reservation for the purpose of requesting a quiet table. We were treated so well. Everyone wished us a happy anniversary and we received a card and gift, I even received a thank you e mail this morning from the restaurant. The food was excellent and the staff very attentive.
May 11, 2014|Steakhouse|5|Ithink it is the best Steakhouse in Rhode Island. Food and Srevice is always Top Notch My Appertizer of Braised Pork Belly was superb, and as usual the Steaks, this time Rib Eyes were outstanding, well marbled and perfectly cooked. Only complaint was the $9.00 Valet Fee Detracts from a Class Establishment
May 11, 2014|Poor standards, low class|1|"During dinner on Mother's Day, a man walked in, wearing a gray t-shirt with the 'F' word in large, green, capital, bold letters across the front of it. I told the manager that I was shocked that Fleming's had no problem with such an offensive shirt, particularly on Mother's Day. As he began to act as if he didn't know what I was talking about, he turned and looked directly at the man wearing the shirt so obviously he had seen him come in. I told the manager that ""even Six Flags"" prohibits t-shirts such as that one, and that I was shocked to learn that Fleming's had lower standards than a Six Flags amusement park. The manager acted completely clueless. If you're looking for class, look elsewhere. I'll stick to the Capital Grille from now on."

May 10, 2014|Great for pre-Philharmonic|5|We intrepidly tried Flemings for before the Philharmonic performance, because we do not like chains. This was a very pleasant surprise as it doesn't seem like a chain in any way. The food was really good, the service was exceptional. And I mentioned that it was my birthday, but nothing big, and every waiter in the place (it seemed) came by my table to wish me a happy birthday, but no singing, thank goodness. And the waiter was so helpful to us in selecting wine and beer, the dessert (creme brulee) was a delight. Overall, a most pleasant experience.
May 3, 2014|After a matinee |5|After an early showing of Book of Mormon, we went to Fleming's for dinner. I know Fleming's is a chain but you would never know once inside. The staff is extremely friendly, we asked for Ken, who we had met previously there and as usual he was most cordial. We enjoyed a very relaxing dinner and as always felt quite at home. It in downtown Providence where much of the action is and the area is safe and close to everything. A bit more costly then some establishments but well worth the expense. Valet parking is available which is wonderful. I highly recommend Fleming's Steakhouse for any occasion. NOTE: They also do a wonderful Ken Tasting on occasion, try it.
April 26, 2014|Again|4|We often go her when it rains to utilize the Valet and entryway at the former Westin. The King Crab legs where plentiful and great while we also had the Spring Menu Special Filet. JP
April 20, 2014|Fantastic Easter Brunch|4|Everything was great from the moment we parked the car until it was time to leave. However, a validation stamp did not take care of the $9 parking fee but as we left the waiter gave us a $20 gift card as appreciation for giving them the business on Easter. Food was great but the choices in the pre-fixe brunch menu were limited.
April 20, 2014|A STEAKHOUSE SERVING BRUNCH?|5|$35.95 per person from appetizer to dessert, 3 choices for each course.Let me thank our waiter, Edgar Viloria - he made suggestions (all were spot on) and was extremely attentive. My husband and I both began with the Lobster Bisque, it was excellent. I had a house Mimosa with passion fruit made on the premise; my husband chose the Bacon & Bleu Cheese Bloody Mary-AMAZING! Entrees were Blueberry Brioche French Toast with homemade blueberry sauce AND homemade breakfast sausuage links and prime rib. Dessert was cheesecake for both. All in all, Flemings was amazing and a great value too! We will be going back.
April 19, 2014|Very enjoyable|5|Our server Matt was outstanding. Food was excellent.
April 18, 2014|Excellent |5|Excellent food choice and excellent professional service!
April 18, 2014|Fine food, service, quiet for a special ...|5|Fine food, service, quiet for a special occasion. Service attentive and pleasant. Quality steak, delicious baked potato with trimmings and good house salad to start. Had nice evening with our 12 year old grandson who now enjoys a delicious steak. Will be back at one of your locations.
April 18, 2014|Great experience|5|The service was fantastic and they made it a very special birthday experience for my father! Great food, great wine suggestions and great atmosphere!
April 2, 2014|Excellent steak|5|Fleming's is one of my favorite steakhouses in Providence. The food is always excellent and the service is top notch. This is one of the only 3 steakhouses in Providence that serve Prime cut....Ruth's Chris and Prime on Atwells are the other two. My steak (medium rare) was so tender and flavorful, it was outstanding. This was my third steak meal this week and it was by far the best of all. I took some of the white goat cheese butter that came with the bread and spread it on my steak...it was just so good !!! Yummy. Can't wait to go back. My waiter Terry was attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant. Excellent food, excellent service.
March 30, 2014|Stellar Again|4|The staff at Fleming's does not disappoint and we really appreciate what is becoming the lost art of fine dining service. The Friends of Flemings special offers cannot be beaten. Filet & Lobster tail with salad and dessert for $39.95. Tremendous!
March 29, 2014|Accommodating staff. Great|3|Accommodating staff. Great location. Solid atmosphere. Food was good but clearly not he best steak house in Providence. Expensive for what you got in quality.
March 29, 2014|One of the Best|5|First time at Fleming's and it certainly will not be my last. Food was superb as was the service.
March 17, 2014|Great Service|5|Great service and food. Always a great spot for a special occasion.
March 16, 2014|Continued Excellence|4|Had dinner for what was perhaps my tenth visit to this Fleming's location. The service is always excellent and waiter, Edgar, did not disappoint.
March 15, 2014|The service was very persoanble..I|4|"The service was very persoanble..I am in the customer service industry, so I know what type of personality is suited to this profession.. ..they have a knack of engaging theirs patrons; very well done. The food is excellent..it is pricey, no doubt, but the crowded rooms are evidence that patrons are not concerned by the price. e would return , but not for awhile..we usually eat Italian and closer to home, in southern RI..but we do enjoy the ""big city"" ambiance occasionally."
March 14, 2014|Night out|5|Date night with my husband, with three kids, having a meal I didn't have to prepare is huge. WE started off with the Seafood Tower for the appetizer, delicious, followed by the wedge salad, and for my entree I had Halibut my husband had swordfish, great gluten free menu, my husband has celiac. Finished with a cappuccino, the waiter was excellent, one of my all time favorite restaurants, I usually have the fillet, but being in lent, we only had fish. Excellent, cant wait to go back!!
Dined on March 13, 2014|Fantastic Specials|1|Fleming's manages to make their menu affordable to middle class patrons such as my self, who love great food but can't afford to dine at venues like this often. They promote very attractive specials.
March 8, 2014|Great night out|5|Best waiter we have ever had at Flemings. He made the night complete. His knowledge of the menu and wine list was awesome .
March 8, 2014|decent but overpriced|2|food was tasty but for what you pay, it should wow you. if you want great steak, there are other places to go that won't empty your wallet.
March 7, 2014|"Excellent food!
The wine and"|5|Excellent food! The wine and dessert menu is on an ipad, very cute. The food was great and the ambiance of the whole place was perfect.
March 7, 2014|Pefection|5|It's not often enough that a restaurant exceeds the mark on food, service and atmosphere but Fleming's in Providence was so outstanding I feel passionate about writing this review. From the moment we arrived, everything was perfect. The wait staff was so attentive, respectful and knowledgeable but wait there's more! Our servers actually anticipated our every need. The wine selection was outstanding and the food was cooked to perfection. All was done with just the right timing. I was so impressed. Bravo Fleming's! We will be back again and again
March 1, 2014|A wonderful place to meet friends or a c...|5|A wonderful place to meet friends or a causal drink or for dinner. Wide choice of beverage and meal selection, the staff from the front desk to the bus people are all on key with the restaurants appeal. It is a bit pricey but the quality and atmosphere more than make up for the cost. Highly recommend and can't wait for a return visit.
February 22, 2014|Exquisite in all directions|5|Cynthia was our server and she was phenomenal. Her supporting staff was helpful as well. The food was excellent from our appetizer to our dessert. This is my new favorite place!
February 17, 2014|A Perfect Experience Again & Again|5|Our dining visit to Flemings was perfect in every way once again. The cranberry walnut salad was large enough for us to share. The prime rib was served with a trio of sauces to enrich the already excellent meat cut. The tower of scrumptious fried onion rings were the best ever! My petite plate of sliced filet mignon on a bed of sautéed spinach (rather than the risotto) was also tasty and tender, and just enough for me. And then, dessert -a hefty slice of walnut turtle pie consisting of smooth chocolate and huge walnuts - absolutely the richest of rich!
February 16, 2014|Very happy diners!|5|Dinner was excellent! The food and drinks (wine and specialty cocktails) were amazing. Our server, Danielle, was awesome and extremely accomodating to our needs. My only negative things would be that (1) we had a reservation and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready and (2) when my meal arrived I was supposed to get drawn butter with my lobster tail which didn't come so by the time it did, the lobster tail was cold. Still overall the experience was very pleasant and we would go back in a second.
February 15, 2014|Food was good but|3|We had a decent experience at Flemings although it is definitely and overpriced steak.
February 14, 2014|valentines day|5|this was my first time here, and i loved it. i should have made reservation a week Earlie. the waitress nick was great cause we had a lot of questions about the menu and drinks and he explained everything to us. the sourdough bread was great with two different butters on each side that i never tasted in my life. i was very pleased with the steak it was juicy tender and flavorful. i will be returning again this place is great.
February 14, 2014|Premium price not premium food|2|Highest bill I ever got for dinner which would be ok if it was the best food I ever had. It was not even close. Food presentation was very poor and flavor profiles from the calimari being over salted to my 48.00 dollar filet mignon to being just plain boring. I never have had such buyers remorse over food before. I had two baked potatoes that came to over twenty dollars REALLY c'mon . Cannot recommend this place to any one
February 14, 2014|Parking problem|3|While the food is quite good, the parking situation at this restaurant is impossible. In contrast to many equally good restaurants in downtown Providence, one is obliged to use expensive valet parking. There is always major traffic congestion at this place, which is shared with the entrance to a large hotel. It always takes a long time, at least 15-20 minutes in my experience, to retrieve one's car. Alternative parking is far away. This has limited our willingness to eat here.
February 14, 2014|Wonderful Experience|5|My wife and I went to Flemmings for the first time on Valentine's Day. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, the experience was perfect. The staff was professional and personable, not stiff and plastic like at some fancy restaurants. And the food...outstanding! We savored every bite from the bread with the flavored butters to the main course (steaks, of course). Our only regret was that we didn't order dessert...we were too full. If you are looking for a place to have a dinner with a special someone and are willing to pay extra for perfectly prepared food and attentive service, then consider making the trip to Flemmmings in Providence.
February 14, 2014|Great food, great service!|5|From the moment you walk in, to the moment you walk out, the service is impeccable. The filet is second to none and the wine list is very impressive. Some places are just over priced, Flemming's Providence is worth every penny. A+
February 14, 2014|Great ambience and food, but...|4|We were seated in a lovely room with fantastic lighting and decor. The waitstaff was very attentive, however, they were a bit too attentive. We were interrupted several times, including as I was actually eating my bread! The waiter took my break plate while I was still holding the bread and chewing so he could clean the table. He then gave me back the bread plate. A bit odd if you ask me.
February 14, 2014|one good restaurant|5|after looking at ther reviews for flemings my gf and i were please with the food and service, flemings is on my list of gd steakhouses, we r going back again
February 12, 2014|we celebrated valentines with|5|we celebrated valentines with my daughter and her roommate the staff was very accommodating and the food was exceptional
February 8, 2014|Saturday night- Fine Dining|4|Fleming's in Providence is much better than a typical high end hotel restaurant and deserves recognition for being a complete fine dining experience. The ambience, food and service make it an excellent choice.
February 2, 2014|another great night at Flemings|5|We went for the Prime Rib special, it was another great evening, food, service were top notch. We both had the Prime Rib special and were surprised at the most generous portion, salads were spectacular as were the two desserts. Highly recommend
February 1, 2014|Cigar room still smells like|3|Cigar room still smells like cigars. It's been years. Cold by window. New menu eliminates shoestring fries which were terrific. Ribeye steak very little flavor? Yet price over $50. Disappointing overall especially considering the price. Basically the menu and quality changes impact the customer experience negatively. And it used to be be excellent. I won't go back anytime soon.
February 1, 2014|Great|5|Celebrated my birthday here. Service and food were great and they delivered a birthday gift at the end of the meal. High cost for the meal and drinks but I knew what I was getting into.
February 1, 2014|Nice night out with the boys|4|I took my mother, son and his roommates out for dinner on Saturday night. After being seated in a back room that smelled like cigar smoke, I asked our waiter for a change of scenery and he promptly accomodated us. The food was delicious, the wine perfectly matched with my food selection, and our staff was friendly and attentive. We've been to Flemings before, and will return.
January 29, 2014|Steak in the best tradition|5|Great steaks comparable with the best quality and presentation/service in NYC. Server and her team were attentive without being intrusive.
January 27, 2014|Thank you for making my friend|5|Thank you for making my friend Joy's birthday dinner extra special - and we didn't even tell anyone it was her birthday! Our waiter, Nicholas must have seen the cards or overheard us talking about it. Smooth move... Everything about the evening was lovely and she so appreciated the birthday card from the staff, the truffles and of course, the gift card. Rachel the manager stopped by the table and was a marvelous host. We had a terrific evening and will be back soon.
January 26, 2014|My husband is a foodie, and|5|"My husband is a foodie, and almost impossible to get enough of a ""wow"" experience to make him really want to go back again. Having said that, he is already making plans for us to go out again to Fleming's soon. The food was phenomenal, our waiter was outstanding, and our overall experience was fantastic. There was an abundance of food to select from, and our waiter asked a few questions to try to figure out what to recommend. His recommendations were spot on. My husband has a face that he makes when he eats something that surpasses his expectations, and that face was made with each course we had. The food was cooked perfectly, the desserts were scrumptious. There really is nothing negative that I could say about this restaurant."
January 26, 2014|Royal treatment|5|"Went for the prime rib Sun./Mon. 29.95 special. There was no hint of lesser service because we were paying < 1/2 of a typical meal. Served like a prince; food fit for a king. ""Modern Caesar Salad"" good size, tasty and unique. Nice >queen size cut of meat cooked perfectly, with a tasty herbal rub. Choice of any side on the menu; we got grilled cippolini onions and grilled asparagus - delish. Then came the desert - awesome chocolate lava cake with 2 scoops of ice cream and unique wafer thin crisp chocolate chip cookies. Service was outstanding! Friendly, prompt, lots of special touches. Wife's martini arrived a little sweet but it was replaced with no more prompting than the statement, ""it's alright."""
January 25, 2014|Phenomenal|5|This restaurant has it all. The food is truly superior. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The atmosphere has quiet corners and larger areas off to the edges for larger groups, as well as a private room. We went two weeks in a row, once for Providence restaurant Week and then for their P rime Rib special night. Both nights the food was outstanding, with generous portions and a nice variety of options for the different courses. Highly recommend this restaurant. Can't wait to go back!
January 25, 2014|FABULOUS!|5|There are only the highest levels of positive compliments to give to Fleming's. Once again the food was fabulous as was the service. Cynthia our waitress was so pleasant, helpful, and precise in every way. And kudos to her assistant Bryson for his accuracy, attention, and his wonderful smile. Much of this must be attributed to Rachel, the manager, who once again checked in at our table to be assured that all was perfect. This was actually the second celebration this month for my husband's birthday, and everyone of these fen people let us feel that we were still very special.
January 25, 2014|First Time Visit|4|From the moment we arrived,everything was great..the girls at the front desk...our waitress......very helpful in helping us choose from the menu and the specials for the night..the food..the wine list (on a tablet!)the food was excellent!!! We will most likely visit again in the future.l Ioved the fact that when I made the reservation and made mention that we were celebrating our 36th anniversary,everyone from the girls at the front desk,our waitress Corrie and the Maitre d ' let us know taht this was a special night. Thank you so much!!!
January 25, 2014|Excellent|5|We decided to go here to celebrated our anniversary earlier since its the weekend. The moment we were seated the Staffs all wish us happy anniversary which made us felt special. We love Coming here and never disappointed. Food was Great and staff are very professional. Rachel the manage That might even stop by the table to check on us. At The end they gave us a box of chocolate for anniversary. All I Can said was we enjoyed it very much. Thanks.
January 23, 2014|An evening of pure pleasure|5|We had not been back to Fleming's in several years; fortunately Providence Restaurant Week attracted us back. We had a delightful dinning experience. The bread and the two appetizers, raviolis and chowder, started us off to a great meal. r The Filet Mignon's were perfectly cooked, the meat was tender and busting with flavor. The Lobster Mac was rich, with just the right amount of lobster meat and rich creamy cheese. The side dishes of mashed potatoes with blue cheese, had the amount of blue cheese and was a most unusual way of serving mashed potatoes, high recommend trying this. The cream spinach was creamy and oh so good. The truffles and cheesecake for desert were a perfect way to end an excellent meal. Their wine list is most impressive.
January 20, 2014|Great|5|Everything was wonderful. Chad the bar tender was great!
January 18, 2014|Not worth it|3|We went for providence restaurant week. We received 3 courses for 30. If it wasn't for that deal the prices are very high. When paying those prices I expect the best but instead got ok. My fiancé ordered twin filets. One of the filets was cooked perfectly but the other was overcooked. I ordered the lobster Mac n cheese. The taste of the Mac was good but you only get 3 small pieces of lobster and all 3 pieces were overcooked and rubbery. The two sides we had were creamed spinach (good) and mashed potatoes (awful for a high end restaurant ). They lacked any flavor. They ran out of one of the desserts we wanted also. There are about 5 high end steak houses within a couple miles of each other and this one does not stand out. I wouldn't go back
January 17, 2014|Wonderful Dining Experience|5|A pleasurable evening for us includes supper at a good restaurant where we can relax and enjoy good food. Flemings provides a charming atmosphere with excellent food and superb service. What a treat to be able to sit back and relax as we're pampered!
January 15, 2014|Good steaks and sides|4|Out of 5 of us, the food was cooked perfectly for four of us. One steak ordered med rate was med well. They did offer to take it back and gave my friend her drink fir free. Sides were delicious!
January 13, 2014|Resturant Week|5|Flemings this week was amazing! We went for resturant week and the food was delicious. The resturant week menu had great options and the wine list and the iPad you use to scan it is amazing. Dessert was some of the best creme brule I have ever had!! My only sorta complaint is that it was very cold, seemed like no matter where you were in the resturant there was a draft from the doors.
January 11, 2014|Restaurant week|5|Great second time experience at the restaurant! Service was outstanding ! Right from the greeting! To the bartender(that shaked our hands and introduced himself ) and waitstaff ! Even though it was restaurant week! We were treated just like any other day! Food was great also! Filet melted in your mouth!
January 11, 2014|Will go back.|4|Tried the restaurant as part of Restaurant week. Would definitely go back. Service, cocktails and food were all top rated.
January 11, 2014|Outstanding service|5|From the moment we walked in the door we felt well taken care of from the hostess to the wait staff you felt that you were a special guest.
Dined on January 5, 2014|Great dining experience|5|We made our first visit to Fleming's on Sunday, January 5th. We had an early reservation and the dining area was just opening when we arrived. The staff was wonderful, very attentive. The food was excellent and the portions were appropriate. We will definitely be returning for another visit!
January 1, 2014|We were attracted to go by|5|"We were attracted to go by the prime rib special - salad, prime rib, side order and dessert. The wedge salad was outstanding. Nice portion, a large chuck of blue cheese (in addition to the usual chucks), a whole slice of bacon (besides the usual crumbled bacon) and halved cherry/grape tomatoes. The prime rib was done to perfection and nice portion and the dessert chosen was ice cream (a little disappointing the choices were only vanilla or chocolate). Wife took her NY cheesecake to go. What made this special was server ""Thierry"" who was expectedly knowledgeable but was friendly and made some nice suggestions. Most importantly, he was there when needed (and anticipated our needs) with the perfect blend of available w/o hovering."
December 31, 2013|amazing food! perfect service!|5|but no windows! very expensive - everything a la carte,.
December 28, 2013|Great steaks|5|I went to Flemings after a play. The service, food, wine selection - all outstanding. My new favorite. I will definitely go back.
December 24, 2013|Quality Steak and Service.|5|Service was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the wine list and any menu questions. All the food was cooked to your liking and prepared well, and seasoned properly. The only thing is that you definitely need to know that you are going to pay for it. Steaks range from $45-55, and sides serve 2-3 people and are about $10 a piece. I Still highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion though!
December 23, 2013|Wonderful Experience|5|We are very please with our experience, we went on the 23rd for dinner. We had a wonderful time. The staff was incredible. Jeremy was our waiter and was a pleasure to have serve us. It was a nice way to start our crazy and hectic next few days. Well worth the price.
December 18, 2013|Excellent food|5|Great food before a show at the dunkin donut center, great location...perfect all around.
December 15, 2013|Surprised and delighted!|5|We enjoyed my husband's birthday dinner here a few nights ago. The restaurant is tucked into the Omni hotel (near the hotel's main entrance) so I would definitely suggest valeting your car at the Omni. When we entered, we were warmly greeted and then headed to the bar where we planned to have a pre-dinner cocktail. We had so much fun at the bar with both the bartender and other patrons that we stayed put, ordered another round of martinis and some appetizers too. We felt extremely welcome and comfortable in this restaurant and were delighted by the birthday card and small box of chocolates they gave to my birthday boy. We can't wait to come back! Next time, we'll even order some steak!
December 7, 2013|Disappointed with our visit|2|This was our first visit to Flemings which we had really been looking forward to. I thought well, this is pricey but, if the food was excellent, it would be worth it. Needless to say, we were very disappointed in the food. Regarding the food, My wife had the Petite Filet which was chewy and flavorless. Plus it was very obviously a cut toward the end of the tenderloin. I had the NY Strip boneless which was very tough. Both steaks were ordered medium and, though they were cooked correctly, the meat was below par. Flemings scalloped potatoes were luke warm. So, all in all the meal was very disappointing and we will not be back.
November 23, 2013|I have been here before and|2|I have been here before and it'a always been good my fish wasn't fresh potatoes were room temperature. it was mediocre and probably won't be back because it was so pricey. Food didn't match the price at all. Service was good though.
November 23, 2013|Great Food and Service|5|Excellent steaks, prepared to perfection. Extensive wine list, offered up on an iPad to properly match a meal with a wine. Waiter was very personable, his assistants did a good job backing him up. Server also gave suggestions, and thoroughly described the details of the specials. Pricey (as expected) but worth it for a special treat,.
November 9, 2013|Not worth the price!|2|"We had an 8:30 reservation for 5 on a busy Saturday evening. The ""little"" things that went wrong at your restaurant during our dining experience were a disgrace! My husband ordered a ""bottle"" of wine and we were brought 2 glasses then had to order 2 more during dinner. We had to ""ask"" for bread once dinner was served because it never arrived because ""we ran out""?? Then the topper that evening was the fact that in our dining room a ""bus girl"" was polishing glasses at a table in the middle of the room while another employee was sweeping under an ""unset"" table right next to another couple trying to enjoy their dinner. Overall a horrible experience!"
November 9, 2013|Memorable evening|5|The restaurant definitely lives up to its reputation for great steaks. My petit filet was fork tender and cooked to perfection. My companion's salmon was one of the best he's ever tasted. The side dishes were generous enough for two to share. The desserts were also generously portioned. The lava cake was chocolately rich and creamy. It paired well with the vanilla ice cream. The cheese cake was dense and finished with fresh berries. Both came with a dish of Chantilly cream. The service was attentive but unobtrusive. The waiter was pleasant, knowledgable and helpful. We were seated in the back room of the restaurant that remained pleasantly quiet even though it was filled to capacity, thus allowing for easy conversation.

November 2, 2013|Fantastic Experience!!|5|Went to the Omni Hotel in Providence for a weekend getaway with my wife. We decided to try the Flemings Steakhouse in the lobby of the Hotel. Reserved with Open Table and mentioned in the notes that I would be celebrating my Birthday. They actually presented me with a Birthday Card signed by the whole staff upon being seated! The filet mignon that we ordered was extremely tender and cooked exactly as we specified. The waitress and busboy were extremely attentive throughout the whole meal and made us feel like we were having dinner in our dining room at home. After dessert we were presented with delicious chocolate truffles and to my surprise a $25.00 Flemings gift card for a future visit! Would definitely go back based on the service alone.
October 26, 2013|Disappointed|2|Very disappointing. The ambience was nice but our waiter kept disappearing. The bus boy brought bread that was dried out and tasteless. We had to ask the bus boy to get us a glass of wine because our waiter couldn't be found. Once we signaled our waiter, we were able to order. We got our shrimp cocktail that was barely edible. It was so over cooked, dried out and hard. The minute we put that to the side, someone delivered our steak. The steak was very good and the potatoes were just ok. We were half way through our meal when the waiter finally showed up with out drink. When we wanted to leave, again we had to ask the busboy for our bill because the waiter had disappeared again. For the money you should go to Capital Grille. They do it right
October 24, 2013|A few Hits And A Miss|3|We sat at a table in the bar area because we wanted it to a relaxed night. There were some surprises...the little warm loaf of bread with feta spread was AMAZING, the plain salted potato off the sides menu was the best potato I have ever had (though it came out after we were almost done with our meal and really should have been taken off the check) and the wines by the glass list is probably the best of any spot. However, the beat salad (though very tasty) needed a few more beats-I found two tiny ones and the BBQ shrimp were totally overcooked and rubbery-yet my scallops were cooked perfectly. The sauces on everything were delicious as well. Flemmings is expensive-which is fine, but the things need to be perfect!
October 22, 2013|Great Food!|4|My first trip to Providence ended with this fine dinner at Fleming's which is situated in the Omni Hotel in downtown Providence. The food as always was done flawlessly - service was at a perfect pace, not pushy or overbearing -- like some top end steak houses. While expensive, it is very much worth the price... topped the night off with a nice glass of Belle Glos Pinot Noir. I would definitely recommend a visit.
October 15, 2013|Enjoyable Evening|5|We were pleasantly surprised by this Fleming's in the Providence Omni Hotel. The carpeting in the dining room created a quieter and pleasant environment - even with the 2 large groups of men in the same room! Server was great and staff did a great job preparing our food. The Wine Flight Trio was nice option and their ipad wine list is a great help at selecting from their extensive list of options! Kitchen is open until 11pm, but the door to the bar closes and locks at some point before that!
October 5, 2013|AAAAA+++++|4|This restaurant as always rates at the top. My favorite is the Fleming's potatoes. The pork chop is the best that I have ever tasted.
September 22, 2013|Menu|3|One of the reasons I booked this restaurant were the items on the menu I viewed while making the reservation. There was one particular entrée that sounded perfect for my diet. However, It was not on the menu when we arrived to dine. I asked the waitress - she didn't know about it. She asked the chef who said it was not on the menu and didn't recall if it ever was. That was a big disappointment. Overall good service and ambience.
September 15, 2013|although we were early for|5|although we were early for our reservation we were greeted warmly and seated at a quiet booth. I really enjoyed using the wine pad (iPad with 100 wines by the glass and their pairings) to try something new. Warm bread with 2 different butters arrived and we had a Fleming salad, fresh, green, crispy and served with a chilled fork. My husband had the Prime Rib plate (Sundays) and I had the NY Strip. Both were tasty and cooked. Blue cheese mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were our vegetables and both were superb. FInished off with coffee and chocolate walnut turtle pie. Mmmmmm! Our server Traci was especially nice and fun to talk to. The ambience was cozy, quiet and romantic. Thoroughly enjoyed Flemings and will go back.
September 13, 2013|Wonderful first visit|5|Went to Fleming's for the first time on Sept 13, 2013 for our 38th Anniversary, and my wife and I were both delighted. We were seated at a table near the back wall in a richly wood paneled back room, the kind of atmosphere we wanted for the occasion. Our server Rob was attentive, humorous, and seemed to be genuinely interested in us without being intrusive. My ribeye steak was perfect, as was everyhting. Service was outstanding. Valet parking was quick and courteous. We will be going back.
September 7, 2013|One of the best!|5|There are a few restaurants in Providence where you can get a good steak. I don't think there is another where you can get better service. The food is outstanding, a great menu and wine list. The waiter made great suggestions and the service was the best I've had in Providence. We went for our anniversary and had a great dining expierence. I think of Flemmings as a place to go for special occasions but why wait? I don't think you could ever be disappointed.
September 4, 2013|Dark and very red|3|This restaurant was nice, but way too dark and red. Actually, the gentleman next to us had to use a flashlight to read his menu! Food was good but overpriced. Service was excellent.
September 4, 2013|Last minute decision|4|"Decided to visit Flemings after receiving an email announcing the special of the month and we were more pleased with our meals. The ""special"" was a bacon wrapped filet and 2 crab stuffed shrimp with a blue cheese wedge salad to start. Delicious, delicious."

August 24, 2013|Great food and service|5|The steak was excellent and the service matched, highly recommend
August 24, 2013|Anniversary Dinner|5|Came here for our anniversary and it was phenomenal! Service was friendly and attentive and the food was sensational. Will definitely be back if we are in the area again.
August 17, 2013|Great food|5|Great food, great service Will be back and recommend to anyone
August 11, 2013|Family dinner|5|The Restuarant was something to die for. The service was out of this world! The staff was very attentive to detail and had all the answers to our questions. They made some excellent wine suggestions to go along with our meals. The food is Ala carte but is more then enough to let everyone have a plentiful serving. I would recommend the bone in rib eye steak. In prior visits I was offered a black napkin instead of the white This time it was not offered. Minimal thing but I liked the attention to detail with it. The Restuarant is pricey but we'll worth it. I would recommend it for a special occupation or a romantic night out.
August 11, 2013|Great meal in RI|5|On a late Sunday night we arrived in Providence for a business meeting. We ordered the baked brie and salads to start. All were great. We followed up with the scallops and ahi tuna, both were outstanding. We are even considering going back for another meal tonight. We would highly recommed this restaurant.
August 10, 2013|Delectable steaks|4|If you love steak, then this is the place! Pricey but not so out of reach. Caesar salad split by 2 is a perfect size. The wine pad app selects with you a perfect match for your dinner selection.very cool addition to the dining experience. Extremely attentive staff! Quieter seating in back room and still beautiful! Best calamari I have had in a long time! Small plates very appealing distraction from the regular for lighter eaters or allows you to try a few appetizers and not roll out the door afterwards. Valet parking fee is awful since you are dining here it should be a tip only!
August 10, 2013|Server Was Outstanding|4|Our server, Bob, was simply outstanding! He knew every item on the extensive menu including the drinks. He was very pleasant and welcoming. He made our night! The reason I gave the food only three stars is that, although it was excellent, the beef which we ordered had far too much pepper on it. One of us even had to send it back as he couldn't eat it. Other than that the food would have gotten five stars.
August 8, 2013|Fantastic Evening|5|My wife and I celebrated our 49th Wedding Anniversary at Fleming's, a restaurant unknown to us. From the instant we stepped through the door until the instant we left everything was five star. Personnel, servers, food and atmosphere. I would recommend Fleming's to anyone and it will remain high on our list for special occassions.
August 4, 2013|Consistent and predictable|3|Flemings locations have a decent wine list and reliably quality meat. In most cases (including on this visit) they handle the temperature of the meat correctly.
July 20, 2013|Great food!|5|This dinner was so amazing. Excellent, attentive service. Food came quickly and was delicious.
July 20, 2013|Restaurant week|4|My guy and I made a last minute reservation at Flemings to take advantage if the last night of restaurant week. I'm more than happy we did. The food was very good and the service was great. A bit pricey if it wasn't restaurant week but if you have the money to spend or it's a special occasion, go for it. I might revisit for there M-F bar deal of a tall glass of wine and apps.
July 19, 2013|Wonderful evening|5|Our waiter was great, his wine suggestion was perfect and our meal superb .
Dined on July 13, 2013|Ver good, but small main course|4|We were here for restaurant week. The meals were very good at a good value, but our steaks were quite small.
July 13, 2013|Awesome Service|4|Ken our waiter definitely earned his tip. Very professional, knowledgeable and funny. He was always right there when I finished my glass of wine for a refill. We went in for restaurant week and got the 3 course prefix dinners. It wasn't the best steak I had but I cant really judge since it was cheaper than usually. It was however a little under cooked for medium, Potatoes were spot on. The creme brulee was a little soupy. It should have been more firm. Mortons has never made any of these mistakes but it was still an above average place.
July 13, 2013|Just Wonderful|5|This continues to be one of my favorite restaurant in Providence. Amazing food, wine and service!
July 13, 2013|Date night|5|My fiance and I decided to come here for a well needed date night...the staff was courteous, patient, and pleasant from the hostess to the maitre' di. The menu was thoroughly explained which was a bonus due to it being restaurant week. The food and drinks were outstanding...we will make this a favorite!
July 12, 2013|Usually very good- not rest. Week|2|We decided to try restaurant week at Flemings as we'd recently been to capital grill and had an excellent experience for restaurant week. While the service was excellent, the food was subpar. They downsized everything for restaurant week, when traditionally speaking all restaurants participating provide you with the same food on the menu, portion, taste, quality and all. This experience was like dining out outback, only much more expensive. If you want a great meal, that is really pricey but good service- I'd recommend it but NOT during restaurant week. Not worth it. Capital grill was phenominal in comparison. Great service, excellent food, regular portions. We left full, Flemings we left hungry.
July 12, 2013|Restaurant Week Highlight|4|"We chose Fleming's as our Providence Restaurant Week dinner experience and were very pleased overall. The waiter noted that we were newly engaged upon our anniversary, and had the staff sign a ""Happy Anniversary and Congratulations"" card to go with our complementary chocolate truffles. I had the pork and my fiance had the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. Both were cooked to perfection! The interactive wine menu on the iPad helped us choose the perfect wine pairings, too."
July 11, 2013|Restaurant week|5|We dined here during restaurant week-a great way to try out restaurants at a more affordable price. The selections they offered were great-something for everyone. I got the mushroom ravioli for an app, the salmon & creme brulee. My husband got the salad, filet & cheesecake-we were both very happy with everything. The service was great by everyone-always refilling water,coffee without us having to ask. Also a nice surprise, we got a 4.00 validation for the parking garage. Would definitely return.
July 9, 2013|Eat well, Feel Special|5|Great steaks- cooked exactly to our specifications- tasty, juicy, tender. Service was attentive but not doting. Friendly, but not solicitous. Timely, but not hovering. Servers were knowledgeable and helpful in making choices. Valet service important in parking- deprived Providence. From parking to seating, from service to eating, this was certainly a fine dining experience.
July 8, 2013|Fantastic|5|Celebrating my boyfriend's birthday at Flemings. The wait staff was incredibly attentive and engaging, but not overly so. We loved our drinks, meals and especially the dessert. This is the perfect place for a special occasion.
June 29, 2013|A nice night out!|4|This is not our first time in Fleming's and won't be our last. It was not a super busy Saturday as has been in the past which allowed our server, Bob and his team to spend a little extra time table side. Bob knows his stuff, experienced, helpful answering any questions and not overbearing on the suggestive selling. Crab cake app. was excellent and unlike some places, loaded with crab meat! My wife had a 6oz. filet and I opted for a double cut pork chop...(most might need a doggy bag) both were grilled to perfection. Order a veggie and split it as the portion is more than enough to feed two. Potato selection is good, but the sourdough bread and spreads which makes an early appearance is a great substitute! Save room for dessert.
June 16, 2013|Best service|5|Service and attention were the best; not downplaying the quality of food which was excellent!
May 31, 2013|Amazing food and attentive staff|5|I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday this year. The staff was very attentive with always replying to me with my last name. The good was beyond this world! They even gave my girlfriend a birthday card signed by the staff a gift certificate to come back again and a little something sweet from the chef to take home with her. This was an amazing expirence I would recommend this Restuarant to anyone looking for a special / romantic night out.
May 26, 2013|Delicious!|5|Flemings is a wonderful place to dine. The steaks are best we have tasted and the sides were delicious! Service was great.
May 18, 2013|Terrific Experience|5|"Wow - my whole party was so impressed by the professional and personable service, the fantiastic food and overall terrific experience we had at Fleming's in Providence!!! The Maker's Mark ""Old Fashioned"" was delish!!!!"
April 20, 2013|Great exeperience|5|I love this resteraunt. I try to go one or twice a year.

April 16, 2013|Excellent!|5|We had a business dinner and it was fabulous. Meats were prepared perfectly. Angela was our server, very attentive and friendly - good memory with drink orders, wine and the name of our guest. I would gladly go again for another great experience.
April 6, 2013|Outstanding!|5|Outstanding service. Staff goes above and beyond to make your evening special. Waitstaff is very accommodating and make you feel like their only patrons. Food was excellent, as always. Wonderful dinner, wonderful restaurant.
April 5, 2013|"The chef at my college ""eating"|4|"The chef at my college ""eating club"" would put ""chef's lingerie"" on the menu whenever he was serving steak. That expression always puzzled me until I had a steak at Fleming's. The bone-in ribeye was not only perfectly cooked and spiced but the interior had this unbelievable silky texture. Overall a very nice experience and affordable thanks to a $50 coupon they had sent in the mail."

March 31, 2013|Food was great but it took|3|Food was great but it took them 3 times to get my prime rib cooked to what I ordered which was medium well. Also, the food took way too long to come out between courses. The waitress that was serving our table was great. She took the prime rib off the bill which was unexpected since I did not ask. However, she could sense that we were a little annoyed at the wait times for the food. The restaurant was extremely loud and not really kid friendly either and the $9.00 parking fee needs to be waived with validation. Especially if you are spending $300-$400 on dinner.
March 23, 2013|My wife and I dined at Fleming's|4|My wife and I dined at Fleming's on a busy, but not hectic Saturday night. We arrived a bit early, were promptly greeted and were offered to be seated even though we were early. Our server for the night was Matt and he was terrific as well as his team which worked our section. He explained everything, (including the use of an iPad for the wine list) the printed list is fine for me, IMHO. He answered ALL questions about wine and the steaks including portion size. I had the NY strip and my wife the sm. filet both grilled to perfection. We selected one veggie, (green beans) and skipped the a la carte potatoes...the portions are huge, so we ate the sourdough bread for a starch..It is excellent. Service was fine and attentive.
March 16, 2013|A special occasion|5|as it was my brother's birthday, they had a card for him and a small box of special chocolates for him to take home, as we arrived, they noted it was his birthday and as well as we got to the table, they remembered what I had wrote for a note to them and it was like they knew exactly why we were there and what our special occasion was, it was a perfect evening of a nice dinner and very comforting and relaxing and no feeling of being rushed at all.
March 16, 2013|Very good steak perfectly|4|Very good steak perfectly prepared. Attentive service. Good salads. Nice atmosphere. This is a very expensive restaurant. Strip steak 45$ with no sides. Theyve made some attempts to have lower priced specials, such as the 7 oz rib eye, mashed and asparagas underneath for 40$ . Wine prices are bordering on outrageous. ? 98 dollars for la crema pinot noiir retailing for23$. They are at 4 times retail.
March 2, 2013|Disappointed|3|Great food. Outstanding service. Fleming's could be ATF if they could better manage their front desk more effectively. Didn't honor reservation time and no effort to make the customer happy. Left us with the 'we don't care' feeling. Not appropriate attitude for what they charge.
March 2, 2013|My first time at Fleming's|3|My first time at Fleming's in Providence. I'm sorry to say that the experience wasn't wonderful. Had to wait approximately 30 min. past our Open Table reservation time to be seated. The food was very good, but not exceptional and dining area was extremely noisy.

The service is always impeccable and they go out of their way to accommodate requests which makes it great for special occasions. Food is always good to excellent. Prices are getting noticeably higher for both food and wine.
February 19, 2013|Everything was very good and|4|Everything was very good and what you come to expect from Fleming's. My only critique would be the waiter should learn not to interrupt conversation in order to do his business.
February 16, 2013|Thoroughly enjoyed the food|4|"Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service. Was disappointed to find out that Flemings no longer has the ""Half and Half"" as a side dish. Otherwise everything was absolutely great!"
February 14, 2013|A steakhouse as it should be|5|"Excellent spot for a special dinner...not an intimate environment due to large size and number of tables, but a pleasant environment none the less. Food was outstanding from appetizers to dessert...they truly are a ""steakhouse"", as steaks were well portioned, excellently prepared and neatly served. Great wine selection. Staff was outstanding beginning with reception until the end of the meal...few places exist any more where the wait staff bothers to learn your name (from reservations) and address you by name throught the meal...very customer focused"
February 2, 2013|Although the food was good|2|"Although the food was good and the service decent, this visit seemed to lack the personalized service that we've been accustomed to receiving from Flemings. We had mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating three birthdays. We have celebrated birthdays with them in past and were always given a small complimentary dessert. It's a nice touch. This time, we were not. Considering that the tab was just under $400 for food and drinks, that's just good business. The meal and service were ""ok"".. honestly, with all of the other great choices in Providence, I think that this will be our last visit to Flemings."
February 2, 2013|Very pricey for an OK filet,|3|Very pricey for an OK filet, a bit overcooked. Really rushed too. We were in and out in 50 minutes - not our choice.

I had to send my steak back twice to be cooked the way I requested, and once it arrived it was charred and not very flavorful. They did not offer any complimentary sides or a dessert, I had to sit waiting for my steak twice while my family ate their dinner. For a $45 dollar steaming expected more.
January 26, 2013|The service was excellent,|5|The service was excellent, very attentive but not bothersome wait staff. Menu was varied with lots of speciality items, dessert menu classic and superb. Food was exceptional. Will return in the near future. Highly recommend.

I wish it had been seasonsed a little more, instead of just being wrapped in bacon. Overall, we had a good experience. We took my sister here for her b-day dinner. They also gave her a personalized gift card to come back to Fleming's, which was nice. Would consider again.
Dined on January 19, 2013|we were looking forward to|3|"we were looking forward to dining at Flemings. We were fairly surprised and disappointed at the the # of children there. we were ""stuck"" in the very last table by the kitchen entrance and essentially surrounded by kids playing electronics at their tables with their families severely detracting from the atmosphere and not really allowing us to relax. the main dining area appeared to have no children and we may have been much more comfortable there. wish they didn't stick us with the worst table in the place as we were looking to have a break from our children full evenings at home. . . live and learn. . . we should have asked to move. . . ."
January 19, 2013|Great evening.|5|Out of this world. Tried during Providence Restaurant Week. Service and food was superb. Wine list was out of this world. Will be back without a doubt.

December 31, 2012|Although the food was very|4|Although the food was very good, the service left a little to be desired and I am hoping that it because it was New Years Eve. I would recommend the restaurant for the food, although some of the menu items (especially the cocktails)were rather expensive.
December 31, 2012|The food was very good but|3|The food was very good but I wasn't very impressed with the overall atosmphere. We were shoved into a corner table that clearly didn't belong there and I'm guessing wouldn't have been on a normal night. I'm sure with it being New Year's Eve they jammed as many tables in as possible. We were sitting right next to the entrance to the kitchen, there was constant traffic, wait staff bumping into our chairs. It was extremely annoying. I would have thought for the money it would have been a better arrangement.
December 29, 2012|Our meal was excellent and|5|Our meal was excellent and the service was superb. Our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful with suggestions. Great al a carte menu for sides.
December 27, 2012|I would recommend this place|5|I would recommend this place for anyone who really appreciates food. I had the petite filet and it was so tender that it melted in your mouth. My partner had the bone-in ribeye and stated that it was one of the best steaks and the flavor was exceptional. If you like being pampered, this is the place to go.
December 24, 2012|Server was very good, Angela.|3|Server was very good, Angela. Food was great! Host/GM did not do his JOB! Wine list has vintage for by the glass. 4 I tried to get where another vintage other than what was on the list. I specifically asked for the wine to be poured at our table. 2 times the vintage was wrong. Then I went to bar to see others; they too were wrong. I told the manager he seemed complacent to the fact. Upon leaving, I told him I was disappointed that he never came to our table after advising him of the wine and that I felt at a minimum. Again, he seemed to think the name Fleming's would carry his misgivings! Meal and server could be best in world, but his actions wil not bring my return!
December 22, 2012|The ribeye is always good,|4|The ribeye is always good, and I really like the Chipotle mac and cheese. Having to pay for parking in Providence isn't optimal, but this is one of my favorite spots. I like being able to bring my own bottle of wine. This time they actually tried to charge me $25 for corkage, but I told them no on that one, and they opened my bottle for no charge.
December 19, 2012|The prices are way too expensive|4|The prices are way too expensive for the portion sizes/food quality. The only reason we went there was a $50 gift card from American Express which barely covered one entree and part of a side dish. Only way to eat here is on an expense account. I do like the offer for a white or black napkin depending on whether you want to risk lint on your lap or not.

December 13, 2012|Excellent dinner!|5|I have been to a lot of the chain steakhouses but this was my first visit to a Fleming's. I was truly impressed by the quality of food and really enjoyed myself. I would highly recommend this Fleming's location.
December 12, 2012|The rib-eye steak was way|5|The rib-eye steak was way better than I expected. If I wasn't with a client I would have gnawed on the bone!
December 8, 2012|Food was outstanding. Nice|5|Food was outstanding. Nice wine selection. Accommodated my Atkins Diet just fine.
November 30, 2012|My husband insisted on Flemings|5|My husband insisted on Flemings - I wasn't very excited as our last dine there was average. I'm glad he persevered. Our entire experience was excellent. The service was attentive but not intrusive, martinis were cold and delicious, table was cared for in between courses, and let's not forget the meal. I had the Flemings salad which was tasty, my husband the Caesar which was pretty average. We both ordered the chef's special - a 6 oz filet with 3 shrimp, served over garlic mashed potatoes. Both were very excellent. We ended the meal with the Volcano cake which I highly recommend. I will return!
November 18, 2012|Great for special occasion|5|Went here for our daughter's 16th birthday. Staff extremely accommodating with friendliness. Food was cooked perfectly. Steaks were spot on. Wine prices were a bit high. Small plates are excellent choices with appetizers rather than full meals. Prepare to drop some cash for the bill... It's not your bargain restaurant. Great for special occasion.
November 16, 2012|There really is nothing to|5|There really is nothing to complain about. The service was excellent, the food was incredible especially the butternut bisque. The restaurant lived up to my expectations as a special place to dine on a special evening. Very enjoyable
November 16, 2012|Worth the money|5|I had the lava cake, pistachios was a suprisingly yummy addition. I also ate the small bites filet. Very good. Red sangria may have been the best I've had. My husband had the bone-in rib eye, which he said was the best he'd ever had. The wedge salad was the only mediocre thing we ordered. I thought offerering lint free black napkins was odd, why not just always use black napkins?
November 15, 2012|The steaks are excellent...tender,|4|The steaks are excellent...tender, well cooked, well seasoned. The service is top notch. Expensive but worth it for a special ocassion
November 14, 2012|Not a good evening. Our table|2|Not a good evening. Our table was in front of the kitchen. So loud you could not have a conversation. Could not hear the wait staff. For the cost of the dinner this was very disappointing. We have been to Flemings many times and probably will not return any time soon.
November 9, 2012|Good. Better Last Time|4|Overall it was another nice night out. Food was good. Service wasn't as good as last time. Apps and entrees were good. Caesar salad was disappointing. We took our time dining and weren't rushed. Wine selection was good as usual.
November 8, 2012|Everything about our dining|5|Everything about our dining experience was wonderful. Best steak I've ever had and the service was outstanding. We will definitely return.
November 3, 2012|Good food but really pricey,|4|Good food but really pricey, even for a steakhouse ($8.50 for a baked potato!). Also, be forewarned that if it is busy in town, they will not be offering valet and you will need to add some extra time to self park in the Convention Center or the mall.
November 2, 2012|i had been a big fan but the|4|i had been a big fan but the portions were extremely small for the price. Wait staff phenominal, ambiance great...True steak house feel, but it was dressed up Outback (parent company) steaks. Very similar prices at the other fine steak houses around but not very similar quality and portion. Even the side dishes were more single serving than most steak house portions. Hospitality was off the charts great, but left dissapointed with a large bill.
October 23, 2012|One of my favorite restaurants|5|One of my favorite restaurants ever! LOVE the food. LOVE the wine. Service is always impecable. Service staff is well trained and friendly.

October 17, 2012|Great time with three family|5|Great time with three family members - close attention to detail - wonderful evening.
October 13, 2012|Worth every penny!|5|I brought my fiancé to Flemings for his birthday dinner. The staff gave him a birthday card that everyone signed. Our dinners were delicious and the service was great! After our meal our waiter gave my fiancé a box of truffles and a $25 gift card. We enjoyed our wine and ate at a leisurely pace. Anything we requested we had in seconds. This was our second time at Flemings, our first being to celebrate our engagement, and we just love it! The staff really makes you feel taken-care-of and special. We will absolutely be back and I also posted a rave recommendation on my Facebook page so others will enjoy the restaurant as well!
October 7, 2012|The service at Fleming's is|4|The service at Fleming's is remarkable! The prices are VERY high given the relatively modest sized portions.

October 6, 2012|Our first time at Fleming's!|5|Our first time at Fleming's! Great food and service! Ambience a bit dark but the atmosphere was nice. We will go back there!
October 3, 2012|This restaurant is billed|2|This restaurant is billed as being a steak house and I had to send my filet back because it was cooked wrong. Haven't been here for awhile & don't think I'll be going back.
September 29, 2012|Would have given the service|4|Would have given the service five stars had we been seated in the dining room vice the off shoot from the bar. Our waitress was great- but you could tell she was at the max of her ability to operate since she was constantly on the hustle and sometimes other staff would step in to help out. Otherwise, very impressed with the food and would return.
September 29, 2012|We both had the memorable|3|"We both had the memorable meal, which was not very memorable. Even though they hype this on the website, there is little or no mention of it by the servers on in the restaurant, and I can see why. The portions were small and the 3 ""entrees"" weren't particularly good. The filet was overcooked and the short ribs were chewy. It was hardly what I would call a deal for $49.50."
September 22, 2012|The first thing that struck|4|The first thing that struck us about this restaurant was the noise level--very loud. As peoplle left, it did get quieter. But still very loud. We split the Fleming's salad; just the right amount. We had the surf and turf special: filet mignon and 3 shrimp. Perfecly cooked. Just the right amount. They serve coffee in very big cups. And the cheese cake and chochlate walnut turtle cake were good desserts.
September 22, 2012|It was my wifes birthday and|5|It was my wifes birthday and Flemings couldn't have been any better. I ordered flowers they were on the table. All the staff from Jason our weather to the servers were friendly and joking with us. They make it very warm. Food was outstanding as always.

Dined on September 21, 2012|Great dining experience, quiet.|5|Great dining experience, quiet. We were a party of 5 that needed to continue our discussions after a busy day. The private alcoves were perfect for this, we had privacy and we did not disturbe others. Service was excellent. Very attentive to our needs, but not intrusive. The food, well there is not much else to say about their filet migon. We requested varying preparations, each one prepared perfectly. You do have to be prepared for the price level, puts this as one of the priciest locations in the city. Worth it for those special occasions or important other person. Hopefully the restaurant will take a look at this in light of the current economy. Other locations we checked with were fully booked, yet Flemmings had 3 tables, on a Friday.
September 3, 2012|Another Great Night|5|Great food. Great service. Third time here and it just keeps getting better. Did two flights of wine. Allowed us to try 6 different wines for the price of two glasses. We'll be back soon.
September 2, 2012|GREAT Attentive Service|4|The most notable thing we noticed when we arrived and while dining was the attention from the hostess, manager and our server. Each wanted to be sure everything was great and it was. The food was good, however, getting our food was a bit slow. Most likely it had to do with the $29 prime rib/ 3 course meal offering because the restaurant was very busy. We were very happy and would return next time in Providence.
September 2, 2012|Among many fine steakhouses,|5|Among many fine steakhouses, Fleming's excels in doing all the little things right: delicious food, wonderful service, cards and gifts for birthdays and anniversaries, cold forks for salad, black and white napkin options, heartfelt greeting by managers, well-trained staff, etc.
August 11, 2012|Personal touch made us feel|4|Personal touch made us feel really special; an anniversarry card signed by the staff was very impressive and a nice touch, the Manager personally approached us and was very friendly. All the staff was personable and the main course was outstanding. The only complaint was the recomended shrimp appetizer...very dry.
August 11, 2012|The food and service at Fleming's|5|The food and service at Fleming's was exceptional. Anna, our server, was well informed and offered great suggestions for steak preparation and pairing options. Price was standard for a great steakhouse experience.

August 4, 2012|Was visiting for a conference|5|Was visiting for a conference and was also my first time dining and experiencing the ambiance, service and culinary and beverage options. I had a great experience and will definitely patronize another Flemings in the future!
July 31, 2012|Consistent...|4|Like the other chain steakhouses, Capital Grill, Mortons, etc... the food is very consistent, good, yet a bit overpriced. The wine list at flemmings is a solid list, not too high end, but there are some top wines. Also, there are some reasonably priced wines on the menu. I had the Salmon, two nights in a row. I am not a big fan of salmon but this is the only fish dish on the menu. I actually will go to Flemmings for THEIR salmon, it is absolutly outstanding. Extremelly mild with a barque sauce that is just the right balance of sweet and spicy to bring out the real flavor of the fish. The steaks of my companions were okay. They did not enjoy them as much as I enjoyed mine. I will never hesistate to return to Flemming
July 31, 2012|Disappointed|4|"Every opportunity that I am near a Fleming's restaurant I make plans to eat there. They have consistently been the #1 steakhouse for me. I have always been impressed by the quality of their meats. Sadly to say, this evening steak was surprisingly lower quality. I have never dealt with ""fat"" in a filet... this evening there was a large visible area. Thickness was also different. More like 2"" than the 3"" or more inch I have had in the past. Tenderness was also not the ""butter texture"" I have come to expect. While the steak was flavorful, this was not the big filet I have eaten many times in the past at Fleming's. On a side note, no pun intended, I noticed that the side dishes have been downed sized as well. Stefanie was on her game."

July 21, 2012|Femming Steak house review|4|We enjoyed the Providence Resturant week Menu Food and service were very good
July 21, 2012|We were at Fleming's on the|3|We were at Fleming's on the last night of the summer edition of Providence Restaurant Week.I would rate our meals as average at best. Our server however was very good, very knowledgeable and attentive. We found the wine expensive. A bottle of Belle Glos pinot noir that we can purchase at the regular price in our NH state liquor store for $22 was listed on the wine menu for $72. Based on this last experience at Fleming's, we would probably not return.

June 29, 2012|Fleming's Prime Steakhouse|5|Fleming's Prime Steakhouse is a wonderful restaurant. The food is exceptional and the service is always top notch.
June 25, 2012|One of the best!|5|From the hostess to the busboy service and interaction with staff can't be beat. The food was melt-in-your mouth and the wine was unbelievable. Portions were more than adequate but dessert was just too good to pass up. Can't say enough about this restaurant. I will certainly be back again and again!
June 24, 2012|What can I say, went there|5|What can I say, went there after proposing. Told them ahead of time about the occasion and was greeted by the staff with congratulations and a card signed by all the staff to my fiancee. We had the lite filet with flemmings potatoes, mac and cheese side and she had the filet over risotto. Everything was cooked perfectly and so flavorful. Best steakhouse in providence hands down.
June 20, 2012|The service was attentive|5|The service was attentive and friendly. Sean the bartender made us feel like we were VIPs even though this was our first of many visits!

May 26, 2012|Fleming's is a typical Steak|3|Fleming's is a typical Steak restaurant. The atmosphere and service were good and the steaks were fine but not exceptional for the price. I wanted to find a restaurant with valet parking close to the river for Water Fire. Fleming's served the purpose but I probably would not go back. There are too many really fine restaurants in Providence.
May 12, 2012|Fabulous meal|5|It was our third time back to Flemings and the food was awesome as usual. Since I am not a fan of huge portions I love that their menu has the option of regular size entrees or small plates. The lam chops with polenta fries were exquisite. My husband had steak which was cooked to perfection And the service was wonderful. On several occasions we just stop in to sit at the bar and have a drink and share the wonderful cold seafood tower. Will definitely return many times.
May 3, 2012|COUNT ON FLEMINGS|5|i ALWAYS BOOK RESERVATIONS WHEN I HAVE CORPORATE VISITORS FROM OUT OF TOWN AND AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED. THE WAIT STAFF IS PROFESSIONAL BUT ALL HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, NOT STUFFY OR OVERBEARING AT ALL
April 21, 2012|My wife and I have been to|4|My wife and I have been to Fleming's several times and always enjoy the experience. The food has always been good as is true of the service. This time however it was too good. Our only complaint was that the time between salad and our meals was too short.
April 20, 2012|First time there - had heard|4|First time there - had heard good things - did not disappoint!
April 8, 2012|Pricey but good...|4|Food was great but the a la carte menu can get very pricey for a night out with the family. Not kid friendly either but other than that it was an overall good experience.
April 6, 2012|Outstanding service|5|This was our second time visiting and not only was the food great, but the service both times with two different waiters was outstanding!
March 30, 2012|Excellent service and food,|4|Excellent service and food, very enjoyable evening. Steaks were excellent but the medium was just a touch under-cooked. They offered to cook more, but declined and enjoyed it immensely. No wine captain and the waitress was a bit reluctant to make a reco, but the wine selection is very good and had a great bottle. Chocolate lava cake reco made a perfect finish to a leisurely evening. I give Fleming's a strong recommendation.
March 24, 2012|The restaurant is beautiful|2|The restaurant is beautiful and the service was good. Unfortunately the steaks were not cooked.
March 24, 2012|There have been some changes|3|"There have been some changes since we last noticed. We have eaten at the bar several times recently, but it has been a couple of months since we have eaten in the dining room. The lobster tempura appetizer has become a ""small plate"" which consists of 2 pieces of lobster and an apple salad? Half the size it used to be and an apple salad is available at McDonalds - for the same price. No thank you. Then, a ""Steakhouse"" chain that only offers beef as an entree - no lamb, no venison, a few seafood choices - and I mean a few. My husband was very happy with the addition of the short rib appetizer, nice sauce and very tender. His Crab legs were a good portion - but arrived cool to the touch and were sent back to be heated. Our lava cake-overcooked"
March 20, 2012|Outstanding food and service.|5|Outstanding food and service. The mushroom ravioli appetizer was delicious and the filet was cooked to perfection as ordered. Dessert menu offered very diverse and tasty options ranging in calorie range. None were too sweet. Capuccino was a nice finishing touch. Highly recommend the steaks the house bread with a dash of parmesan. Very pleasant dining experience for our group of six.
March 17, 2012|The service was excellent|3|The service was excellent and the table we were seated at was in a nice quite spot. The mushroom ravioli was delicious and the salad was good. My order of as small plate of lamb chops was also good. My husband ordered the filet with asparagus...the filet was perfect but only putting three pieces of asparagus on the plate was disappointing. When you are spending that much for a piece of filet perhaps adding a few more veggies would be appropriate. If you are presenting on the menu a filet with asparagus then don't present it as a if was a few sprigs of parsley. I understand that quality is better than quatity but that cheapened the dish.
March 16, 2012|Good time at Flemings|5|Hannah was the server and she was very good, had the $35 filet and lobster tail combo and it was fantastic.
March 13, 2012|I have never been disappointed|5|I have never been disappointed in any of the Fleming's restaurants that I have visited and this occasion was no exception! Enough said.
March 10, 2012|looking forward to returning!!!|5|i went there last saturday night with my girlfriend...we had such a great experience that we are to make this place our night out spot. our waiters..ben and matt were the best!!
March 10, 2012|Birthday celebration|3|The food was ok, but not fantastic as our previous experiences had been. The crab cakes were fishy tasting and the Solomon was ok as iound the rub to be very spicy and cooked ok. The cream corm and cream spinach were great!!!
March 10, 2012|Excellent - worth every dollar|5|It was our 15th anniversary and from the moment we walked in to the time we got seated, every associate that approached us welcomed us and congratulated us. Then Heather was an excellent server and superior through the night. We started with the Chilled Seafood Tower- wow! Snow crab, shrimp, lump crab, lobster, and more - incredible display, cold and absolutly fresh! We then slected a trio of wine samplers that were brought in a nice display and allowed us to try different wines. The feature was the PORCINI RUBBED FILET MIGNON - perfect with every bite! Finally - the Chocolate Lave cake - incredible, hot and full of flavor. Overall the experience was fantastic, service impecable, taste experience beyond expectations. Will be back!

I typically go to capital grill or top of the hub, but decided to try something new and I was not disappointed. The food and service were both excellent. They have an impressive wine list although I don't enjoy wine those who do will appreciate the selection. Prices were what one should expect for a place such as this. 2steak dinners with two side orders, two desserts, and two drinks came to about $170 not including tip. My over all opinion is give Flemings a try it's worth it.

February 10, 2012|Treated a friend to Fleming's|4|Treated a friend to Fleming's for his birthday, and had put a note in my reservation about this. Upon our arrival and seating, he was presented with a card signed by the staff. Details like this go a long way. My friend raved about his filet mignon, and considering he finished the entire piece, was quite satisfied. Chocolate lava cake for dessert was also well-done without being too rich and overwhelming.
February 9, 2012|We chose Flemings for a business|5|We chose Flemings for a business dinner and I could not have been happier with our choice. The food was excellent. The wine list was extensive and I cannot rave enough about the service. The wait staff was patient and attentive. The personal attention that we received cannot be compared.
January 28, 2012|Generally, the night at Fleming's|3|Generally, the night at Fleming's was okay. However, I have definitely had better Caesar salad before (and this is not a hard salad to make). The dressing was too strong and the croutons stail. The dessert, carrot cake, was terrible. As we were told AFTER we ordered, the restaurant had run out of confectionary sugar and the chef decided to use normal sugar for the frosting. It was like chewing sand. Just terrible. Not what should happen in a high class restaurant like Fleming's. We got no compensation after complaining.

The one thing that differed for us from our local Baltimore Flemings, was that the staff at the Providence Flemings was a bit more serious and all about business. We look forward to the candid and friendly conversations with our waitstaff when we come to Flemings. Everything was still wonderful and as always, the food was top notch!

The tuna tartar appetizer was also done to perfection and accompanied by a zippy mustard sauce. Atmosphere was warm and inviting, service was attentive without being intrusive. All in all a great experience! I'll be back. My only complaint is that they don't offer a porterhouse steak on the menu!

Service started off great with a friendly hostess and quick attention. After that, however, a wine order was completely forgotten about for about 15 minutes (until we asked) and during that time the server never stopped by. I can't even completely fault the server - because she was obviously running around to other tables - just not ours. The service in general seemed very rushed and not what I would expect for a place like this. On the good side - the food was excellent. The steaks were cooked perfectly, the Potatoes Fleming were delicious, and the choc. lava cake was amazing.

Our waiter was nice and friendly but was not knowledgable on the special dish we had ordered. Everyone acknowledged our anniversary, which was very nice. The Memorable Meal was tasty too.
October 8, 2011|Keeps Getting Better|5|"This place seems to get better every time I go there. We went on the last evening of the Water Fire series, and there were reported to be an additional 300,000 people in Providence. Fleming's had our table waiting in a quiet alcove, even though the restaurant and bar were both packed, with long waiting lines (I had booked a week earlier through OpenTable). They have re-done the menu, and now have ""small plates"" which are outstanding. A great started -- ""crab wraps"" are bits of fresh and moist crab meet on Boston bib lettuce with avocado and tomato. Outstanding. All four entrees in our group were equally outstanding -- mostly filets cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Brock, was knowledgeable, efficient, and kept the meal moving."
October 8, 2011|Wine list is highway robbery|2|Food was just ok.. and very expensive.. What is most ridiculous though are the wine prices. They advertise 100 WBG.. that may be true but they rob you for it. Every glass is the retail price for the full bottle. That means the bottle is 4X retail!! and 6X wholesale. Other reasonable restaurants charge you 2x retail.., I felt severely ripped off. Consumers know what wine costs Flemings.

Dined on September 17, 2011|Delicious and family friendly!|4|My husband was at the Westin in business, Fleming's was the hotel restaurant if you will, I had never thought of bringing our family there for dinner, in the past we went there for the ambiance of date night or with other couples. We were pleasantly surprised when the hostess and overall staff didn't look at us like we had 10 heads bringing our children ages 3, 6 and 8 into an somewhat upscale establishment. They had mini etch-a-sketches for the kids, our server, Joe, was amazing. The food as expected was very good, even the kids liked their meals of chicken steak and pasta. I can't thank Joe enough for catering so well to our needs. I would not hesitate to go in again as a family, for the atmosphere and the food.
September 17, 2011|Great for a specially occasion.|5|We went to Fleming's after reading all the great reviews. The service was great! We were welcomed and seated promptly. The waiter was very helpful, food was fantastic. I had steak. It may have been the finest steak I've ever had, cooked and seasoned to perfection. They have 100 wines available by the glass. A great idea, especially if your dining partner is having a dinner different than yours and the wine wouldn't compliment the other's dinner. Fantastic dessert, we never felt rushed. The only minor problem was I had to pour my own wine after it was put into a carafe. I am looking forward to returning.
September 10, 2011|Took a flyer on Fleming's|5|Took a flyer on Fleming's instead of other steakhouses in the area. We had a 6:30 reservation, arrived 10 minutes late, and were seated right away. The steaks were exceptionally tender and cooked perfectly. The server was chatty but professional. The table was well cared for by multiple people. My only quibble was that we were not offered coffee with dessert, something I could have asked for but really should have been offered. However, that certainly wouldn't prevent me from returning.
September 9, 2011|Too expensive for what you|2|Too expensive for what you get. Food and service at other local steakhouses are better. Stick with the Capital Grille across the street.
September 4, 2011|My wife,son and I were seated|5|My wife,son and I were seated promptly at our reservation time. The service, food and ambiance were excellent. The steaks were done to perfection. The bluecheese mashed potatos were recommended by the waiter and were outstanding. During the course of dinner, even the manager was walking around to the tables and talking with patrons asking if all was going well. Before we sat down we were asked if we wanted a darker color linen (tablecloth and napkin) because I was wearing dark color clothes so the lint transfer if any wouldn't be noticeable. Nothing transferred anyway but I've never been asked that question before in any restaurant. Very classy restaurant.

For $29.99 I enjoyed the filet mignon wrapped in bacon with garlic mashed potatoes. Each portion of the meal was tasty and well presented. I loved their bread as well. My favorite part was the blueberry cheesecake! Our waitress was very attentive. I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal for a special occasion.

May 13, 2011|Meals or Wheels|4|Food was excellent and service was great but two salads, two steaks, two sides and one glass of wine with tip cost $175!! Back in 1991 I bought a 1980 Saab 900 for $175 and drove it for 3 years. My $175 dinner lasted about an hour.
April 30, 2011|The host staff was very rude|2|The host staff was very rude to us when we checked it. We asked to sit at another table due to the noise from the party going on. We were told no. Also, the prices were very high due to the amount of food provided. We also felt rushed by the waiter and staff. Overall, it was not a good dining experience.
April 16, 2011|Food is very, very good.|4|Food is very, very good. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food. Service is just short of excellent. For the price it's a little below expectations -- food on the wine glasses for instance, and the wait staff not QUITE as attentive as one would expect.
April 16, 2011|This was a night when I wanted|5|This was a night when I wanted to take my girlfriend out for a special dinner. Fleming's did not disappoint in the least. From the prompt and courteous welcome on arrival to the last moments our server spent with us, it was a wonderful evening. I especially appreciated the attention to detail that was provided from the use of our names throughout the evening and the sense of luxury afforded to use by the small things, like using a chilled fork for salads. I work at RI Hospital and could very easily see my urology group hosting an event at this location in the future. Will be looking forward to returning soon.
April 8, 2011|Not up to par|3|Flemings had been recommended by friends, so we tried it on a Friday night. Service was excellent as was the menu and wine list. Unfortunately some of the food was not. My husband and I split dishes at any steakhouse because of the size of the portions and so we can try multiple things. The crabcakes were heavy in crab and should have been excellent but were SO salty I couldn't enjoy mine (and I like salt). The caesar salad was woefully underdressed. The steak was fine, but an advertised bone in rib eye has a bone the size of a thumb, not what you'd expect for a steakhouse serving. The mushrooms and creamed spinach were both excellent. I wanted a simple dessert and had vanilla ice cream, which had ice crystals. I will no go again.

January 29, 2011|Overall, worthwhile, but it|3|Overall, worthwhile, but it was lacking in a few areas. Service was a bit slow at times, and the waiter spilled a good amount of red wine when trying to pour a glass. This splattered half the white tablecloth so the waiter then took a dark napkin and placed it over the spill. Worse yet, though, the waiter did not refill the glass after spilling about 1/4 of the wine, and there was no effort to address the fact that some of the red wine splattered on my friend's shirt. The carpaccio was unique and a very large portion, as it also included some cheese crostinis. The tuna was a bit peppery. Steaks were very good and the creamed spinach and mushrooms were tasty as well. A bit pricey so there might be better options for the price.
January 27, 2011|Our waiter, Bob, was so attentive|5|Our waiter, Bob, was so attentive that he noticed the Tuna was not as rare as requested and immediately called for a re-fire. The only slight bump was that when both mains came back to the table, the steak was closer to medium than medium rare. At the same time, Bob suggested a particularly good Cabernet which went beautifully with both Steak and seared Tuna (a rather tight fit). Thanks to all involved, and we will definitely come to Fleming's for another dinner soon.

January 8, 2011|Flemmings is a winner|5|Not sure where the other reviewers are coming from, but I put Flemmings near the top of the Providence dining scene. Steaks are every bit as good as Capitol Grille, but the service is less pretentious and the food less expensive. Flemmings is a great alternative to Federal Hill Italian food, when you're looking for something a little different. Yes, it is relatively expensive, and it's in a hotel (the Westin), but it's got great ambiance, a great staff, and great food and drink. One minor criticism...the wine list is a bit over-priced.
January 1, 2011|We go to Ruth's Chris a lot.|5|We go to Ruth's Chris a lot. Compared to that, Fleming's was dark, really loud, a tad less stuffy, and prices comparable if not a bit higher. But the food was outstanding across the board. We'll definitely return.

As soon as the plate hut the table, it was evident that it was a cut below the rest. Better choices all within one mile are Capital Grille, Prime, 10, Ruths' Chris, in that order.

Since we had my granddaughter with us, her daughter, they also made her feel special. I plan on eating here again and will also recommend this place.

October 23, 2010|On October 23, my family dined|5|On October 23, my family dined at the Providence location of Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, for my stepfather's birthday. Our server, Shakira, had the perfect blend of professionalism and congeniality - making the experience truly special for my stepfather on his birthday. I had to send my steak back for being too rare, and when they returned with the steak butterflied, I was dreading cutting into a steak that was now well done, which is usually the case when returning a steak. Instead, it was grilled to a perfect medium, and they even delivered a full side of creamed spinach with it. The experience was nothing short of outstanding and I am already anticipating our next visit.
October 16, 2010|Fleming's was fantastic. The|4|Fleming's was fantastic. The food is excellent- and not for those calorie-counting! The service was great too, although I am never pleased when a reservation is made, but you have to still wait 20 minutes. Nonetheless, we were able to meet a very friendly bartender and get a head start on the amazing wine list- there really are a hundred to choose from, by the glass or bottle. Sadly, they ran out of chocolate lava cake, but other than that, everything seemed to be available, and all we had was delicious. We had mentioned in conversation that it was our anniversary the night before, and they gave us 10% off our meal. We really didn't expect that at all- it was such a nice gesture. Can't wait to go back!

August 28, 2010|The wet aged ribeye was excellent.|4|The wet aged ribeye was excellent. Better than the Capitol Grill, not as good as a dry aged steak at David Burke's. The side dishes were good but skimpy compared to Burke's or the Grill. I subtracted one star for this reason. Service at the bar was awful. Service at our table was excellent. The restaurant was busy on this Waterfire night, but still quiet.
August 27, 2010|Steaks were cooked to perfection|4|Steaks were cooked to perfection and the Flemings potatoes were delicious! Because it is located in a hotel, some there didn't seem to be a dress code. Some customers were seated looking like they just rolled in from the beach, wearing tee-shirts, shorts and flip-flops. Too nice a place for that to be allowed, especially on a Saturday night. Doesn't anyone get dressed up anymore?
August 14, 2010|Flemmings just became my favorite|5|Flemmings just became my favorite Rhode Island restaurant!! Our meal was spectacular! Our server, Jason, was wonderful! There were three of us. Each item of each course was well seasoned and fantastically flavorful. We enjoyed appetizers: french onion soup, ceasar salad (I'd buy the dressing if they sell it~), and shrimp cocktail. Our entrees were perfectly prepared, we enjoyed: rib eye on the bone, double-breast of chicken, and tuna mignon. We shared sides of: sauted corn, chipolte mac & cheese, blue cheese mashed potatoes, and french green beans. We will return here many times in the future! My only negative is that we skipped coffee and desert to go to WaterFire and then enjoy those at a different venue - our mistake!

We gave it a shot for our 10th Anniversary dinner since we were staying at the Westin and was not disappointed. The Food was spectacular, the service was perfect and we had a terrific evening. Highly recommend!
July 13, 2010|Fantastic food, great specials,|5|Fantastic food, great specials, hot decor, and a superb wine list. It was more than we expected and we will go back again. I want the seafood tower next time! There were gentlemen sitting near us and they looked like they were really enjoying it and it was a spectacular presentation. Our wine flight was served on a three tiered iron rack. Also a nice presentation. We parked in the Providence Place Mall parking garage and because it was raining outside we used the tunnel to the Westin then downstairs into the restaurant without having to go outside and parking was only $1.00 for the first three hours.
