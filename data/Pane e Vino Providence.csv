ays ago|Great Italian on The Hill|5|There's a lot of good Italian on the hill but these folks were great. Reservations on a tough night were well accommodated. Food was great. Annie, our server was a true pro. Super service without that over the top pushiness. Overall a great experience.

ays ago|Gluten-free Godsend!!!!|5|This was my first time here and will definitely not be my last! We were warmly welcomed upon arrivaland taken to our table quickly. The man and woman at the front were incredibly nice. Our server was also great - she explained some of the gluten-free options for me, brought (AMAZING) gluten-free rolls and was overall very helpful. Our meals were great and the GF cheesecake was, as well. Definitely recommended!
February 25, 2016|Very nice ambience - great food and service.|5|The wine, food and service were excellent. Great recommendation from a local.
February 19, 2016|Our experience at Pano Vino was exceptional.|5|We had a phenomenal meal. The wine list was outstanding and staff has experience with all the wines on the extensive list. This restaurant is definitely a keeper!
February 19, 2016|Consistently Good|5|I always know I will get a good meal at Pane e Vino. The food and the service are consistently excellent. This last weekend, I had a friend visiting who is gluten-free, so I called ahead of time just to make sure they had a gluten free menu. Not only did they have a gluten free menu, but they had it waiting for us at our table when we arrived and the waitress immediately asked if she would like the gluten free roles (which were delicious!). I had the Caesar salad and the pasta with Shrimp. The Caesar was good, but a little lacking in the flavor and needed salt. The pasta was delicious and had plenty of shrimp. Once again, another great experience!

I had the bolognese and she had the gnocchi, both delicious. We also really enjoyed the tiramisu. Our server was attentive and very knowledgable and friendly. The host/manager seemed to really enjoy what he was doing, we will likely be back.
February 14, 2016|Loved it!|5|The food was delectable from start to finish. The service was great, and at a good speed for a sit down dinner. Overall a great Valentines Day experience! This place made a great first impression on my date and I, and I am so happy I found it!
February 14, 2016|Valentine's Day Disappointment|3|I can appreciate that Valentine's Day is one of their busiest nights, but the service was not very good and the food was mediocre. The tables were so close together it felt like you were part of the conversation of the couples to your left and right. I had a bone-in ribeye which was on their specials list and it was a VERY thin steak for $38. It was cooked perfectly, but still disappointed. There are so many great restaurants on Federal Hill that I don't think I'll be going back to this one anytime soon.

After eating there, we were all impressed with the freshness of the ingredients and the taste. Everything we ordered was delicious. We expected our bill to be more but it was a nice surprise that it wasn't. We all agreed we would go back again.

On this most recent visit, it was extremely cold outside, and we had our 6 month old son with us. When we finished our meal, the hostess offered to take our valet ticket and have the valet bring our car up while we got ready to go, so we shouldn't have to wait in the cold with the baby. It was a nice touch that was much appreciated.
February 13, 2016|We've been Smitten!|5|Our second annual visit to this delightful trattoria on Federal Hill was as consistent and delightful in every regard as our first visit, last year. Coming down from Boston annually to the Mardi Gras Ball, warms our souls and bodies in the depths of winter. We brought foodie friends last year and none of us wanted to leave the table! This year's meal and dining experience were equally pleasant. My husband enjoyed his veal dish; my baked halibut was moist, hot and beautifully presented with oven-roasted potatoes and crisp perfectly steamed asparagus. The sauce on each dish complimented the food without drowning or overwhelming it. We shared a lightly dressed Caesar salad; a light apple tart with a firm dollop of intense-flavored gelato provided a sweet finish, paired with strong coffee to boost our long evening of dancing! Additional perk: free valet parking in this bustling restaurant district is a great plus!
February 13, 2016|Not good for couples|5|Not a good place for a couple tables too close for a nice conversation without listening or if you're having one but if you are with a group it's a good place
February 13, 2016|Everything was perfect!|5|Everything was perfect!
February 12, 2016|Reliable|5|Never disappoints whenever in Providence we always try to fit one visit in. Friendly service excellent food
February 11, 2016|A staple for years to come.....|5|"Fantastic Resturant with fine food & many great wines. If your looking for Italian wines, their selection is broad & affordable. I for one, enjoyed the ""Super Tuscan"" selections. Service was top notch as there are plenty of people assisting the waitress. We were brought fresh glasses each time the wine changed. Appetizers were excellent, pork with fig, buratta, meatballs all were very tasty. As for entrees, Fradivablo, veal and seafood Fruti Di Mare were all high quality. Definitely a good choice for dinning with your better half and/or a group. Enjoy!"
February 6, 2016|Highly recommend.|5|This was our 2nd visit to Pane e Vino. A group of guys, we make at least 1 trip per year to Providence to catch a Providence College basketball game. This was the 2nd yr. in a row that we dined at Pane e Vino. They have been very accommodating to our group of 10-12. The food is excellent, top notch. The atmosphere is exactly what we want, more upscale. The prices are very reasonable. A wonderful experience. I have received nothing but positive comments after arranging dinner here.

January 27, 2016|No other words to say other than AWESOME!|5|This place is fantastic, the food, service and attention to every detail was the best we've ever had. The quality, taste and delivery of the meal was awesome. The server (Jackie) was outstanding. She was so attentive to every detail and request, no matter how small. Additionally, her personality makes all the difference. She was amazing. No one should leave Federal Hill until they dine at Pane e Vino. We dined on Wednesday, January 27, 2016. This was our second time when visiting Providence and we will always go back. Thank you.
January 20, 2016|Service|3|As usual the food was outstanding however the service was more than lacking. The waitress had way too many tables to service and couldn't keep up. As a result we left there less than satisfied and told the maitre'd the same as we were leaving. It was disappointing because the restaurant has a great menu and the food is always above average.
January 19, 2016|Never disappoints!|5|I have been going there for years and no matter what I order I have not had a bad meal. Consistently delicious dinner .
January 18, 2016|Great gluten free selection with knowled...|5|Great gluten free selection with knowledgeable staff. Service was excellent and energetic. Food was fit for foodies and menu extensive. A great Providence find for a travelling foodie like me.
January 15, 2016|Pane e Vino|3|Restaurant week. Appetizer- beet salad very good, entree- red snapper blah pur√©e under fish no flavor supposed to com with olives - I very small piece. Dessert - tiramisu too much whipped cream. Server young but trying very hard to do everything right- really nice young man!
January 10, 2016|A Special Dining Experience|5|This was our first time for dining at Pane e Vino and it was a most enriching experience. The food was oh-so-good - expertly prepared and presented. Salads were fresh and crispy with a nice light dressing. The main courses made you realize that whomever prepared it knew what he/she was doing in the kitchen - most satisfying. And, our server, Kevin was so courteous, cheerful and attentive - we hope to return to Pane e Vino and find him there once again. The restaurant, itself, is clean and well appointed. It is truly a great place to enjoy a wonderful meal.
January 9, 2016|Not worth a second trip|3|We waited 1/2 hour because the reservations were backed up. We certainly understand this happens, but a free appetizer or drink would have gone a long way in easing our distress. Restaurant was loud, and service okay. Food was good, but with all the other issues not good enough to go back.

January 7, 2016|Favorite restaurant on the Hill! 5 Star!...|5|Favorite restaurant on the Hill! 5 Star! I lived 3 years in Italy and this restaurant takes me back there!
January 7, 2016|Dinner with Friend|5|Excellent Italian food. Veal con Funghi superb. Service was attentive and knowledgeable
January 4, 2016|One of my favorite Federal HIll spots!|5|This is one of my go to places on Federal Hill. LOVE the food. They have a great pre fixe menu and half price wines on Monday. My favorite dish is the Chicken Carciofi- Lemony chicken breast with artichokes. And I love the rolled eggplant on the pre fixe menu. Always a good meal.
December 31, 2015|Not Good|3|We were there for New Year's Eve and it was busy. The antipasto was fantastic but it was all down hill after that. The veal saltimbocca was awful. They use a good quality prosciutto in the antipasto but they downgraded the quality on the veal. It was an inferior quality and shouldnt have been used. It was very apparent it was a lousy quality. The pasta with broccolini and sausage had no taste. The sausage was ground, their was very little of it and it had no taste. Two people had it and both said the same thing. The pasta was way overdone. I had the spaghetti with sausage and meatball. My dish overall was good but the sausage had no taste. The sauce was great and the pasta was done perfectly. We usually enjoy this place a lot but it wasn't good on this night. Very disappointed as it was New Years Eve and we picked this place because we usually like it!!
December 30, 2015|Delicious experience!|5|Went to Pane E Vino for a late Christmas dinner with my fiance. Food was delicious! Make sure you try the homemade meatball appetizer. You won't be disappointed. Staff were very pleasant and professional. We will be back!
December 26, 2015|Poor seating.  Food was good.  Small portions.|2|Made a reservation for two. I was sat within a foot of a large party at a booth attached to theirs. The only noticeable separation was a small gap in the table where we were seated. Not a comfortable or intimate situation for a date.

December 24, 2015|Seven Fishes|4|"Our Christmas Eve dinner of ""Seven Fishes"" proved satisfactory for the 5 Italians in our party. The portions - 4 appetizers, the pasta, and the baked stuffed shrimp and baked fish - were just enough to provide a sampling of this holiday treat. While the pasta dish could have been more garlicy and the baked fish less salty, the meal was enjoyed by all."
December 18, 2015|Unpredictable food.|3|The food can be excellent or mediocre. Even the staff admits that the cooks vary a great deal. The chef is clearly not attentive enough. Always a risk.
December 16, 2015|"The veal was not as good as past visits
..."|3|The veal was not as good as past visits It was dry and not as tender as expected
December 10, 2015|Had a fabulous time with friends at Pane e Vino|5|We had a wonderful dinner at Pane e Vino. There were 5 friends getting together for the holiday season. Our meals where delicious and our server was very attentive and kind. This is our 4th year in a row to visit Pane e Vino for the holiday and we'll be doing it again soon.
December 8, 2015|Always great|5|We had delicious dinner before the theater. They had a pre fixe menu that was very reasonably and fabulous 3 courses. We also had a delightful dinner this summer that was outstanding. Our waiter was new but gave us great service.
Dined on December 5, 2015|excellent service‚Äìexcellent food‚Äìvery friendly!|4|This was our first time trying this restaurant and it certainly will not be our last. this is what we had ‚Äì and you couldn‚Äôt find a drop left on our plates ‚Ä¶ we shared Pan Fried Misto di Mare (Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Octopus) as an appetizer For the main dish, I had orecchiette with broccoli rabe and crumbled sausage and hubby had frutti di mare over linguini Not sure if it was the owner or manager walking around to each and every table making sure that everything was in order and everyone was happy - I thought that was a very nice touch!
November 27, 2015|Italian Food Classic|4|Pane e Vino offered us just what we were looking for. We had enjoyed Providence seafood the night before our visit, so this was a welcome meal. We had three versions of pasta and a butterflied veal chop parmesan. Typically these dishes in Italian American restaurants are over sauced. This was no exception, but rather enjoyable. A very price friendly wine list added to the make the meal opulent and affordable.
November 27, 2015|Pane e Vino is a class act fine dining experience|5|Quiet and peaceful fine dining . Excellent wait and bar staff and our meals were nicely presented and delicious. Great deserts. Unpretentious and relaxed environment results in a comfortable dining experience.
November 21, 2015|awesome duck|5|all the food, drinks and coffee was excellent. Pricy but worth it.
November 21, 2015|GREAT FOOD - GREAT SERVER|4|THIS WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO THIS RESTAURANT. I HAD READ OTHER REVIEWS AND TRIED IT. IT WAS NOT DISAPOINTING. FOOD WAS GREAT AND OUR SERVER CASSANDRA WAS EXCELLENT. ONLY DRAW BACK - AND NOT A BIG ONE - IT IS VERY TIGHT WITH TABLES AND CAN BE LOUD.
November 21, 2015|New favorite for Federal Hill|5|We decided to try Pane E Vino after a matinee showing at the PPAC and had a wonderful dinner. Cassandra our waitress was excellent, she had good knowledge of the menu and wine list and she let us sample 3 different wines before choosing a nice bottle of primitivo. We had a mixed salad that was a little heavy on the balsamic vinagrette. My wife had a swordfish special and I had a peppardelle special with braised short rib off the bone. We both enjoyed our dinners very much and plan to return to try some of the other menu offerings.
November 20, 2015|A Delightful Experience All Around|4|Enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Pane e Vino last weekend with family. The waiter couldn't have been more attentive, our meals were very good. We nabbed a corner table near the fireplace and it was perfect. My advice, not to order the fixed price menu since there are so many specialties to choose from. Wine list offered many good choices and the waiter was kind enough to allow a tasting. Good choice for all occasions.
November 13, 2015|Great food and drink at Pan E Vino|5|Great atmosphere. Outstanding service. Good drinks.
November 13, 2015|Delish!|4|Other than having to ask for a 2nd glass of wine 3 times , the food was fantastic and the overall experience was very positive. I'd go back.
November 7, 2015|Birthday Dinner|5|Having never been to this restaurant before, I knew it would be good because it was located on Federal Hill, but I did not know how good! I made the reservation on-line and was called by an employee to confirm the next business day. During the reservation, I did mention that this was a Birthday Dinner and I was completely impressed with the table when we all got to the restaurant. It had a birthday card on it along with some decorations. Very thoughtful and much appreciated. Our waitress was very good to our large group and understood our sense of humor which made dinner that much more enjoyable. The food was delicious and served very quickly considering that it was a busy Saturday night and we had a large group. I highly recommend checking this place out, I know I will be a return customer!
November 6, 2015|Absolutely delicious|5|I came here for dinner w/ 5 other ppl on 11/6/15 & the food was delicious. I had the special of braised beef over pumpkin,butternut squash raviolis. I still think about that meal & can't wait to go back. Everyone enjoyed there meal. The staff was very friendly. The bar made me a drink that I didn't like so they made me something else. If I had to say one negative thing I would say it was a little too warm. It was a warm night & they could of put the air on. A few ppl in our party were sweating & were complaining about it being so hot but I would definitely go back.
November 6, 2015|The food was delicious, but for the pric...|4|The food was delicious, but for the price, not much of it was given. I would like to see a little more generous portions given.
November 2, 2015|Never disappointing!|4|The food, drink and service were very good as usual. It was a very relaxing evening. And to top it off, it was Monday and all bottles and glasses of wine are 1/2 price! We will be back soon. Thumbs up to a wonderful team. AFS

October 29, 2015|Excellent|5|The very best of Providence's Federal Hill restaurant row.
October 25, 2015|Nice experience|4|We were well taken care of during a family gathering.
October 24, 2015|Seems to be economizing|3|We've been here many times and always enjoyed the experience. However, they appear to be economizing and the menu selections and serving sizes seem reduced - e.g., no bread served with salad. The food is not as electic, still good, but not as innovative. Overall, positive experience and we still recommend it.
October 24, 2015|Excellent!|5|We had a great table in the front room at the window. We were at one side of the room instead of in the middle. So it was quieter there. Both the food and the service could not have been better. There was no rush with our food.
October 23, 2015|Lick Those Plates Clean|5|Excellent meal all around with affordable prices and good portions. I strongly recommend the restaurant!
October 22, 2015|Cozy Italian restaurant for friends|5|We were seated in a separate section in the front of the restaurant with a wonderful waitress, Rosie. She recommended wine and dishes. We had a wonderful reunion with friends and felt totally comfortable and not rushed.
October 21, 2015|Food excellent for the price.|5|We had a nice table near the the window overlooking Atwells Avenue. The service was excellent as was the food. The restaurant had a 3 course pre-fixed dinner that had many choices and the servings were generous. Well worth the price.
October 20, 2015|Stands out in a city of great restaurants.|5|Outstanding staff, great food, friendly, accommodating environment. Their orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe is outstanding (and they were quite willing to explain how we could cook it at home). We order a course at a time, ask for half-orders of pasta, take our time---and they are always happy to accommodate us. We're longtime repeat customers and will continue to dine at Pane e Vino.
October 16, 2015|Top Italian|4|Can get a bit pricy for a Rhode Island local restaurant, but the food is the real deal.

October 15, 2015|Highly recommend|4|One of the best meals I've had anywhere. Swordfish, salad, and gelato were superb. Must have reservations even on weekdays. Closes fairly early.
October 13, 2015|Outstanding!!|4|This was our first visit to Pane e Vino... and let me say it will not be our last! Upon our arrival we got so excited to find that they offered free valet parking from directly in front of the restaurant. Once inside we were welcomed in with a friendly hello and promptly seated at a little table by the front window. Our waitress Annie was great, she was friendly, informative and took the time to answer any questions we had about the menu. We took advantage of the early bird special. Offered weekdays 5-7pm, $24.00 per person includes appetizer, entre and dessert w/coffee. I had the Caesar salad, which was crisp and tasty. For dinner I had ravioli (2 large) which was in a wonderful tomato sauce with reach creamy cheese filling, and for dessert I had the bread pudding. My husband had the bruschetta, which was a single piece of toasted Italian bread covered in tasty flavors of garlic, tomatoes and cheese. For dinner he had chicken parmesan served w/side of rigatoni. The chicken was nicely breaded and covered with cheese and tasty tomato sauce, and he also had the bread pudding. Our dinner was very delicious and we can't wait to come back to this fine restaurant. I highly recommend that you try this spot!!
October 10, 2015|Too Over Priced|3|The food was not up to par. We were expecting a lot for the price and we were disappointed with our outcome. The bill was $90 for just two people and we felt that it should have been closer to $50. The food was not out of this world. We wouldn't mind spending that much money on a meal that was phenomenal, but it wasn't. The filet mignon was bland, and the saltimbocca chicken was just okay. They need to drop their prices.
October 10, 2015|Great food.|4|We were called on day of reservation to change our seating time. We were not offered any incentive which I would have appreciated for the inconvenience. Food was great our server was organized efficient and pleasant. Very busy due to festival
October 4, 2015|Great Dining experience|5|We met a few friends here for dinner. Reservation was easy to make on open table ...pulled to up to valet park... A gentleman greeted us right away. We were early so had a drink at the bar. Bar tender was very friendly and made me a great Rum cocktail. Our table was ready as promised. Waitstaff was very professional and friendly. Dinner selection was super. My friends were raving about their appetizers and dinner. We are looking forward to gathering here again real soon.
October 3, 2015|Awesome food and service!|5|Awesome food and service!
October 3, 2015|Very cute place, but a bit tight quarters!!|5|The food was outstanding, & thats coming from my chef husband!!! Will definitely go back again soon!!
October 3, 2015|Great meal. Great time.|4|Overall we had a great meal at Pane e Vino for our 10th wedding anniversary. The service was outstanding. I love when it's a challenge to decide what to order when the menu boasts so many interesting things. That's certainly case here. The menu was also had some innovative items that you won't find elsewhere. My only knock on the kitchen was that my bone-in veal chop was medium well when I ordered medium rare (in the hopes that it would come out no more than medium). That said it still was a great wood-grilled chop. My wife's lobster ravioli was honestly better than eating lobster -- hard to imagine and very impressive. I noted in the OpenTable reservation notes section that we this was an anniversary dinner and requested a nice table. We were seated at a table with relatively high traffic and the server asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, so clearly my note on the reservation system did not work as intended but it was not a major deal for us and we let it slide. They brought us an after-dinner drink on the house -- thanks again! So for the overcooked chop and the table mixup we dinged the rating by one star. We still had a great meal and a great time. Looking forward to next time!
October 2, 2015|Love it!!! This place never disappoints....|5|Love it!!! This place never disappoints. I had the black squid ink pasta with lobster which was to die for. To be honest, I don't even know what my wife had because I was too into mine. We had calamari as an appetizer which was also great. We normally have the cookie plate for dessert but it wasn't available that night so we passed. Can't wait to come back!!
September 30, 2015|The meal was alright. Service was quick,...|3|The meal was alright. Service was quick, but the buccatini was served in a very thin sauce, and the pancetta (not guancale) was tough.
September 26, 2015|Great dinner on Federal Hill|4|Ate at Pane e Vino for a family reunion celebration. The eight of us were seated at a round table booth towards the back of the restaurant, just before what looked like a private room and just outside the kitchen door. It was perfect. We could all talk because of the table's shape, and the noise level was boisterous but manageable. The food was very good, our waitress was totally on top of her game and funny to boot. We had a great time and will go back. I used to live in Providence, and it was incredible to see the changes in Federal Hill. Will have to come back and explore the area more.
September 26, 2015|I had a reservation for six people and r...|5|I had a reservation for six people and requested a window table. Had to change it to eight at the last minute and they were very accommodating. Our server, Amanda, was wonderful. She was very well versed in the menu and wine list. The food was delicious. The tomato bruschetta appetizer was the best I have had. I also had a special, braised short rib ragu over homemade pappadelle pasta which was outstanding. The bread pudding is also delicious for dessert, as is the affogato. Fabulous evening. My second time here and would definitely go back again.
September 26, 2015|Incredible food|4|Highly recommended by my daughter and she was right on. The regular menu was nice enough but we went with a couple of the specials. My braised beef over fresh pasta was incredibly delicious. It melted in your mouth and the aroma from the sauce made your mouth water. My wife had flank steak with lobster tail and mashed potatoes. Let me say the potatoes were like mom used to make. This place is a gem.
September 13, 2015|Great find in Federal Hill|5|Great menu and good value. Had 4 apps to share and a few bottles of wine. Also had the salmon and house mix salad. But preferred the appetizers. Good wine values. Great attentive service. Loved the Salumi plate and the frito mixto the best.
Dined on September 12, 2015|Magnifico|5|After I made our reservation the host of the restaurant called to let me know our reservation would be for outside dining. He assured me the outdoor space was secluded and nicely landscaped. So glad we kept our reservation! The back outdoor patio was lovely, our server Lindsey was very attentive and the food was delicious.
September 6, 2015|Great place for a great dinner!|5|My family and I went to dinner to celebrate my daughters birthday. The food and ambience were great! The service was exceptional - especially, our waiter, Kevin. We had visited one other time during the summer, and will definitely be repeat customers!
September 5, 2015|It seems that this place has a reputatio...|3|It seems that this place has a reputation for seating people 30 minutes past their reservation. That is what happened to us. So be ready to wait. The food was okay with portions being large. This place is nothing special.
September 4, 2015|Charming restaurant|3|The atmosphere was charming and host very friendly. Our service was slow. Long waits to refill water glasses or bring more drinks. Food was the big disappointment. Salmon was very dry and pasta bland.
August 31, 2015|My favorite Italian restaurant|5|Great food, great service, great wine, great wine prices on Monday night (1/2 price), great manager, Richard, great menu...I can go on and on. Try it, you'll love it.
August 30, 2015|Dinner with old friends|5|We met another couple at this restaurant last night. The dinner was awesome. There was a fig appetizer special that was awesome! We all enjoyed our dinners of pasta, fish, and chicken. The bread pudding dessert was to die for! Our waitress was the perfect combination of friendly, and efficient, coming to the table at just the right time.
August 30, 2015|another great meal|5|We often enjoy a wonderful meal here. Today we tried the tomato festival with both appetizer and entree having delightful tomato creations. WE have never been disappointed with a meal anytime we eat here.
August 29, 2015|Always a great meal|5|Highly recommend - food is fantastic, service is excellent
August 29, 2015|great first visit!|5|This was our first experience dinning at Pane e Vino and it was extremely enjoyable. We arrived about an hour earlier than our reservation time but the staff was able to accommodate getting us seated early without a hitch. The food and service were both excellent. We are already looking forward to our next visit. Parking on the street can be a challenge but valet service is available if needed.
August 29, 2015|Amazing|5|First time there. Very knowledgable and friendly staff. Appears to be family run. Neighborhood gem and the food was amazing!
August 28, 2015|Very accomodating.|4|We had reservations for 4 but ended up with a party of six. We were a bit loud, so they placed us away from many of the guests. Food was very good. Appetizers were a bit small for a party of six. We ordered 3 but not everyone had a chance to taste.
August 21, 2015|Good Meal|4|I though the food in general was good, the meatball were very average but the rest of the dish was good. The lighting going up and down was a distraction
August 15, 2015|Great italian|5|If you are seeking great Italian food, with a very attentive wait staff and extremely quick service then you have to try Pan e Vino. Not cheap, but well worth it. Dinner for 7 was $500.00 including tip. 3 salads, 2 calamari, 2 pasta bolagnese, 1 osso bucco, 2 gnocchi, 1 lobster ravioli, 1 chicken carfucci, 7 deserts, 1 double espresso, 1 sambucco. 1 $60 bottle of red wine. Excellent portions. Great wait staff. Started at 5:30 and were down at WaterFire by 7:45. Perfect.
August 15, 2015|Just visiting|4|Outdoor seating wasn't the best with smallish tables; would be better if umbrellas could be tilted to block afternoon sun and flower bed not so overgrown. Food a little salty for our taste but otherwise good. Excellent service.
August 14, 2015|Below average food in a nice atmosphere|3|Unfortunately the food had very little flavor. Bolognese had no taste. Spinach salad was the best thing they served. Cheesecake was extremely dry. Loved the atmosphere and was hoping for a great food experience to match.
August 14, 2015|food was very good and options plentiful...|4|food was very good and options plentiful; Annie was wonderful server - dealt with kids really well and was more than helpful in meal choices and very engaging person.....would definitely come back again
August 9, 2015|Pane e delish|5|Restaurant is delicious. Tables are packed in so depending on crowd it can be noisy and cramped. Food is delicious. Service is always good. We always enjoy our time!
August 5, 2015|Anniversary Treat|4|We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and this was a great place to do so! It would have been even greater if we hadn't been seated at a table in the back of the restaurant in a corner - I should have spoken up but didn't as the staff seemed willing and able to accommodate. Thus, all in all an excellent choice on Federal Hill which is not at a loss for fine dining - we'll definitely be back!
August 5, 2015|Great Venue!|5|Brought in some colleagues from Iowa and New Jersey. They enjoyed the food. Great ambiance! Staff was awesome. Thank you for a great evening!
July 31, 2015|excellent service, wine, and calorie rich dishes.|3|All was very good with one exception: antipasto tray was overpriced for quality and quantity with supermarket provolone and toistettes that were as hard as a rock, that is both inedible and unbreakable.
July 30, 2015|81st Birthday Dinner|5|Have frequented Pane e Vino for several special occasions and brought out of town large groups from conferences to experience the ambiance and atmosphere of Providences Federal Hill. Staff, Chef and Management have yet to disappoint me on any of my visits.

July 25, 2015|Great Place for Birthday Dinner|5|We went here last Saturday to celebrate my wife's birthday. Table was ready at precisely the correct time. Split a pasta appetizer of mushroom tortelloni . Truly outstanding, 10 out of 10. Dinner was veal saltimbocca for my wife, and poached halibut for me. Both were excellent. Our server was a young woman who did a very fine job. She was obviously well-trained. Highest recommendation for this place.
July 25, 2015|Great spot on Federal Hill|5|The food here was amazing! We were a group of eight out to dinner before going out for my friends bachelorette. We all got something different off the menu and there were no complaints from any of us! I wish we saved room for desert!
July 25, 2015|Great...as always|4|We dined with friends who had never been there before, and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal. It is one of our favorite spots on Atwells. They never disappoint!

July 24, 2015|Great experience!|5|Food was hot and delicious. The service was great. We wanted for nothing. Server was friendly and engaging, not intrusive. Especially loved that the noise level was low and our group could enjoy each other without being overwhelmed by the surrounding tables.
July 21, 2015|Stuffed squash blossoms amazing, only  a special|4|The food during Restaurant week was amazing, however the next time we visited the food was very salty and lacking the same taste as during restaurant week. I was a tad disappointed.
July 18, 2015|Fading fast!|1|Every holidays, we give clients thousands of dollars worth of gift certificates to Pane e Vino. Lately a few clients have given us negative reports. Now this is the third time in a row that my wife and I thought the restaurant was sub-par. Actually this time it was horrible. Over cooked fish and then a replacement fish that was far worse. Inattentive service that disappeared continually. .we waited 20 minutes despite a reservation. A short rib dish that had a tablespoon of meat. The meal took 2:45 and we even took our dessert to go since we were tired of waiting. In the past, this restaurant was a staple for us. Now we are done with it. Oh, how the mighty have fallen!
July 18, 2015|One of the best restaurants in Providenc...|5|One of the best restaurants in Providence and Providence is filled with excellent restaurants. My sister has a gluten allergy and they had an entire menu for her to pick from. It is definitely a must for people who are sensitive to gluten.
July 17, 2015|Restaurant week might have been too overwhelming|3|We were squeezed into a table elbow-to-elbow. Of all the restaurants offered during restaurant week, we chose Pano for their good reputation, but I wasn't impressed. First announcement was that they did not have the sea-bass as advertised, but they were offering an upgrade of cod or scrod or some other fish that was just okay. The rigatoni entree was unmemorable, and it took so long for the desert, so asked to have it packed up to go.
July 13, 2015|We went for Providence restaurant week b...|5|We went for Providence restaurant week but found the menu too limited (no pasta options?) so we ordered off the regular menu. The prices are reasonable so we didn't feel like it cost much more than the restaurant week menu. Everything was delicious and we look forward to going back.
July 6, 2015|Lovely.|5|We had a large party and were treated to a beautiful table next to windows in the front. It was a perfect night with great food and wine.
July 4, 2015|Solid Federal Hill Choice|4|This is another steady Italian presence on Providence 's wonderful Federal Hill. The pasta (lobster ravioli and clams spaghettini) and desserts were excellent. The salad and wines were fine. The space is nice and the atmosphere pleasant, but the crowd was a bit quiet and the waitstaff serviceable yet not especially interested in diners. Recommended as an option among the many good places in the area. You must eat on Federal Hill if in Providence.
July 3, 2015|Awesome food, great spot!|4|Sat out back on a beautiful night. Kevin was a superb server. From apps to dessert, food was amazing, every plate was cleaned or extras brought home. Generous portions, incredibly reasonable prices. Would definitely return!

All of the food was cooked and presented perfectly, and timed well. The service was friendly and attentive on a busy Saturday night. You will not be disappointed!
June 21, 2015|New Patio!|5|Had the opportunity to be seated on the patio - quite nice! We were fortunate that it was not too crowded out there so we had our own little retreat! Food was fabulous as always!
Dined on June 21, 2015|Not as good as I remembered...|3|Took the family to dinner and was greeted as we entered by the host. Even though there were tables available in the front near the windows we were seated near the bar which we did not appreciate since we had small children with us. Service was slow but the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Octopus appetizer was not good. Burnt and chewy. The other appetizer was supposed to have shrimp, scallops, calamari and octopus but was skimpy to say the least.. Also on the cold side. Entrees for the most part were good. My wife had veal scalopini and I had filet mignonette that was overcooked. Kids both had the gnocchi dish. Might give it another try some time in the future but as for now I'd pass.

June 20, 2015|10/10 would go again!|5|It is not often, if ever, that I go to any place over the 2 star dining level. I'm typically a diner and dive kind of guy. I was a little apprehensive when I booked this place as a surprise for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. I was expecting black and white everything, candles on tables, and old stuffy waiters that barely spoke English and looked down on you if you didn't know any Italian. I however, was pleasantly surprised to see an upbeat, happy, smiling and youthful wait staff who truly appreciated our business. They worked together and truly provided a pleasant and lighthearted dining environment that anyone could enjoy. As for the food, long story short: you get your money's worth! Absolutely worth every penny!
June 13, 2015|Ron Glantz|5|This was really a great restaurant. I haven't back to Federal Hill for almost 20 years. My son highly recommended this place and he was right.
June 12, 2015|Our favorite Italian in Providence!|5|Great traditional Italian with lovely waitstaff. If you like a quiet and relaxed ambience, this is your place. The very popular Al Forno is excellent too but more of a mob scene and very hard to get a table on any popular night. Fresh caprese salad was the best I've ever had. Veal scallopini al funghi was delicious. o9ne of our party found the meatballs too beefy and hard, but others have loved them. We asked the waiter for the name of the olive oil they serve and she got it for us! They import it from Italy, of course, along with many other ingredients.
June 12, 2015|Great find|4|Awesome food. Good quantity. Great quality. Not a large place so atmosphere was nice. Tables close but private. Waiters very knowledgeable. Been there a long time. Had the seared scallops. One of the best ever. The risotto was fantastic. Wait staff very attentive. Told lots of my friends to go right after we were done. A short walk from the heart of federal hill. Down atwells ave. Enjoy someday.
June 12, 2015|Too much lemon juice and salt|3|In the past, I've had a couple of very nice meals at Pane e Vino, but this weekend was a disappointment. The kale and artichoke salad was drenched in a lemon juice vinaigrette that was mouth-puckeringly sour, and the roasted artichokes had no flavor. Our entrees were very salty -- and the chicken in my mushroom and chicken dish was rubbery. Service fine. I would still recommend for a weeknight when I assume they still have the prix fixe three course dinners.
June 6, 2015|Good meal. Great service!|4|First of all, our server was fantastic. She recommended and turned me on to a new Italian white wine. Was perfect! Spinach salad with blue cheese and lightly sweetened walnuts was fresh and the dressing was just enough of zing. I'm a seafood fanatic, but opted for the veal with full sliced artichokes in a lemon butter/herb. I requested they don't overcook the veal medallions because they are thin to begin with and I didn't want them tough. Oops! Not what I got. They were overcooked, tough, dry and disappointing. The sauce and artichokes were delicious and the Fontina potato cake was awesome; crispy crust and soft and creamy inside. Too bad about the veal. It was the first time in at least 10 years since I've ordered veal, and this is why. No one knows how to cook (or not cook) veal! I love Pane e Vino, so I was surprised by this dish. I'll go back, but insist the next time that if the meal is not prepared correctly, they're getting it back!
June 5, 2015|Not as good as I remember|3|I made reservations here for my birthday this year. I was looking forward to the quality and delicious food that I remembered. I must say, I was disappointed. There was nothing special about our meal. The mixed fried appetizer was okay but just tasted like regular fried calamari. It was mostly squid, though it was sold as squid, shrimp and scallop. The Caesar salad was overdressed, my father's steak which was ordered medium rare came back cooked unevenly. The edges were almost medium well. My lobster fra diavolo has so much sauce on it that it comletely overpowered the squid ink pasta it came with, as well as the lobster (which was overcooked). The only saving grace was our waitress who had a great personality. Very disappointed overall and will not be returning.
May 30, 2015|Worth the Drive|5|We drive over an hour to dine here. The food is delicious and served very appetizingly. The waiter and staff are very accommodating to serving favorites that are not currently on the menu. If you are looking for a romantic dining experience or going to dine with someone you want to impress this is the place!
May 29, 2015|Definitely one of Providence's gems|5|"Double celebration of my 40th b-day and our 16th anniversary. Our server Allyson was delightful and attentive. The food was divine. All of our dishes focused on the freshness and flavors of the central ingredients with no attempts to confuse it with exotic sauces, while still retaining complexity. The burrata: to die for. If heaven were a ball of mozzarella with a creamy center, this would be it. Calamari: well prepared. My lovely bride had the mushroom tortellini. Creamy luxerious goodness. I had the special zuppa di pesce complete with whole lobster on risotto. The shellfish was fresh and properly cooked. Flavors were true. The tomato sea broth in the dish was however, too salty. Even if it is a ""sea broth"" the saltiness made it difficult to appreciate the other components of the broth and risotto. Despite this, I ate with gusto and had a big fat gutso by the time I finished it. The ambience was romantic and we felt at home. Pane e Vino will be on a very short list of places we choose to celebrate any special occasion!"

May 24, 2015|Great food.|5|Great restaurant. The food and service were terrific. They seem to have a nice wine list but I am a beer drinker (and that list was little more limited). Complimentary valet parking. Overall a very nice experience.
May 24, 2015|Pane e Vino Delighful|5|We selected Pane e Vino for Brown University post commencement dinner. We had 11 people in our group. The food and service were exceptional and the atmosphere was warm and intimate. The salmon special was a crowd favorite. The pasta dishes were unique and excellent. Although the restaurant was packed, the wait staff was attentive and patient. Valet parking and easy entrace started the experience off on the right foot. The restaurant made our celebration complete. It is two days after our dinner and I am still receiving calls raving about the restaurant!
May 24, 2015|Fantastic experience|5|We had a surprise birthday party there for 10 people. The staff was exceptional and even helped us keep up the ruse until the birthday guest was brought to our table. The food was excellent and menu varied. The staff couldn't have been more helpful - even when we were being a little rowdy and in their way taking pictures of the event. Will definitely go back. We meet family in Providence and used to meet at Hemenway's, but we've found a new spot for the foreseeable future.
May 24, 2015|Delicious!|5|We usually stay away from Atwells St. IT can be very touristy and overpriced. BUT I saw a review on Open Table so I decided to take a chance. And a lucky chance it was. My husband and I had salads-- caesar and a baby spinach salads‚Ä¶.both rave worthy. My husband had frutti de mare and I had the eggplant. There was a sizable and varied portion of fish and the sauce was amazing. My eggplant was dipped in flour and wood grilled before adding parmigiana. Oh, so unbelievable delicious. The tomato sauce was just right. Not too tomato-y or bitter. We ate outside in a patio with high walls and lots of big umbrellas . This sort of his the urban aspect of the location. It was very very pleasant and I highly recommend this restaurant.

May 18, 2015|Great spot for fine wines and excellent food|4|The food and wine are both equally delicious. I went with my significant other for her birthday, and she absolutely loved it. The meals were both pretty heavy on the sauce, but besides for that it was great. I highly recommend Pane e Vino
May 17, 2015|"""Delicious"""|4|"We had a small graduation celebration here. Wait staff was informative & friendly. The table rated the meatball appetizer an ""8"". The caprese salad was also great, with fresh ingredients. My husband got 2 meals from the chicken Parmesan which was crispy with the right amount of sauce. We will surely return!"
May 16, 2015|GREAT PLACE TO EAT!!!|5|My daughter graduated from college this past weekend. To celebrate, I brought the family, to include my daughter, as well as a group of her friends to celebrate. No only did they accommodate our large group, but the food and service was EXCELLENT!!! Out server was amazing and very engaging!! This was the first time I had ever dined at this restaurant. It surely will not be the last time!! Thank you for an amazing experience!!
May 16, 2015|AN AMAZING EVENING FROM BEGINING TO END!|5|I made an online reservation and wrote in the special request line that we were celebrating my husbands birthday. I was called the night before from Pane e Vino as they advised me my reservation was all set, which was comforting to know. Upon arriving, the Valet service couldn't be any easier! They were extremely friendly and perfessional. Our table was ready exactly at our reservation time and as we were seated at our table for two, they had little birthday confetti on the table and a card which I thought was so thoughtful and perfect as his day was filled with lots of fun and surprises! This was our first time at Pane e Vino and our waiter Nick was outstanding! He took the time to answer any questions and made sure everything we ordered was perfect. The dinner we ordered was delicious! Their menu had something for everyone and it was hard to choose between the menu and their specials! Nick also made sure our car was ready for us when we we all set to leave. great service, great food! It is now our new favorite restaurant! A wonderful evening and a great end to a wonderful day!
May 16, 2015|Very Accommdating, great food, great staff!|5|We went there after my sons college graduation, they opened up early to accommodate our group and others. Food was delicious, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
May 14, 2015|four for four|4|Four of us went and were all first timers. We were impressed with the menu. It had a lot of classic italian, seafood as well as fresh seasonal ingredients. If you like your veal chop pounded and still on the bone this is the place. If you like a variety of seafood apps this is the place All was good and low key.
May 10, 2015|Great experience|5|We visited Pane E Vino for the first time on Mother's Day. I was afraid that it might be over crowded and crazy. Everything was wonderful! My mom and all my guests were very pleased with the food selections and we did a lot of sharing. The wait staff were very attentive. Our water glass never got beyond 3/4 full. The atmosphere was busy but pleasant. I will definitely return to this restaurant and will tell my friends.
May 10, 2015|Mother's Day & Parents Aniversary|5|We had a party of ten for lunch at 12:30 on Mother's Day which was also my parents 57th wedding anniversary. The service & food was great!
May 10, 2015|We were six for mothers day. Only false ...|4|We were six for mothers day. Only false note was the Prosecco in a red wine glass rather than a flute. Salads, gluten free calamari and other apps were very good. Two of us had the lobster fra diavalo, which was terrific. Reports on the lobster ravioli and salmon also quite good. We skipped dessert but it looked good going by. It was pricier than some in the party expected but definitely value for the money.
May 9, 2015|A neighborhood find!|5|Annie our server was outstanding; informative and friendly and not pushy . I asked for a recommendation and she was spot on; the Chicken Milanes was outstanding. My friend has the chicken parm and he said it was the best he ever had.
May 9, 2015|Always the best...|5|From Newport to Providence, it is by far one of the outstanding restaurants in RI. The menu reflects Italian cuisine at its best. The specials are consistently 'special.' The wine list is notable along with the after dinner drinks. Espresso and cappuccino is made from a real machine...NOT A POD! Desserts are all homemade. The staff is very knowledgeable and professional. If in RI, you must dine at Pane e Vino!
May 9, 2015|Food & service were excellent !|5|First time at Pane e Vino & definitely will go back! My friend and I were both extremely happy with our delicious dinners, and we also were very pleased with the wonderful service.
April 28, 2015|Slow service it took 30 minutes to get a drink|2|Slow service it took 30 minutes to get a drink. Cramped tables food was just ok. there are too many other better choices in Providence.
April 27, 2015|Enjoyable Dinner in Attractive Room|4|We celebrated my husband's birthday last week. The appetizers were good--the meatballs and a caesar salad followed by excellent entrees--a veal chop and chicken with artichokes. We ordered an excellent bottle of wine that was priced beyond what we would normally order thanks to the generous 50% discounts offered on Monday nights. The servers were wonderful and friendly. I highly recommend Pane e Vino.
April 22, 2015|Foodgasm|5|This was an amazing meal. Our server was very accommodating for my husband's food allergies. Try the burrata , you will not be disappointed!!
April 21, 2015|Great find!|5|This restaraunt was a total hit! The food was amazing, the service was top notch! The waitress, Cassandra, was so sweet and attentive! We had a great time!
April 21, 2015|Great experience|5|First time visit - great window seating, fantastic service, wine & food. Relaxing atmosphere - perfect night.
April 17, 2015|Great food! Already recommended to a friend!|5|Great food! The veal chop was amazing! Already recommended to a friend who was looking for a restaurant on the hill.
April 13, 2015|always a great time|5|My friends and I have started making this a regular location for our get togethers. The food is always great! If you go on a Monday night for 1/2 off wine bottles, be sure yo make a reservation.
April 5, 2015|Pane e vino|5|"The food here is fabulous! We ordered a cheese and meat board which was amazing. It came with little dishes of honey and fig spread, which truly complimented the meats and cheese. Our entrees were pasta dishes that were cooked a ldente, which is how we like it. The red sauce was perfect. I am a very ""picky"" Italian food eater. I am a foodie and an accomplished cook, so when I say it was good, it was. We were there on Easter Sunday, which was a very busy day, our server was spot on, and seemed to sense when to approach the table. She was great. Overall, a fabulous experience, I would highly recommend this place for a date night or any other time!"
April 5, 2015|Easter Dinner|4|My family was very happy with our meal. I had the lamb special, and my wife had the Fruii de Mare. Both very good. Our 18 month old was here, too, and he was quite comfortable with his surroundings.
April 2, 2015|Very good as usual but wonder if new cook|4|"My veal parm did not appear the same as before. It was breaded heavily and appeared deep-fried. There was no choice of pasta as before. Loved ""Annie"", our server."
March 30, 2015|Perfection|5|This restaurant is fabulous . Valet service is friendly and an added bonus . Wine list was thoughtfully chosen. I had the braised short ribs over a sweet potato mash with asp. Entree was executed perfectly. Great service , great food ,and an enjoyable evening.
Dined on March 22, 2015|Fit for Italiens|5|We had an excellent meal. Our Italian exchange student was impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food. All the meals were fantastic.

This time the menu had several different items that i requested be put together for me, borrowing one element from one dish to compliment another to my taste. The staff and the chef obliged with pleasure. Next time I will stick to a standard menu offering, but it was fun this time and the accomodations made were done without objection. Great atmosphere, cuisine and staff.
March 9, 2015|Outstanding Italian on Atwells Street|4|I dined at Pane e Vino with my two daughters this week and we had a terrific experience. The decor is low key and inviting - very pleasant. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. Our meals were excellent: Orecchiete with Sausage (bold flavors but not too heavy), Flat Iron Steak (perfectly cooked), and Scallops (excellent). I have dined at many Italian restaurants and would highly recommend Pane e Vino.
March 7, 2015|We've never been disappointed by Pane e ...|5|We've never been disappointed by Pane e Vino and this visit was no exception. It was lobster week and I ordered the steak & lobster special. Steak was cooked to perfection and everything was excellent. My wife ordered the lobster mac & cheese and WOW, it was really awesome. Piping hot and nice creamy cheese sauce. Would definitely recommend Pane e Vino.
March 7, 2015|Fabulous food|5|Food is outstanding. Service is awesome. In all the years we've been eating here, we've never had a bad meal.
March 7, 2015|Fabulous dinner and atmosphere!|5|We were searching for a gluten-free friendly restaurant to cap off a day out in Providence/at the theater. Pane e Vine did not disappoint! Wonderful manager, attentive waitstaff, charming atmosphere, great wine list and delicious food (from appetizers right through to coffee and dessert). Highly recommend! Definitely make a reservation to avoid long waits!
March 2, 2015|No matter you order it is delicious|5|..constantly awsome food and the staff is always pleasant and accomodating
March 1, 2015|Loved it!|4|Our first visit. Went for my wife's birthday with our two adult children. Was much cozier than I imagined and quieter. Didn't have to shout to be heard. Menu was so inviting we shared a bunch of appetizers. Couldn't finish our delicious main courses. Waitstaff was very friendly and prompt. Will go back soon.
March 1, 2015|Excellent Food and Service|5|A business colleague and I visited Pan e Vino as a possibility for a future group dinner. We were very pleased with the food and service we received while at the restaurant. The Calamari was unique and tasty and both our entrees were excellent. Very highly recommended.
February 28, 2015|First time...could be my new favorite|4|First time and impressed. Buratta appetizer was great, altho it would be even better with ripe summer tomatoes. Had the Frutti de Mare from the menu with squid ink pasta. Outstanding, each item was perfectly cooked. Also, the lamb shank - equally impressive. Combined with a very nice sangiovese/colonio and an extensive Amaro list. The only down side ... the music mix Billie and Ella to techopop stuff. Would prefer something easy so you can have a conversation.
February 28, 2015|Night out|5|Overall a great experience. It is a small restaurant but the food is fantastic, the decor is beautiful and the service was wonderful. Only issue is the tables are very close together, not a lot of room between guests, but the food makes up for that.
February 8, 2015|A delicious dinner!|5|My husband and I decided to have dinner before going to see a Trinity Play and decided to try this restaurant. Providence is know for its amazing Italian food, and we have very high standards! We shared their famous meatball appetizer and a half plate of the Pork Belly that was a special of the night. Both were sumptuous! My husband had a pasta dish and I had the duck- amazing- unusual favors and a very delicious. I was too full to order dessert, but my husband had their signature bread pudding and was constantly licking his lips! He wished he had the recipe!
January 30, 2015|Always excellent|5|Pane e Vino is consistently excellent. Every time.

January 23, 2015|Great service|5|This is the place if you want good food,wine and service. You will love the vibes.
January 17, 2015|Good food but stay away from the door|4|We visited Pane e Vino on a busy Saturday night. We waited a few minutes before being seated. Unfortunately, we were seated right behind the desk by the front door. We were blasted by cold air every time the door open (frequently) and the curtains did little to block the flow. Our server was attentive and patiently answered questions. She was attentive and saw to our every need. The salads (spinach and roasted beets) were excellent. The main courses were much less satisfactory. Both (orrechiette and gnocchi) were quite salty and the orecchiette was overcooked. We shall try Pane e Vino again.
January 17, 2015|Perfectly fine|3|"We went in with a large group, so it is understandable that the service was a little slow, but not bad really. Everyone seemed very satisfied with their meals, it was only the real foodies that said it was just ""okay"". Friendly, helpful staff, friendly atmosphere overall."
January 16, 2015|A favorite when visiting Providence|5|We were on Friday night and had an excellent meal. Two vegetarians, one gluten free and one lactose intolerant diner can make selecting a restaurant difficult. Pane e Vino never disappoints and has selections for everyone and they are willing to make small changes to the dishes to accommodate allergies. Our service was exceptional and the overall experience was lovely. If you want excellent service, good wine and a fantastic meal, I highly recommend Pane e Vino.
January 12, 2015|mediocre food not worth the price you pay|3|This was my first visit to Pane e Vino. The atmosphere and service were impeccable. I felt the food was mediocre and definitely not worth the very high prices paid. The serving size was also less that I expected.

January 5, 2015|Favorite Italian Restaurant on Federal Hill|4|Best all-around Italian restaurant on the hill. Great food that goes beyond the Italian-American staples people have come to expect. Service is good, complimentary valet, nice atmosphere, and it's never been too crowded in my experience. Half-priced wines (bottles and glasses) on Mondays is a nice thing.

December 29, 2014|A delicious dinner|5|"Recently my husband and I enjoyed a romantic dinner with a wonderful bottle of Amarone, taking advantage of the ""1/2 price - any wine"" special they have every Monday. It happened to be our anniversary so we got lucky! We split 4 items, one from each category, all very good. We had a burrata cheese/tomato appetizer special-very good. Caesar salad was just o-k, a little scant on the dressing, but generous portion. For a pasta course we split the duck confit and marscapone ravioli-this was very tasty, a nice blend of sweet and savory. Finally we enjoyed a large veal cutlet milanese with arrugula salad, finished with fresh lemon. The restaurant was vibrant but not loud, with a cozy atmosphere. Our server was very familiar with both the food and wine menu and was both pleasant and efficient. Overall, a good experience. I would recommend trying!"
December 24, 2014|Wonderful experience!|5|We came here for a nice Christmas Eve dinner. This was our first time here and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food and the service was. Would definitely dine here again!
December 21, 2014|Love this place!|5|We dine at Pane e Vino whenever we visit Providence (we live in Boston). The dining room is lovely, the menu is intelligent, the service is always very good, the food is very nicely prepared, and we never feel that we're being rushed along. On our last visit, everything was very good, as always, but our server, Annie, was simply off the charts. Charming, efficient, quietly amusing, attentive without hovering, friendly and welcoming ... she made our evening even more wonderful than usual. Thank you to the management for being smart enough to bring her on board, and thank you to Annie for a stellar dining experience!
December 20, 2014|Overall good|4|The meatball and beef tartare appetizers were very good. Duck comfit - the duck was cooked so well. Was not a big fan of the ravioli and the sauce. The sauce was almost painfully sweet. almost dessert like. Bolognese sauce was tasty but found the sauce too watery - probably from the noodles. Lambshank was fall off the bone good but again the sauce was sweet. my ex-wife told me that the squid fra diavolo was too salty. I didn't think so but maybe it was just the lobster. Service was friendly and punctual.
December 19, 2014|IMHO: The Best of Federal Hill|4|Pane e vino has never disappointed me. Of all the Italian Restaurants on Federal Hill, I find the cuisine at Pane e Vino to be the most authentic compared to restaurants in Italy. They present the classic Italian menu along side of inspired creations with usual Italian ingredients. And they don't mind making reasonable substitutions. Living on Federal Hill, I am often asked by friends which restaurant I would recommend, and Pane e Vino is always the first on my list for Italian food.
December 12, 2014|Outstanding Italian Restaurant|5|One of our favorite restaurants in Providence, and once again we enjoyed an outstanding meal. From the courteous valet parking service, to the hospitable hostess, the efficient wait staff and the amazing food, Pane e Vino always delivers. Outstanding menu of Italian specialties and a wonderful Italian wine list to accompany them. You can't go wrong at this restaurant.
December 11, 2014|A destination restaurant|5|This was our second late afternoon dinner at Pane e Vino, and we drove from the Boston area to Providence because we now believe this to be our destination restaurant. Excellent food, the freshest ingredients with all the flavor of slow cooked and well crafted food. We'll be back.
December 7, 2014|Pane in my wallet|3|Place was very good, service was excellent. But for a $40 entree, you think you would not have to spend $10 on a salad. This place is expensive, there are better options on Atwells Ave.
December 1, 2014|Great Local Spot|4|"The food was good with a nice assortment of local Italian dishes and a special fish offering. Our waitress was rather brusque. This may be an ""East Coast thing"" and we are from the Pacific NW were people tend to be kind of warm and fuzzy. When we asked for a wine suggestion she suggested the most expensive wine on the menu ($78), I said I didn't want to spend that much for a bottle of wine. Her reply was ""not even on half price night?"". Granted, it would be less than the posted price, but I didn't appreciate being challenged on my price point choice. The wine she then suggested was pretty bad. I felt like she intentionally suggested a poor wine because we didn't go with the expensive one. She then seemed annoyed when we didn't want any of the specials she suggested. However, we did like the food we ordered. My husband had lobster ravioli and I had lobster with squid ink pasta. She had warned me it would be spicy, and it was probably more spicy than is should have been. It overpowered the lobster somewhat. But I like spicy food and enjoyed the dish. The tiramisu was the best part of the meal. The waitress warmed up toward the end of the meal and seemed quite friendly when she brought the check. The hostess and other wait staff we all very attentive. I would definitely go to the restaurant again."

November 17, 2014|Awesome menu in a friendly, comfy environment|5|We recently returned from a two week trip to Italy. Every day we dined at the finest restaurants and loved every meal. Our experience at Pane e Vino was simply an extension of that Italy trip. Molto bene! Lastly, it never hurts to be greeted by the friendly manager, Richard, who enhances our fine dinning experience.
November 16, 2014|Poor service Sunday|2|Service was very slow although our server was very knowledgeable. A table of regulars received much better more efficient service than we did. Disappointing. Unfortunately the food did not make up for our frustration with the service I.e. Had to stop our server to ask for a 2nd glass of wine.
November 15, 2014|Good overall|4|We dined here to celebrate a birthday & the food was wonderful! The service was also excellent. Our party of 2 was seated next to a large birthday party, so it was a little noisy for us. The other main issue was that we ordered a bottle of white wine which arrived warm. The server was very gracious and offered us a free glass of house wine while we waited for it to chill. Unfortunately, by the time it was ready, we were done with our entrees. However, the server was again gracious and took it back immediately.
November 14, 2014|Great service and great food|5|This was my first time there. The service was wonderful. The food was delicious. Every dish was unbelievably tasty. I will definitely be returning!
November 14, 2014|Prix-fixe is a great buy!|4|Really enjoyed the prix-fixe meal we had here on a Friday evening--an excellent buy for appetizer, entree, desert, and coffee. Attentive service.
November 13, 2014|Service and quality ...|4|Service and quality were top notch. Everyone went out of there way to make sure we were satisfied. Very attentive staff. Food was very fresh and prepared well. I personally found the food to be, while high quality, not significantly different in taste than what I have had at many other restaurants. They do try variations on some themes, but to my taste buds they taste relatively ordinary. However, I am prejudiced and think that Providence has some of the best restaurants in the country. So in Providence, you have to be even better. Being equal too isn't enough. For instance, maybe a light sauce option on the asparagus rather than just plain, to add a different dimension. The red sauce was just ordinary - I felt I could make it at home with little trouble. My date agreed. That may be simply us though. The crowd seemed to like everything the way it was just fine. To end, I would recommend this place to anyone and since this was my first time would probably return to sample other dishes to confirm or refute this review.
Dined on November 3, 2014|Wonderful evening!|5|We chose this restaurant to celebrate our son's 25th birthday. I had requested a window table and they not only had a window table reserved, but had placed a birthday card and some confetti on the table. The food was outstanding, as was the service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or for anyone who appreciates fine Italian food.
November 3, 2014|Lovely|5|There were four of us who had not seen each other in a while and wanted a place to enjoy a good meal and to talk. Even though there were others dining close by, there was no problem with hearing our own conversations. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The plates were plentiful and delicious. The price fixe menu that two of us ordered was generous. The tiramisu was as light as air. Our waiter and staff were helpful, courteous, and unobtrusive. The manager came by several times to check if all was okay. Our every need was met. A truly lovely experience.
October 25, 2014|We visited Pane e Vino last Saturday nig...|5|We visited Pane e Vino last Saturday night with our group of 10 and had a lovely experience! The service was superb, the atmosphere was lively and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The menu had many unique Italian dishes, as well as traditional meals. They were very accommodating with modifications we needed to make to the menu for a few of the dishes. I would highly recommend this restaurant, as we plan on returning again soon!
October 25, 2014|Everything was GREAT! Super busy Saturda...|5|Everything was GREAT! Super busy Saturday night and table was ready on time. Great, knowledgeable server. Whole family had a wonderful time.
October 25, 2014|Lovely evening|4|We were a party of seven. We had a great waiter named Kevin who was terrific and has a great personality. Everyone loved their menu selection!

October 24, 2014|Great Hidden Gem|4|I've been to many restaurant, but none captured the experience I had at Pane e Vino in Providence. The service was great (full of smiles), timely and passionate about the food. This place is great for special occasion and groups. I look forward to returning again.
October 21, 2014|All around magnificent experience.|5|Service was off the charts. From the greeting through the goodbye we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The food was absolutely delicious. The way the server presented the specials induced us to try them. and they were all excellent. Each plate was absolutely delicious! This was a business dinner and our clients strongly indicated that for their next trip to RI, they want to dine at Pane E Vino and want Jackie to take care of us.
October 21, 2014|Wine Tasting - wonderful!|5|Great experience enjoying wonderful new wines with an excellent four course meal. The pairings were superb, the presentations by the vintner and his daughter were interesting and charming. A delightful evening!
October 20, 2014|Outstanding food and service|5|Pane e Vino remains a delight to visit. Outstanding food. Homemade pasta. Veal dishes. Venda lobster ravioli. Servers are knowledgeable and friendly. And on Mondays all wine either by glass or by bottle are half price. Dive in you won't be sorry. This remains our federal hill favorite.
October 19, 2014|Great Birthday Dinner!|5|My first time at Pane e Vino and I had a great time. It was my birthday and they decorated the table with HB glitter and a card. The service was excellent, particularly a most attentive busboy. The food was very good. I have celiac disease and there was an extensive gluten free menu. I had veal parmigiano which I have not had in a while. Portions big enough for next day lunch. I will go back!
October 18, 2014|Rhode Island Italian|3|Top notch service here, lots of action on a Saturday night, even though packed prompt and well-trained service staff. My only quibbles is that the entrees are HUGE, way too much food. They could lose a third of the portion --and the price. Or, here's a thought, offer half portions of pasta as so many places do. Very fair wine pricing, too.
October 18, 2014|Food always incredible!|4|I always look forward to dining at Pane e Vino! No matter what I or my guests order, the food is incredible. For myself, the Carpaccio is THE best anywhere! The only problem we had this time, unusually so, was our server. Evidently she was new, according to the manager....but she was unlike any server I have ever had before in that her behavior was inappropriate....not the normal problems a 'new server' would exhibit. I can not imagine she will thrive as a server, anywhere. Regardless, the staff has always been incredible here and I highly recommend everyone to go.
October 13, 2014|Columbia Day Festival|5|Four of us went to the Columbus Day festival and ate at Pane e Vino. Even though it was a holiday we were able to enjoy the half price wine on Monday and the fixed menu. As always we enjoyed a terrific italian wine and great food. My favorite restaurant on Atwells.
October 12, 2014|Perfection!|5|Always a perfect meal with wonderful service from start to finish!
October 12, 2014|Birthday Celebration|5|I made a reservation for my husband's birthday celebration with some friends. When we arrived at Pane e Vino's we were seated immediately. Our table was decorated for our celebration, however, the table wasn't in a very good section of the restaurant. We asked if we could be moved to a better table and the hostess was very gracious and did so right away! Not only did she move us to a better table but she moved our decorations as well! The food was yummy, I got the chicken parm with fusilli as did my friend, my husband got the veal parm with fusilli and my friend's husband got fusilli with meatballs, everyone was very happy with their meal and we all decided we would go back to Pane e Vino's and try some of their other menu selections!
October 11, 2014|Wendy|5|"We had a lovely dinner with 8 in our party. The booth was very comfortable with the only drawback being that it was right next to the door to the kitchen so it was a bit ""busy"". The food was excellent, wine list comprehensive, and the service was terrific. Would definitely go back and recommend to friends."

October 10, 2014|solid italian seafood restaurant|4|we ate very well both the seafood and the veggie options. excellent and large desserts. very good Italian food and delightful friendly service.
October 7, 2014|As always, Pane e Vino is perfect!|5|The staff is outstanding, the food is excellent, the atmosphere relaxed and warm. What more can one want?
October 6, 2014|business dinners|5|great place for a business dinner - always accommodating for our groups of any size.
October 6, 2014|Monday night winner|4|Hands down, Pane e Vino is the place to dine on a monday night. 50% off wine! the italian specialties are delicious, atmosphere is charming, and the service is great.
October 4, 2014|Bit of an off-night - too busy?|3|We have been here many times with generally very satisfying results. Last Saturday night was OK but not quite up to their usual high standards. It was typically very busy but they were also serving a party next door. The beef chef's special was a bit oversold - good, not great. However, we will likely be back for another try given their excellent track record. The restaurants along Federal Hill set the bar high.
October 4, 2014|A 5-star experience!|5|Excellent service, food and wine selection. Some different martini selections as well. Perfect spot for a couple or small group celebrating a special occasion.
October 3, 2014|Never disappoints|5|Our dinner was excellent. Only complaint was a very loud table nearby. We had a lovely table and the lobster ravioli was out of this world!
October 1, 2014|Pleasant evening|4|Of the restaurants on Atwells Ave. where we have eaten, this was one of the best. We had knowledgable French guests who found the wine choices very good.

September 27, 2014|good time|4|Everything was good, no complaints. Not wowed by the food but it was good.
September 27, 2014|Terrific|5|The food at Pane e Vino is amazing!! Our server, Kevin, was top notch...friendly and attentive, but not intrusive. The only downside is that it is a small, compact venue with activity swirling around you. It can seem a tad 'hectic', rather than relaxing. But, again, the food and service are the best!!!
September 26, 2014|Excellent Gem|5|My parents and I really enjoyed the restaurant, everything about it was great! We were especially impressed with our server and the other staff. My mother is gluten intolerant and they were all helpful and understanding! We would suggest it to any person!
September 24, 2014|I must have missed something!|2|My family and I went Pane E Vino on a Wednesday and they had a very nice crowd. Our waitress who was very nice, was stretched to a point where she couldn't provide appropriate service. As far as the food goes I would have to say the portion size is huge for my taste but that is how our group felt. The food was mediocre at best. My wife had a shrimp dish and the shrimp were over cooked. I had gnocchi which are supposedly to be light pillows of potato dumplings, instead they were heavy lead balls. My son had rigatoni with sausage, meatballs,and fresh ricotta. The meatballs were dry and had no taste, the saussage was awful. There has to be better Italian food out there but this is definitely not place for good Italian or Foodies.
September 24, 2014|Great restaurant.|5|A gem within the Providence food district. Great food and ambiance. Always a great meal and great service.
September 22, 2014|Perfect!|5|Brought my relatives from the west coast for a special dinner. They LOVED it! Wine was 50% off (Monday night) so that was a treat. Would highly recommend. If you haven't tried Pane E Vino, you should.
September 20, 2014|Wonderful|4|The food was delicious, the service wonderful. We had the bruschetta with heirloom tomatoes, the lobster pasta with cream sauce and ravioli. All of it awesome. Our waitress was exceptional and I loved the fact that as busy as it was all of the wait staff were happy and smiling and welcoming. Great place. I would highly recommend it.
September 20, 2014|not a place for couples|2|My wife and i went here for her bday dinner and we were seated next at a table for eight sharing the space with a reunion group of six LOUD people. Not the intimate dinner we were seeking. Kinda ruined the food, cocktails ambience.
September 19, 2014|You're practically in Italy|5|The food is amazing - I've not had a plate here that didn't amaze me with how good it was. Most recently, I got the black ink squid fra diavolo and my boyfriend got the veal milanese. Both were absolutely delicious. The table was small and tucked away in the back of the restaurant, and we were very close to the couple sitting next to us (so close that when the waitress was taking our order, she was half-leaning on the guy at the table next to us haha... kind of awkward, but didn't ruin the evening. it's understood theres finite available space to work with). The wine was perfect and I appreciated the waitress opening it in front of us, realizing the cork was a bit dried out, and going to get a new bottle.
September 13, 2014|Awesome Dinner|5|My wife was extremely happy with the gluten free menu. When her food came it was awseome. Would definitely recommend this place for those gluten free. My meal was great as well. Terrific service as well.
September 12, 2014|Best in Class|5|If you're looking for the finest quality authentic Italian food in Providence - or maybe even the East Coast, you've found it here. The quality of both food and service is simply outstanding. Our favorite restaurant in Providence.
September 9, 2014|Outstanding!|5|Had a positive experience dining at Pane e Vino for the first time while hosting a visiting job applicant. The request for a table toward a quieter area of the restaurant via Opentable app was granted and the service was outstanding. The waitress helped to customize our dining with wine selection and entree recommendations that were perfect for our preferences. Enjoyed the calamari and beef carpaccio, and dinner with veal saltimbocca and seafood risotto. Dessert with tiramisu and sorbet. Service was unhurried and thoughtful, well paced. Delicious food, excellent wine, and high-level service made for an outstanding meal and left the right impression for my guest's visit to Providence.
September 7, 2014|The food was fabulous, perfectly prepare...|5|The food was fabulous, perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. We will be returning soon.
Dined on September 5, 2014|Enjoyable Experience|5|I loved that they had several meals that are gluten free and even gluten free rolls they will bring out for you. I really love Italian food and they have a fantastic menu. Coming from out of state it was a wonderful experience to be able to eat gluten free Italian.
September 4, 2014|Wonderful restaurant. I would definitely...|4|Wonderful restaurant. I would definitely go back. We even bought a gift certificate for a friend!
September 1, 2014|Pane e Vino|3|I was a little disappointed with the food at Pane e Vino. I had heard it was very good, but my experience was that it was average. I did think the service was exceptional.
September 1, 2014|A Great Find.|5|The intimate setting, the professional and knowledgeable staff, the beautiful plating of the incredibly delicious food makes Pane e Vino Providence a favorite spot that we have and will return to again and again.
August 31, 2014|Good but not great!|4|They were very busy the night we dined there. Had to wait twenty minutes past our reservation time but no big deal for me. Service was good once we were seated. Food was good but not memerable. Calamari was chewy and pastas were a bit too al dente. My lamb chops were quite good. My business partners said they would not eat there again but I would give them another chance. quaint restaurant and very nice people.
August 31, 2014|A Great Find|4|We have tried many Providence Italian restaurants and found this one by chance one Sunday. The whole staff is friendly and knowledgable. The menu has a lot of options to choose from,each one unique and delicious. Food presentation was lovely and the wait staffs timing was perfect. An excellent choice of wines are available. The decor is beautiful throughout the restaurant. I am anxious to return and sample more of the delicious options from the menu.
August 30, 2014|Best of Federal Hill|5|This was our second time @ Pane e Vino. The food again was outstanding (I cant believe I ate the whole thing), the specialty drinks are fun (try the Sin & Tonic). Our reservation was timely and we will be back.
August 27, 2014|Classic & Delicious Italian|4|My husband and I were visiting from out of town so we based our decision to eat here based on the OpenTable reviews. Pane e Vino did not disappoint. Our server was attentive, but not overbearing. I had the evening's special app - fried zucchini flowers stuffed with locally-made ricotta cheese - my entree, the Tagliatelle w/ Porcini Mushrooms. My husband enjoyed the Bruschetta app and Mushroom Chicken. The pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly. Overall, a very nice meal. I would recommend it.
August 26, 2014|Bread & Wine|5|Great restaurant which adds a touch of their own style to what they make. That being said, the meals are all familiar but have a bit of something else. For instance, if you ever go, try the bread pudding. It has a crusty top and is not the least bit mushy. Sat in the back which was very quiet. There is a porch area which looks nice. It was my wife's birthday and they had a card on the table waiting for her and some simple decorations.
August 26, 2014|Superb|5|Set the reservation with a note about our 43rd wedding anniversary. Arrived to a window table sprinkled with shinny little stars and a thoughtful card for our anniversary. The entire staff is friendly, professional and attentive. From the basket of warm bread to the last sip of wine, our celebration was fun and memorable. Great drinks, fantastic wine list, scrumptious Caesar and the Fusili Napolitano was perfect. We'll be back and we'll recommend to our friends.
August 25, 2014|It was a wonderful evening spent with my...|4|It was a wonderful evening spent with my gal-pals! 5 out of 6 of us enjoyed the prix-fixe menu and as an added bonus, it was 50% off wine Monday (both bottles and glasses). Everything was delicious and our waitress was great. We would definitely go there again!

August 23, 2014|The 27th!|5|"My wife and I had a wonderful evening at Pane e Vino - Our table was ready (the restaurant was full). The table surprised us with a nice ""Happy Anniversary"" card and some stars scattered on the table. Everything was perfect. We are slow-appreciative eaters - we take our time, because, what's the rush? Our server, Allyson, matched our pace to perfection. We left on a floating cloud."

August 23, 2014|Great food!|4|Very busy Saturday night. Food was still good. Did wait a long time for it though. It would be great if every time the gluten-free person that you are eating with gets his rolls when the non-gluten person gets her rolls. It did happen at this restaurant once.
August 23, 2014|Yummmmm|5|Everything was great. We had an early reservation and it was still very crowded. We started off with the Formaggi Con Prosciutto, truffled honey is very tasty! The bread they brought out was great but the olive oil tasted old (the only negative of the night). I had the black squid ink with lobster fra diavolo. Be forewarned, this is VERY SPICY. My husband had the risotto frutti de mare, which was amazing as well. We were far too full for dessert but walked down the hill for the live music and walked around. Lovely evening, fantastic meal.
August 23, 2014|Went for the 1st time 8/23/2014.  The ta...|2|Went for the 1st time 8/23/2014. The table we sat at had no room to move and it was by the kitchen. The entree was chewy pasta along with a very bland sauce. I had at most four bites and could not eat anymore. For my taste, horrible food. Can't believe they have gotten such great reviews. I will not be back.
August 22, 2014|Great Italian food|4|I'm half Italian and very picky when it comes to food, but Pane&Vino really was an outstanding choice for a dinner out. Truly Italian.
August 21, 2014|annual birthday dinner|5|As usual food and service was great. Only disappointment was that the restaurant no longer carries my favorite wine. The server recommended a lovely substitute which I enjoyed. Kudos to the chef. I very much enjoy dining there
August 17, 2014|Delicious food, cozy atmosphere|5|Six of us who all appreciate good food and have been to Italy found the meals excellent. Squid linguine with lobster was a standout. Bolognese well done, gnocchi smothered in cheese yummy, meatballs and sausage very good. Veal chop Parmesan delicious though chop a bit thin. Beet salad marvelous combo with goat cheese, excellent dressing and candied walnuts. Desserts generous in size and masterful. Waitress, Cassandra, upbeat and helpful, especially with the wine. Wonderful evening.
August 15, 2014|service was phenomenal|5|Arrived at the restaurant and was seated promptly. We were offered a different table that was more spacious and took advantage. We tried the caprese salad special for our appetizer and it was amazing and fresh. For our meals I ordered the gnocchi and my friend ordered your version of saltimboca. I have to start off by saying I am a gnocchi fanatic and this did was the best I have ever tasted. I was so incredibly joyed but the tender pillows in such a delicious sauce. My friend enjoyed her dish but didnt love it. We also enjoyed dessert which was definitely something to save room for. Our experience would not have been as amazing if we had not been served by our waitress. She was outstanding, very knowledgeable and so friendly.
August 14, 2014|great italian food in providence|4|was impressed with the food overall and special fried stuffed zucchini flowers
August 9, 2014|group of 8|5|Recently went with a group of 8 to Pane e Vino. We received a phone call from the manager approx 45 min before our 7:30pm reservation time to inform us that the previous large party had arrived late and our reservation was running 15-20 minutes behind. We all appreciated this call as it eliminated hanging around the restaurant waiting. We were seated at a round table, best for large group. Restaurant full to capacity and very busy. This did not interfere with service. Our server was prompt, polite, funny and efficient. All 8 raved about the food. Highly recommend
August 9, 2014|poor table at back|2|we were placed at a table near the back of the restaurant, even tho we had an early reservation!!!! not impressed, felt like a cafeteria!!!
August 8, 2014|Reminiscent of Living in Napoli|5|Food and Wines reminded me of the great meals we used to have during four years of living in Southern Italy. Have sampled many Federal Hill restaurants but we always return to Pane e Vino when we need a taste of the real thing. Everyone in our party tried the $22.50 Prix Fixe special and no one was disappointed. The charcuterie appetizer was delicious and plenty for our group of four.
August 5, 2014|Just OK|3|Perhaps it was what we ordered but the food was just OK. In the past we thought the food was better. The best salad was swimming in dressing. The tables are VERY close together. A group next to us was so loud we could barely talk. I do't think we will be back. togq
August 3, 2014|One of our favoritess|5|Food outstanding - and great wine list. Really like the early Trattoria menu.
August 2, 2014|Great food and atmosphere|4|Pane e Vino is a wonderful small restaurant with an outstanding staff and delicious food. We went with our 2 teenage children and all got something different - we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The place was filled (we had reservations) and it's good to see a great, small place do well.
August 1, 2014|Great first visit to Federal Hill|5|We are from the Boston area and never had been to Federal Hill. After doing some research we found Pane e Vino and we were so glad we did. The people are very nice, the atmosphere is comfortably Italian country charming and all od our food was excellent. I had the studded zucchini app and my husband had the Caesar. Both were excellent. Then we both were attracted to the bone-in Veal Chops available and we each tried our own veal dishes - fork tender - yum the best veal ever! And they even have complementary valet parking. Go! You will not be disappointed. We're already planning a return trip!
August 1, 2014|A great Federal Hill Spot|4|This was the first time we've been to Federal Hill and we were recommended to Pane e Vino by a friend. Without having experienced any of the other many restaurants in the area, we still felt like it was a good choice. In addition to the delicious bread, we started with the house-made meatballs which were delicious as well as the Mista salad - also very good! My husband had the veal parm from the price fix menu and I had the Orecchiette and both were really good and very generous portions. We also had dessert - bread pudding and warm chocolate cake. Both were outstanding. Our service was also very good. Everyone who worked there was very pleasant. I wouldn't hesitate to return.
July 31, 2014|Yummy specials|5|We really enjoy the seasonal specials - squash blossom & gig dishes truly exceptional
July 31, 2014|Fun evening.|3|Tried to give us a poor table, plenty were available as we had arrived early. That was fixed immediately when we asked for a different table. Why restaurants do that has always puzzled me. Service was very good. Salad was excellent and so was main course. Ordered bruschetta, toast was burnt, did not eat most of it. They took it off the bill. Finished with the bread pudding, boy was that over rated by other reviewers. Had wonderful conversation with tables on both side. Overall a fun place to go and would go back again.
July 27, 2014|Cooperative Kitchen|4|As usual, great dining experience, but need to add half bottles of wine to wine selection. Some of our dinner selections were not on the menu, but kitchen obliged.
July 26, 2014|Love this restaurant!|5|We arrived at Pane e Vino on Saturday night at 5:30 for a 6:00 reservation and they were able to seat us. Everything was AWESOME!! From the service, to the food, to the restaurant itself. My husband ordered a dish with fusilli, sausage and meatballs and he absolutely loved it. Our friend got the spinach salad and lobster raviolis which she said was great. Her husband got the meatball appetizer and the same dish as my husband and he loved his as well. I got the chicken parm and it was excellent (two huge pieces of chicken). The portions were good and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant!!
July 19, 2014|Top notch!|5|Food and Staff were on point! Was our first time dining here as we dine quite often on Federal Hill and stumbled across this fine restaurant. We enjoyed the ambiance and friendly staff along with our amazing food!
July 19, 2014|Great service|4|We arrived early for our reservation on a busy Saturday night, but the restaurant was ready for us and very accommodating and attentive. The service staff was helpful with the menu items and the food portions were large and delicious.
July 18, 2014|Service and Food|5|The waitress Allyson always does a terrific job as she is attentive and knowledgeable. The authentic Italian food never disappoints!
July 14, 2014|Outstandig service honest wine list|4|Two minutes after we sat down, we managed to spill, not one but, two glasses of ice water. the young lady serving us and a young man rushed to our table and quickly changed the whole table cloth and wiped the floor. Outstanding! the bread was very good with flavorful olive oil and olives; the zucchini flowers were great! The pastas lacked flavor. For some reason it's difficult to execute pasta Amatriciana outside of Italy. the wine list is very honest. On Monday night with 1/2 price on bottles of wine, it came to less than what it retailed for. Looking forward to going back next time we're in town.
July 13, 2014|Traditional italian food.|4|Traditional plates just like we (Italians) make at home. Food and ingredients were very good. Nice staff and great service. If you want to experience a very good italian home cooked meal, you must try Pane e Vino!
July 12, 2014|Amazing!|5|We were a party of 5 and every dish we ordered was wonderful!! I had the fuscilli with meatballs and I was not disappointed. Do yourself a favor and book a reservation for this restaurant; I guaranee you will not be disappointed!
Dined on July 12, 2014|Good food, excellent service|4|Pane e Vino is another gem in Providence's Federal Hill. Four of us had dinner there recently and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and, in particular the service. While we enjoyed all of our meal highlights were the Beef Carpaccio, Pan Fried Calamari, Roasted Beet Salad, the Bone-in Veal Chop and the Swiss Chard and Ricotta Ravioli. The atmosphere and ambience was delightful, and while crowded on a Saturday night, not too loud. We were very impressed with our server, Amanda, who displayed great knowledge of the wines and the menu and worked with each of our tastes to select the right wines for our main courses. A very enjoyable evening.
July 11, 2014|INCREDIBLE MEAL|5|It was Restaurant Week and it was very busy, but EVERYTHING WAS INCREDIBLE, down to the smallest details like the olive oil and bread. And the food was some of the best in Providence. If you are in town, you must eat here. If you feel like taking a trip, it is well worth the travel.
July 9, 2014|So So|3|Was recommended and being Italian food was just so-so. Wait staff very slow to come around. Too busy very rushed.
July 9, 2014|Rustic Italian|4|Fabulous food, moderate prices and a comfortable atmosphere make Pane & Vino a winner!

July 6, 2014|Outstanding|5|My hubby and I dined at Pane e Zvino to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our server, Amanda, was pleasant, informative, efficient. Hubby had shrimp pesto pasta dish, which he said was wonderful. I ordered chicken scallopine with long- stemmed artichokes and potatofontina cake. All delicious! I like, too, the selection of breads and the tasty olives which accompanied them. We will return!
July 5, 2014|Perfect updated Italian|5|We enjoyed a wonderful meal ! Service was impeccable Food fabulous!

June 21, 2014|This first-timer would return|4|There were four of us that went to dinner on a Saturday night. We had never been and all of us enjoyed our food. The waitress was great. I was asking questions about some of the chicken entrees and she suggested an off-menu option which was exactly what I was looking for. I didn't find it too loud in there - conversation was at a comfortable level. Lighting was not bright, but not dark enough that I couldn't read the menu. A couple of cons - The mixed drinks we a little weak. We arrived about 10 minutes late and had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table - so we weren't seated for at least 30 minutes after our reservation time.
June 19, 2014|Consistently Awesome|5|"While I am not prone to visit the same restaurant very often, Pane y Vino has managed to lure me in time after time. Whether with family, friends, or business associates, it is now my go to place. The ambience, food, and service are second to none. I feel like I'm back in Rome when I walk in and I always ""eat with pleasure""."
June 17, 2014|Providence gem|5|Always get great food and wine at reasonable prices with great staff.

June 17, 2014|GF diamond!|5|I received a gift card for this great restaurant, and my wife and i went there for our 19th wedding anniversary. I have Celliac and require gluten free food, and they did not disappoint. Their GF dinner rolls were outstanding, and their GF food was excellent! We had great service, they were friendly and professional, and the evening was magical. And don't forget the GF cheesecake!! My wife and I will be back, and will tell our friends!
June 15, 2014|Loud children|5|Children next to is extremely loud and had napkins on heir heads and running through the restaurant. Parents thought is was cute. NOT!
June 14, 2014|The food was very good . I had lobster r...|2|The food was very good . I had lobster ravioli. The sauce was delicious but....I ordered a Cosmo. I have an allergy to limes which I informed my waited of immediatly. I told him no lime or lime juice please. I received my drink and took a small sip and sure enough, it was so sour and had lime juice in it. This could have been a very serious problem. Luckily, I only took a small sip and ended up with a coughing fit and a sore throat. I informed the waiter and he ordered a new one. I watched the bartender make it but was shocked when I tasted it. It tasted of coconut. Clearly the shaker was not properly washed after the last drink.
June 14, 2014|One of Best on Federal Hill|3|I've eaten at Pane e Vino many times. I thought the food yesterday was mediocre compared to usual.
June 14, 2014|Lovely restaurant and attentive service....|3|Lovely restaurant and attentive service. Food beautifully presented. Here's the BUT. I tend to add salt to my food and this food was so salty from the salad to the 2 main dishes we shared. I don't think I've ever eaten such salty Italian food!
June 13, 2014|Not so great|2|"Went here Friday with six people to celebrate my wife's birthday. Haven't been here for 4 years, so I checked on line for reviews. A lot said great food & service. So made the reservations and off we were. Waited for the table for 20 minutes , no big deal. Once seated the waitress had our drink order and things were looking good. The food arrived and we all became very quiet, though I did ask everyone about their dish. It went from just OK to terrible. So who is eating here thinking the food is ""great"", NOT. My dish was their new scallop risotto , 3 scallops over a ice cream scoop of not so good risotto, $26.00. Very disappointed. I will stick to Andino's and Siena from now on, always great."
June 10, 2014|Good in a sea of great|3|My scallops and risotto were very good good. My guest's chicken saltimbocca was also nice, though with more of a red sauce than we've typically been familiar with. Overall, nice experience and I'd return. Probably put on my lunch list, however, since the options are so many.
June 9, 2014|Consistence in excellence|5|WE have dined often here and will continue as the price is amazing and the MOnday night 1/2 price wine offering is so awesome. It never fails to be satisfying with great courses from appetizers to desserts.
June 5, 2014|Great night!|5|Love Pane e Vino especially after a wine tasting at Gasbarro's. Especially enjoyed affumicato di provolo - thank you for making it for us when it wasn't on the menu. Look forward to returning. Excellent service! Loved the Campari and Aperol spritzs.
June 5, 2014|Allison our waitress|5|Made the evening delicious and fun. The food was excellent and so was the service. Noisy but not too bad in a week night.
June 4, 2014|Special occasion |4|We always love dining at pane e vino as the food is delicious and service excellent. The menu provided some new entrees. I had the grilled artichoke salad and lamb shank with ravioli and spinach. Delicious! My husband had the arugula salad with a seafood risotto that he enjoyed.
June 4, 2014|Consistently good!|5|I brought a group of friends here this week and we had a fantastic time. Food was wonderful as it always is.
June 2, 2014|A good evening. |4|Service from Ann was exceptionally good. Quiet, intimate, softly lit. Misto salad was very great with white Balsamic dressing. It will be ordered again! Veal with artichokes, wine and lemon and seafood risotto both were very good. Risotto leftovers were even good the next day! Only negative was that the food was VERY strongly flavored. If you prefer subtle flavoring, you should be aware.
June 2, 2014|EXCELLENT CUISINE!|5|LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! FOOD IS FANTASTIC! MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT! THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE ANY EVENT YOU ARE CELEBRATING SPECIAL!
May 31, 2014|Just keeps getting better|5|Dinner was outstanding. I had the duck and my husband had the gulf shrimp and both dishes were excellent! They never disappoint!
May 31, 2014|May 31 2014|5|I have been to Pane e Vino many times and the food and service has always been fantastic. My favorite dish is the bone-in veal chop parmigiana. Calamari is my favorite appetizer. Great wine list. Service is next to none.
May 30, 2014|Delectable Dishes|5|Very fresh food with homegrown Italian flare.Very personable staff.
May 29, 2014|Felt rushed|3|On a Thursday night with the restaurant half full our server rushed us through our dinner. This was a special occasion for us seeing that it was my girlfriends birthday. We were seated by 6 30 and by 7 00 we already had our entrees in front of us after we ordered appetizers and a bottle of wine. The food was excellent they make a great dish of rebe e salsiccia con orecheitte.

Excellent! this describes our experience - the Server was pleasant, attentive, not intrusive - in essence, she was professional ... the food was excellent - perfectly cooked and prepared ... nicely presented ... ah, the wine - so perfect .... and, we also appreciated and took advantage of the 1/2 price Mondays ... of course, this added to our enjoyment .... definitely a return trip is called for! Patricia
May 25, 2014|Wonderful celebratory meal|5|Our meal was wonderful--delicious food, terrific (and friendly service). We had a very nice table in a small room--so quiet enough for conversation. Our favorite Providence restaurant.
May 25, 2014|Great Italian to Celebrate|5|Came with 4 adult kids & my wife to celebrate college graduation. Food is outstanding! Had the Spinach salad with crispy pancetta: so different and so good! One son had the Caesar salad with incredibly fresh and very tasty anchovies that he shared with Dad. One son & I special ordered Black Squid Ink Linguine Fra Diavolo substituting shrimp for the lobster & waitress was happy to accommodate. So delicious! My other son got the Fusilli alla Bolognese with veal that he absolutely devoured, so good! Great wine selection and waitress was willing to let me taste test 2 wines I was considering, nice touch. Daughter the mostly vegetarian, had Bucatini all‚Äô Amatriciana. Arguably one of the best restaurants certainly Italian, in the city. Worth it!
May 24, 2014|Graduation Weekend|5|Ate with three generations to celebrate Brown graduation. Great choice. Everyone loved it.
May 24, 2014|Excellent food|5|Much better food compared to other (overrated) restaurants in the area
May 23, 2014|The Best on Fed Hill!|5|We've been visiting our daughter at college for 4 years in Providence and this was our first visit to Pane e Vino - wish we had found it sooner! Our table was ready at our reservation time, the service was outstanding and the food was excellent! Some of the dishes we had - halibut that was cooked to perfection and the best lasagna EVER with huge portions! If I ever visit Providence again, I will definitely return to Pane e Vino!
May 19, 2014|Monday night Gem|5|We do a lot of company dinners and customer entertainment here. Excellent Italian food, friendly and attentive wait staff and 1/2 price wine on Monday - what's not to love!
Dined on May 19, 2014|Gem for anyone with Celiac Sprue|5|By far the best Gluten Free dinning on Federal Hill. Food was outstanding. Server (Alyson) was extremely knowledgable, able to make great recommendations, and could answer any questions we had. This is a must stop for anyone with Celiac Sprue. And I would recommend taking any guests you may have to Pane e Vino.
May 17, 2014|Consistent High Quality|4|I have been to Pane e Vino multiple times and they never disappoint. Food quality is always excellent. The space is a little cramped, which makes the place feel more crowded than it should. Barring a tempting special, my go to entree is the veal chop parmesean. It is always outstanding and for Federal Hill is reasonably priced.
May 17, 2014|Good but expensive|4|service was great, food was good, however very pricy for what you get.
May 11, 2014|Mothers Day|5|Everything was excellent! One flaw was that the windows were open. and people outside the restaurant were smoking. That put a damper on the day. I will go back because this was not the 1st time dining there, and the food and service is always top notch.
May 8, 2014|sweet sixteen|4|Celebrated my daughters birthday. Table we requested by the window was not available, we set at another table that was wonderfully decorated with birthday confetti. Dinner selections was wonderful., appetizers were great. My risotto was lacking in flavor. It was removed from my bill. Our server was just ok. Overall highly recommend it for great ambiance.
May 8, 2014|Excellent Feast!|5|Pane e Vino once again proved itself stellar as a principle dining location on Federal Hill in Providence. Brought a group to celebrate the end of the academic year and very special time was experienced by all! From our waitress greeting us to the inventive drinks and cuisine all made our gathering one to remember! Thank you Pane e Vino for demonstrating how warm, welcoming, and taken care of guests can be at your establishment!
May 5, 2014|always wonderful|5|This has been one of our favorite spots ever since they opened. we will keep coming back. food and service is always top notch
May 3, 2014|Awesome!|5|We usually frequent Siena when dining in Providence but we tried Pane e Vino this time. I have to say, the seared sea scollops over risotto has to be one on the best dishes I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. The citric glaze added just the right flavors making it a complex yet subtle dish. I'd recommend highly. Only downside is the limited wine by the glass options, expecially for whites. For a place whose name translates literally to Bread & Wine, I would have expected better offerings but this is not a dealbreaker as the food is spectacular and their full bottle options are OK. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings.
May 2, 2014|A great find!|5|Just visiting Providence for the day and read through some reviews on restaurants. Chose Pane e Vino given the consensus of OpenTable reviews. Wonderfully surprised! Charming atmosphere. Food that was very well prepared and tastily seasoned. Service was pleasant and efficient. Certainly would revisit if I am back in the Providence area.
May 2, 2014|Not as good as usual|4|We love Pane e Vino and have been many times. this time one of our party ordered the Rack of Lamb special ($32), he ordered the lamb medium and it came out very well done, dry and inedible. He sent it back and they remade it and the lamb chops came back raw. Sent back again and when they came back one of them was cooked but the other still raw. The rest of our party was super-happy as usual with our meals (Eggplant Parm and Veal Chop) but it was disappointing. They did send us over complimentary Lemoncellos. I still give it a 4 overall because this is really the first time we've had a problem and it is one of our favorite restaurants.
April 30, 2014|Awesome Food|5|The food was cooked to perfection, and well seasoned. The bartender was new, but delightful. Needs a d√©cor upgrade!
April 28, 2014|Good variety and specials on menu.  Ever...|5|Good variety and specials on menu. Everything from appetizer to dessert scrumptious.
April 26, 2014|Wonderful menu selections!|5|All menu items looked mouth watering! We loved the atmosphere, warm welcome and quality service from start to finish...Cocktails...appetizers...salads...entrees...desserts...and coffee!
April 23, 2014|Fantastico!|5|Pane e Vino is simply one of the best kept secrets on the hill. I have entertained family, friends, and business associates here. The food is so good, atmosphere is intimate and we have always had great servers. Thank You!
April 20, 2014|Mangia bene!!|5|Great Italian food with a great atmosphere and a very helpful and friendly staff! What could be better??
April 18, 2014|Great Italian on Federal Hill |5|Wonderful Italian restaurant with a romantic atmosphere and delicious food! I knew there would be good Italian food on Federal Hill, but was still pleasantly surprised. To start, we split a mista salad - a very generous portion, which they brought out on two plates for us. It had a nice, light vinaigrette dressing. For mains, we had the fusilli al ragu napoletano with sausage, meatballs, and ricotta cheese. The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly and had a nice chewy texture, and the meatballs were delicious. We also had the orecchiette alle cime di rapa, one of my favorite pasta dishes and Pane e Vino does a great job with it.
April 13, 2014|Great dinner, great vibe|4|Came here with friends from out of town who were exhausted after a weekend of house hunting. Got a warm welcome from start to finish, including valet, hostess, GM, and waitress(es). Nice relaxed vibe, not stuffy at all. LOVED my baby artichoke salad, as well as my poached halibut special. Our waitress was a bit overtaxed, though, and most of our drinks orders needed at least one or two gentle reminders before they made it to our table. Nevertheless, we were treated very well (despite shamelessly camping out at the table for at least an hour longer than is really customary). Overall, I was very happy with the whole experience.
April 12, 2014|Great experience |4|The food was very good and the service was excellent. We attended celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary and the guests of honor were very pleased.
April 9, 2014|The food was very good, and|4|The food was very good, and the service was great.
April 5, 2014|Delicious Italian|5|I was visiting Providence for a work conference. We had a group of 10. Food and service was wonderful !!!
April 5, 2014|Cuisine|5|The food at Pane Vino is consistently excellent. The dishes are well prepared & presented. It is quality Italian food at reasonable prices. The wine list is very good & the half off wines on Mondays cannot be beat. Try the fusilli pasta with wagu sausage & kobe beef meatballs. The dallop of Ricotta rounds out the dish. End the meal with the bread pudding & you will be extremely satisfied.
April 4, 2014|Love Pane √® Vino|5|Great food and great wine. The service was excellent. Great meal to accompany a Gasbarro's wine tasting!
April 4, 2014|Delicioso!|5|We were 2 couples out for dinner and everyone loved their meals. Zuppa d'pesce was to die for!
March 30, 2014|As good as always|5|We both had the trattoria menu which provided the right mix of appetizers, entrees and desserts for a set price which was very reasonable. Food was outstanding. Great service. This was a Sunday nite and frankly alot easier to deal with then the weekends. No wait to be seated which can sometimes be an issue even with a reservation on Friday or Saturday.
March 27, 2014|Quaint, Classic Italian|4|Great food and atmosphere...felt private but not cramped; old school but not old and dingy-great and friendly service from everyone!
March 22, 2014|True Italian Food|4|One of my favorites on Federal Hill. The Frutti de Mar was excellent. Tasted just like my 85 year old Italian grandmother. Nice wine, great bread served with olive oil and a side of olives. Will always return for bowl of pasta when I can't get home to see my grandmother.
March 21, 2014|Great Italian Food|5|Pane e Vino serves AUTHENTIC Italian cuisine (don't expect the Olive Garden). They have an awesome wine menu as well. This place is a gem!
March 20, 2014|A fabulous find on Federal Hill|5|From the entrees to the dessert, the crusted bread to the classic cannoli, it was a fabulous meal. Our server Alex expertly ushered us through a meal that helped make this trip to Providence one we will not forget. Without reservation, the best meal we've had on Atwell Street!! And by the way, we reserved our table on OpenTable. What could be easier!!
March 15, 2014|family get together|5|This place was wonderful we could hear each other the food was great the waiter wonderful very we would all go again together or separate
March 14, 2014|Good food. Good service. Good|4|Good food. Good service. Good time. Always a pleasure.
March 13, 2014|obnoxious bar crowd|3|"good food, waitress was helpful, but atmosphere was poor with bar crowd dropping ""F-bombs"" all over the place."
March 1, 2014|Felt rushed|3|I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while. I was a bit disappointed. Appetizer portions were very small though highly priced. Dinner was good but nothing exceptional. The staff was very friendly however I felt we were very rushed. We had no sooner ordered appetizers and our waiter wanted to take our food order. Dishes were being cleared the second anyone finished eating and the bill was on the table the minute dessert and coffee were ordered. For the amount of money spent, I would have liked to have had a more leisurely dinner.
March 1, 2014|Perfect for Our Palates|5|Every facet of our recent (1st) experience here was superb other than a slight delay re: drinks. Free valet parking is a HUGE plus in this bustling neighborhood. Our request for swift service was honored (since we were enroute to a Mardi Gras ball!) The broad, well-priced menu, great drinks, (great Malbec), beautifully prepared, hot, well-presented & nicely served food were all tops. Ambiance is cozy; we sat near a toasty fireplace - perfect experience which we hope to repeat!
February 26, 2014|Such a great experience|5|Recently had dinner at Pane Vino to celebrate my daughters birthday. Everything from Eddie the valet to Amanda our server was out of this world! We sat in front of the fire place so cozy and warm for a winter night. Our table was decorated for my daughters birthday along with a card signed by the staff. Nice touch! Then there was the food...we started with the calamari. Tender and tasteful. Also had the tomato soup. Out of this world! Our server Amanda was super friendly, professional and energetic. I had the the duck. This goes highly recommended. Crisp and flavorful. The fig ravioli were to die for. The night ended with the servers singing to my daughter. Very special evening! Everything was fantastic. We will be back for sure!
February 22, 2014|Great place to meet friends,|4|Great place to meet friends, enjoy a relaxed atmosphere and have a delicious dinner. The menu was varied‚Ä¶ so many choices. We all tried different entree's so we could taste more than one dish. Each dish was excellent that it was hard to chose a favorite. Dessert was sinful! Best way to celebrate special occasion!
February 22, 2014|Great Food|4|Great Italian food at Pane e Vino on Federal Hill. Perhaps the best I've eaten there. Large portions too. Quick valet parking.
February 22, 2014|Poor Management|1|"We have eaten here before and have had mixed experiences. Twice we have had unacceptable meals removed from our bill. We were told it would be ""just a few minutes"" when we arrived for our reservation. After forty minutes we were led to a 18"" wide table against the wall. The manager said ""sorry for the wait"". My chicken was so tough it was difficult to cut with a cerrated knife. Finally the manager came to our table and quite loudly told us we had to wait because another party didn't leave. It was embarrassing. Amazingly while we were waiting there were at least four other empty tables that remained empty for our entire wait. It's not consistently good food and the management is poor so we will cross this one off of our list."
February 22, 2014|outstanding menu|5|The menu had an abundance of different items to choose from and the presentation of the food was to be admirable. Beside the food was the outstanding attention and service from the waitress.
February 22, 2014|Try me|4|Easy access,attentive service, adequate menu,good food add up to a nice evening.
February 21, 2014|Very nice|5|Small, quaint, an excellent find among the myriad restaurants on Federal Hill. The food and the service were first class - a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
Dined on February 19, 2014|Always A Favorite|5|"Whenever I have customers coming in from out of town that want good, Italian food, I always suggest Pane E Vino! I was born on Vinton Street and I love to tell all the stories associated with Federal Hill. You would be surprised home many people of heard of, ""Da Hill!"".. Great tasing food, great presentation, excellent wine list, outstanding service (our server was fantastic) all at reasonable prices!! Pane E Vino can hold it's own against some of the great restaurants in New York!!!"
February 15, 2014|Nice place, great food.|4|My wife and I enjoyed going here. The food is very good and the place is nice and romantic like. The only issue is service, it's slow going. We would eat here again as the food was great.
February 14, 2014|Another Atwells ave gem.|5|Excellent all around is what I would have to say about this establishment. The food is outstanding. Service is very good. They have a very wine list. An all around A plus.
February 14, 2014|disappointed|2|was looking forward to eating there and was disappointed
February 13, 2014|Excellent food and service|5|Took my girlfriend for dinner and we had a great experience. The food was excellent and the service was phenomenal.
February 8, 2014|Not worth trying at all.|2|Don't waste your time and money. From the moment we arrived. We had a 8:30 reservation only to be seated at 9:10. Meanwhile there were plenty of available empty tables in the place. Finally get seated only to be seated by the window which was so drafty that we could not even take our coats off. Food was just O.K definitely NOT Federal Hill worthy.
February 1, 2014|Always a great experience!|5|We have been to Pane e Vino probably 10 times in the last several years and have NEVER had a bad meal, drink or server! I recommend this restaurant to all my friends!
February 1, 2014|Excellent|4|Not our first time dining at Pane E Vino but it was excellent. Service was great and food excellent.
January 31, 2014|Best Bread Pudding I have ever had.|5|From Appetizer to dessert everyones meal was superb!!! Nice for a change..
January 26, 2014|Pane e Vino was delightful|5|This was our first time to Pane e Vino. It will not be our last. Great service from a clearly knowledgeable waiter who made great suggestion for food and wine. Excellent food wonderfully prepared and served. What more could one ask for. I had requested a table ina quiet spot as one of our guests has trouble speaking. The request was fulfilled.
January 25, 2014|Best Chilean sea bass|5|Fabulous dinner, so many great choices. Dessert was an almond delight topped with espresso, outrageous, can't wait to go back.
January 25, 2014|Always enjoyable|5|Pane e Vino is worth the trip and, if you don't have reservations, worth the wait. Food is superb, wait staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere makes you feel at home. It's a bit further down Federal Hill from most of the restaurants, but the free valet parking assures you of not having to worry about parking. We will be returning for sure.
January 25, 2014|Gluten Free Gem|4|For those with celiac disease, having a well prepared pasta based Italian dinner at a classy restaurant can only be described as a real treat. No longer suffer through eating plain chicken when the rest of the table is ordering yummy pasta dishes. The dishes baked in the clay pots are the best and should not be missed. They even big you fresh made GF rolls. And if you want desert they have a GF cheesecake. Gluten free Italian at its best!
January 25, 2014|Nice Night out|4|All the food and wine we ordered was great, and the service was wonderful. Complimentary valet parking was a wonderful surprise. The only (very minor) issue was the strawberry that came with my dessert was frozen which was a bit of a shock when I bit into it.
January 24, 2014|One of the best on Federal Hill|4|"We have been to Pane many times but brought friends for their first time. We shared an Antipasto Misto for the table ($24). Entrees were very good. I had the veal parm, which is a veal chop on the bone, pounded out and breaded, Other entrees were the lobster ravioli and chicken piccata. We ordered three desserts, We each had a glass of wine. The wine list is nice with a lot of Italian choices but my wife's Riesling was a pretty pedestrian ""Cavit"". Service was good - not outstanding. Total with tip came to $245 for four people. That could easily have jumped up to $300 with another glass of wine. We have been dining on ""the hill"" for 40 years. Pane and Siena, across the street, are the two best choices for fine dining."
January 24, 2014|Best Italian Cuisine|5|Never disappointed when we dine at this restaurant. The food is superb and excellent presentation.
January 19, 2014|Wonderful Evening|5|We celebrated a special anniversary and wanted a new place to go. This was perfect....will definitely return. Staff were attentive and always checked back to see that everything was fine. Food was special and delicious. Love..love..love!
January 18, 2014|Excellent in every aspect|5|Our family went to Pane e Vino as a special occasion and we immensely enjoyed our dinner. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was ready to tell us what our vegan daughter could enjoy. They were accomodating and prepared an appetizer that she loved. It is easy to spend a lot on alcohol.
January 17, 2014|Fantastic Food!|5|"I am a very picky critic when it comes from Italian food. Pane e Vino was the BEST gnocchii and Calamari I've ever had. This will be my new ""Go TO"" on the Hill!"
January 17, 2014|Just okay|3|We did this for restaurant week and it was good but nothing special. There are definitely other restaurants I would do again before going back here.
January 15, 2014|Mezzo mezzo|2|Have eaten here three times. The first two were excellent. This most recent visit, during restaurant week, was very disappointing. Celebrated a birthday occasion with a party of 6, 4 of whom had the prix fixe selections. None were very happy with the food - Salt cod over-cooked and drenched in unimpressive tomato sauce, a mediocre chicken with prosciutto and melon, and disappointing tiramisu. Those who ordered off the regular menu did a little better, but no one was particularly excited by the meal. Service was not great - Serving prosecco in wine glasses as an example‚Ä¶ but anyway, a disappointing meal. While not horrible, I would say the meal might have been acceptable in a typical chain establishment at a much lower price.
January 15, 2014|As always: fabulous food and|5|As always: fabulous food and generous restaurant week menu (many choices, just just a few and no skimpy portions here!). Service is friendly and attentive without being intrusive. A wonderful experience as always-a favorite special occasion restaurant for me and my husband.
January 15, 2014|Great innovative home style|5|Great innovative home style Italian superb service,. great reasonable wine list very friendly for those with gluten allergies would recommend to anyone looking for up scale and hard to find favorites
January 13, 2014|Good food and half off wine on Mon|4|Food was good. A nice selection of specials and half off all wine on Monday. Service was on top of everything. Recommended.
January 11, 2014|Nice Time|4|We visited here with a group of 5. Half of the party arrived early and were seated without a problem. The other half arrived a bit late but they were still able to accommodate us without a rushed or hurried feeling. The atmosphere, food and drink were very good. The service was also very good. The have a large gluten-free menu too which my GF friend really enjoyed. Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience. While I probably would not go out of my way to make this a regular stop for us, I would not steer anyone away.
January 8, 2014|Great evening|4|My wife and I celebrated our 42nd Wedding Anniversary with close friends and cannot say enough about our experience at Pane e Vino. From the food to the ambiance to the great people we shared the evening with, our wonderful day was completed on a very high note.
December 31, 2013|Poor Flavors, Poor Food|1|Antipasti calamari was good . Ordered pastas (Tagliatelle Funghi & Tartufo Nero) - both were awful. Plates were loaded with sauce, which overwhelmed the palette. In addition to a runny sauce, neither plate had flavor as it lack a balance of basic seasonings such as salt & pepper. We did not finish neither of the pastas, but only had a few spoonfuls. Made mistake of ordering the all 3 courses at beginning, therefore, still had 1 more course. Ordered Capesante (pan seared scallops) and Parmigiana (breaded pan fried veal). Neither plate had authentic flavor characteristic of the meat choice. The scallops had no taste, no salt. The veal was swimming under a watery, saucy saucy awful ravioli sauce. Cooks should taste food before serving it.
December 31, 2013|Excellent all around.|5|An outstanding choice for anyone who appreciates good Italian food. Everything we ordered was better than expected. Service was excellent as was the atmosphere. A+++
December 31, 2013|New Year's Eve|5|We were there on New Year's Eve and expected to be crowded in and rushed so that they can use the table for someone else. Well, that never happened. There were four of us and we had a great table and were not crowded in. Our service was outstanding and we were not rushed through our meal. Our waiter did an excellent job in making us feel comfortable She was knowledgeable of all the items on the menu and did not rush us to order. The food was very good and well served. We are already talking about going back next New Year's Eve and several other times before then.
December 31, 2013|Disappointed!|1|We went for New Year's Eve. The food was bland,and it is a very noisy restaurant. We felt very rushed. We would never go back!
December 29, 2013|I shall return|5|We went here to celebrate our grown daughter's birthday. Everything about the place, and our experience was delightful. Great service, food and ambiance. I will absolutely return.
December 29, 2013|very good food and service|4|very good food and service with a lovely ambiance. Although a trifle expensive, we would return for more of their delicious offerings.
December 29, 2013|Pre PPAC dinner|5|We had a reservation for 6 for dinner before going to PPAC for a play. We were seated right away and our server was very nice and informative. She told us the specials for that evening. We chose from a trattoria menu which offered a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert for 22.00 dollars. We started with bread and olive oil and olives. We asked for shaved cheese to go along with it. The appetizers and meals were delicious and so was dessert. We had tea and left for the theatre.
December 28, 2013|A Great Dining Experience!|5|Everything was just right-the mood, the food, and the service! A friend who is a local chef recommended Pane e Vino, as you have a unique Gluten Free menu. The friends I dined with needed the gluten free menu and were delighted by the vast options you offered. From wine to desert, the entire evening was spot on!
December 28, 2013|terrific!|5|I had the duck. Wow. Marvelous. The best thing I have eaten at a Restaurant since last time we ate at Nick's on Broadway. The tiramisu was very disappointing. I lived in Italy so my standards are very high.
December 28, 2013|Simply Wonderful|5|My fourth time to Pane E Vino in the last 3-4 months. Once again, the food was delicious and the service impeccable. A gem on Federal Hill.
December 28, 2013|Absolutely Delicious!|5|It was THE BEST meal I have had on Federal Hill ever. The service was outstanding! We had a show to go to and the waitstaff made sure we were out on time! The food was hot and just so delicious! I can't wait to go back!
December 27, 2013|Providential|5|We were in providence for one night and really picked this place from open table randomly. It was frankly some of the best Italian I've eaten and would drive the hour and a half it took to get there again. I had the veal Parmesan it was excellent. My wife would drive back for the eggplant.
December 27, 2013|Must return|5|Already planning my next trip to Federal Hill for Pane e Vido. The family went to a show at PPAC, and went for dinner afterwards. They accommodated us comfortably (8 people). Food was amazing and the price was right!
December 24, 2013|Holiday help|3|I have been here numerous times and always excellent. This last visit the service was not so good, but it was a holiday so I will assume just holiday help. Waiter did not have knowledge of the menu, etc.
Dined on December 23, 2013|Gluten Free Friendly|5|Gluten free very knowledgeable, great GF pasta honored the reservation right away even though people waiting.
December 23, 2013|Consistent|4|Great food, great service and a wonderful Monday night wine special!
December 23, 2013|Went with the family the Monday|5|Went with the family the Monday before christmas with our two teenage children. We all thoroughly enjoyed it! My daughter had the lobster ravioli, my son had the chicken parm, my husband had the rigatoni with meatballs and sausage and I had the gnocchi. The food was outstanding as was the service. And, as it turned out, Mondays are 50% off wine!! It's our new favorite on federal hill and we will definitely be back soon!
December 15, 2013|fun time with friends|3|After an evening at Trinity Rep to see A Christmas Carol we headed to Pane e Vino for dinner. The staff was pleasant and attentive. The calamari was delicious! Our friends said the lobster ravioli was outstanding. My husband had one of the specials, a lamb dish which he said was good. My pasta was overcooked, not al dents but the sauce was tasty. The cannolis were enjoyed by all!
December 12, 2013|Lived up to the Hype|5|Had heard of Pane e Vino through reading the RI Monthly Best Awards issue the past few years. Less stuffy than some of its cousin restaurants on Atwells Ave. Waiter was personable and the other staff handling coats/valet service were also helpful. While I enjoyed my meal I enjoyed my dates meal even better. She had the gnocchi and it was probably one of the best gnocchi I had ever tasted. Will definitely be returning
December 11, 2013|Outstanding food.|5|The food is always outstanding. The service is very good and the wine list is very nice.
December 11, 2013|Great food, Bad table.|4|Everything was great here, except out table. Wife and I went for a birthday dinner and we we're say at a two top literally 10 inches away from another table for two already seated. You actually could not fit through the space between the tables. So a nice romantic night out turned into what's amounted for a table for four with the next table dominating our night and meal.
December 8, 2013|Excellent!!|5|My wife and I took her mother and friend there for dinner. We each ordered something different and they were all delicious. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. My mother in law and her friend were still raving about the restaurant two days later. That says everything about their experience.
December 8, 2013|A friendly place with great food|4|A warm and inviting place with excellent wait staff and a wonderful menu. The portions are as large and are flavorful. Nice selection of vine and great apitezers The duck was beautifully prepared and the bone in veal chop was delicious. The customers at the next table inquired about our entries due to the incredible presentation
November 30, 2013|Excellent!!|5|We have recently rediscovered Pane E Vino!!! We have been back a couple of times in the past month and each meal and the service have been excellent!!!
November 25, 2013|Monday night|3|The half price wine list on Mondays was a definite draw.
November 23, 2013|Foodlovers Dream|5|My wife and I had a terrific meal this past Saturday. My wife had a wonderfully prepared swordfish special accompanied by perfectly prepared potatoes and green beans. My meal was veal scallopini finished with a terrific Marsala sauce. I also had the potatoes and green beans. Prior to the meal we split an appetizer of tasty tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. For dessert we had a good raspberry cheesecake. I have to say we had a great time.
November 23, 2013|We were immediately seated|3|We were immediately seated and our server came by to take drink orders and discuss the specials. We ordered a number of apps including the stuffed figs...they were a disappointment. Bitter with little other flavor. Next were a couple of the salads, the Cesar being a fine example, but the Arugula salad had far too much lemon and was drenched in the dressing. Main courses followed a similar tack with the pastas correctly cooked but rather bland. The seafood Fra Diavolo was a particular disappointment with an almost tasteless squid ink pasta. The braised lamb shank, however was just excellent. While overall the food was good, for $400.00 for 6 I think there are other better options on Federal Hill. We will not be going back.
November 16, 2013|28th anniversary dinner|5|we came to Pane e Vino on a recommendation of a friend for our anniversary dinner, we were very please with this choice. Great atmosphere, we were seated by a window and found it very relaxing. Our waiter was very attentive and pleasant. the food was phenomenal we had the swordfish and scallops delicious! unfortunately we did not have room for dessert guess we will have to return to try again.
November 9, 2013|#1 on the Hill|5|Food and service were excellent. Staff were pleasant and accommodating while serving well prepared and ample dinners. Serving traditional dishes with excellent specials featuring local options and unusual chef creations. I'm never disappointed here and out of town guests are always impressed.
November 7, 2013|Romantic anniversary dinner|5|We had a FABULOUS anniversary dinner. There was glittery confetti on the table along with an anniversary card. We hada table by the fireplace. The Prosecco was perfect, the food was outstanding and the service was awesome. Cannot wait to go back. The fig appetizer is a favorite.
November 4, 2013|Excellent as always!|5|Every time I've been here the food, service and atmosphere is excellent! I'm have to eat gluten free, it's not a choice. Their gluten free options are absolutely delicious. Even GF rolls! I was there with a friend on a Monday night. Arrived early so it was quite but by the time we left it was very busy. Even being busy our service was excellent. Food is always delicious. I had GF Chicken Piccata and my friend had Chicken Parm. We both loved our meals. They offer a nice prix fix menu during the week. I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion.
November 3, 2013|Delicious and reasonable|5|We took advantage of the three course special, which was available 5pm-7pm. Everything was delicious!
November 2, 2013|Very Accommodating|5|Had an 8:30 restaurant. My son was running late, they held our table and sat us as soon as he came (one hour late). Food and service was outstanding.
November 2, 2013|Although crowded and very|5|Although crowded and very energetic our service and meal at Pane e Vino Saturday night was excellent. Amanda our waiter took her time with us and was very attentive. The maiale (braised pork shank with beans and escarole) tasted as if I had been made it at home. In fact I later learned that it was an old family recipe. The fusilli with ragu and sausage and meatball was also excellent. The wine list is extensive with quite a few reasonably priced, but delicious selections and the Tiramisu dessert was large and very tasty and rounded out an excellent meal. We will return.
November 2, 2013|Date Night|4|Had a memorable meal at Pane e Vino. Justin, our waiter, was knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. Service was friendly and fabulous even when busy and our water goblets were never empty. I had the osso bucco special and it was fall off the bone tender and tasty; the house pinot noir was a perfect accompaniment. Would recommend this restaurant highly; just make sure you make a reservation for the weekends. Also, ran into friends while at Federal Hill and Pane e Vino accommodated our party even though they were fully booked. Hostess came by several times during our meal and at the end which was a nice old fashioned Italian touch. Will definitely return again.
November 1, 2013|Parents weekend at Providence C.|4|Went to this restaurant during Providence College parent weekend. We had a party of 7 including 2 vegetarians. The waiter was excellent and very accommodating. all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals! My only issue was that we were celebrating our 25th anniversary with our children and when i had made our reservation on your website, I made a note that it was a special dinner for us. Unfortunately there was no mention of it by the waiter or hostess. The only reason I made a note of it was because someone on yelp had mentioned that when they made their reservation, they stated that they were celebrating an anniversary and they had set the table with a card and confetti etc....but in spite of that, we had a wonderful time and would go back!!
November 1, 2013|Enjoyed our dinner|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Pane e Vino. I had been there years ago and it was as good as I remembered it. We had a special occasion (Freshman Parents weekend) and it was a great way to start a wonderful weekend with our son. Our waitress was right on track with recommendations and specials and the food came out promptly which was wonderful. The only downside to the meal was that the excellent ceasar salad that came with our fixed price meals was extremely small, the sausage/meaball entree was also very small and ironically had very little pasta, and the wine prices were very high as compared to Cheesecake factory. Overall, however, we were satisfied with our meals.
October 26, 2013|Had heard a lot about Pane|3|Had heard a lot about Pane e Vino and so was excited to try it. Ended up being mildly disappointed. The appetizer, fresh figs served over prosciutto and drizzled with balsamic vinegar was very good. For the entree, I tried the bucatini alla matriciana. While the bucatini was cooked al dente and the sauce was quite tasty, there was WAY too much sauce in the bowl. It was a rather chunky sauce and I ended up pushing half of it off to the side. It really overwhelmed the pasta. A decent Italian restaurant should not make such a mistake. Also, the dessert, a molten chocolate cake, was rather uninspiring. So overall I was disappointed in the meal, given the high ratings that others have given Pane e Vino.
October 26, 2013|Good, but far from outstanding|3|Service, while professional, was rushed - clearly they wanted to rapidly turn over the tables. Check arrived with dessert and coffee (same thing happened at the next table). Food was of good quality, but was oversalted. Portions were ample.
October 26, 2013|Everything was good, but the|4|Everything was good, but the steak portion was a little on the small side for the price.
October 25, 2013|Awesome|5|Everything was awesome. My husband and I went for our date night! I had chicken Parm., with Clams App., which was outstanding, I have to say it was the best chicken Parm., I ever had! My husband had Smoked Mozzarella, small shrimp Pasta dish, Swordfish special he said was savory. Service was wonderful our waiter new everything in a good way!
October 18, 2013|Great Night|4|We has a great time for Dinner there. Great service, great drinks and great food. They did not push us out at the end of the meal, which was great too. This is not a low-end ret., but it was definitely a good value for a place with some nice atmosphere.
October 18, 2013|Great food but...|3|The food was amazing, the service did not meet the same stsndards. It was a busy Friday night at dinner time but our server frequently forgot drinks and was hurrying is to get out of the table as soon as our check arrived.
October 13, 2013|Great Italian cuisine!|4|Food is excellent! Favorite dish is Risotto Frutti di Mare! Waiters and waitresses are super friendly! Great service! Ambiance is very charming and inviting! Restaurant offers complimentary valet parking as well! My favorite restaurant in Rhodes Island! Place is a gem!
October 11, 2013|First timer here|5|Came across restaurant through Internet, their menu was posted online-looked great-and it was! Great specials too! Recommend for smaller groups or cozy dinner. We'll be back for sure!
October 11, 2013|Never Ever Ever Again!!!!|1|We were seated at the worst table with reservations. The table shaked and shifted. Had to put my shoe under the table to keep it from shaking ...when I forgot and moved my foot the table sloped back down! We had a partial wall on one side and a couple 10 inches so that the waiter never walked in between us just stood off to one side. They never refilled our water glasses or asked us if we needed anything once the meal was served. Ordered a drink from there drink selections and it was terrible .... I mentioned this to the waitress. Never asked me if I wanted something else to drink nor did they take it off the bill. We have eaten in many restaurants on Federal Hill. I will never go back nor would I recommend it. rants on the Hill.
October 11, 2013|Excellent restaurant and great staf|5|"My adult children and I had dinner at Pane e Vino to celebrate my daughters first ""real"" job. The atmosphere was perfect. The waitstaff were very friendly and on top of their game. The food was great and the bread pudding(which I usually never eat) was to die for."
October 6, 2013|Great Restaurant on the Hill|4|Always a great dinner at Pane e Vino. We requested a quiet table, and were rewarded with exactly that! We brought guests from Montreal, and they loved the place and the dinner.
October 6, 2013|Great food|4|The food was great. We ordered the veal Milanese and lobster raviolis in a cream sherry sauce. The veal was tender but a little dry b. It did.come with arugula and some dressing but light. The portion size with with raviolis was a little skimpy though.. The only downfall with our visit was that I ordered a cappuccino with a splash of frangelico and a regular coffee came out. Then sent it back and all they did was.put the froth cream on the regular coffee and sent it back to me. Then the canolli we ordered came out after we finished our coffees.
October 5, 2013|Exceptional quality dining|5|Five stars all around. Celebrated a special birthday and it was a great choice. Five entree specials - all sounded delicious. Bruschetta appetizer was huge- 4 of us couldn't finish it! Rigatoni al forno was superb- smoky, cheesy, wonderful! So many menu choices to go back for!
October 5, 2013|phenomenal|5|Service was great, excellent wine list and the food was outstanding
October 4, 2013|Memorable meal!|4|Our party of 4 had a great experience at Pane e Vino. We appreciated the table by the window, too. We loved our waiters and everyone raved about their food. The only thing holding me back from giving this restaurant 5 stars was the tasteless polenta cake that accompanied my delicious scallops. Please dream up something else to go with the scallops! Overall, though, we had a great time at Pane e Vino. Oh and the caprese salad using heirloom tomatoes was fab! The prix fix menu was a great deal, too! We look forward to going back. :)
October 2, 2013|First time at Pane E Vino|4|First time at Pane E Vino for myself and 3 friends . The service and food was great and we had a really nice time. Thank you.
September 28, 2013|Wonderful from appetiser to desert!|5|Our absolute favorite restaurant to dine at when we are in Providence. Third time the other evening, and just as wonderful as the other two. Consistently great food and service. The freshest of fish and meats and lovely presentation of plates. Nice deserts finish off the perfect meal! Can't wait to go back!!
Dined on September 27, 2013|Never disappoints...|5|They changed the menu this year, making some absolutely lovely additions. The quality and service remain excellent, and we always feel like we‚Äôre coming home when we dine there.
September 27, 2013|Pane e Vino - Wonderful Evening !!!|4|Excellent attentive & professional service, combined with beautifully prepared food - a winning combination at Pane e Vino. We'll be back, because it was one of the best dining experiences we've had in Providence.
September 27, 2013|Always Great|4|As usual, Pane e Vino offered a terrific fixes price menu on week days from 5 to 7pm & this weeks was excellent and fairly priced.. Every thing was delicious, the smoked mozzarella in a marinara sauce, the chicken marsala, & golden raisin bread pudding all were lovely.
September 23, 2013|Our favorite Providence restaurant|5|Another terrific experience at Pane e Vino. Wonderful food, great setting, outstanding service and a first-rate wine list. The 50% discount on wine on Sundays and Mondays is a great benefit ... we enjoyed a Barolo this time. We would go back to Pane e Vino again and again.
September 22, 2013|Pane e Vino|5|This is my second time I've been to Pane e Vino, the first time a table for two, the second time a table for nine. The food was amazing both times and everyone, which is hard to do with a larger crowd, enjoyed what they ordered. The red sauce is special and the Italian tradition runs deep in every dish. A truly wonderful experience and a gem among restaurants on the famed Federal HIll of Providence. Grazie!
September 21, 2013|Great food and amazing GF options!|5|We found out about this restaurant through various gluten free websites and were encouraged to find almost the entire menu could be made gluten free. This is definitely a rarity for Italian restaurants, so we were excited to try it. Pane e Vino did not disappoint. We got appetizers, a salad and entrees that were all amazing - my wife was raving about the mushroom ravioli and said the GF rolls were the best she's ever had! A wonderful place to go if you're in Providence; we give it our highest recommendation.
September 19, 2013|Traditional but creative|4|Broad selection of starters, salads, pastas and entrees -- mostly Italian inspired, but with a twist. You will have far more options than the usual pasta with sauce on the side of your protein. The mista salad is just right -- the ingredients and dressing are a perfect match. The duck confit is divine, as is the mushroom ravioli that accompanied the duck the evening we dined there. My husband's salmon was accompanied by an outstanding side of black lentils -- perfectly cooked al dente, not at all mushy. Other dishes featured barley, polenta cakes, etc. It's nice to dine at an Italian restaurant that has so many options for starches or grains -- though my pasta was delicious. Bravo, Pane e Vino!
September 14, 2013|Fabulous|5|Our party of four ordered a variety of entrees and every one was excellent. Service was superb: attentive and friendly but not intrusive. I can't wait to go back!
September 14, 2013|I went to Pane y Vino to celebrate|5|I went to Pane y Vino to celebrate my mom's birthday, and was so pleased with the food and the service. I can't eat gluten, and they have a complete and comprehensive gluten free menu, including bread and desserts. Everything was delicious, and the servers were incredibly accommodating. It's a wonderful place for a special occasion.
September 13, 2013|Delicious and authentic|5|An outstanding meal! The wine, prosciutto, cheese, pasta, and fish were all superb. I felt like I was in Italy again (esp since the diners next to me were speaking in Italian!)
September 9, 2013|Wonderful Meal and Ambience!|5|This was the first time my wife and I dined at Pane e Vino. We loved the service and ambience of this Federal Hill restaurant. The food was very good , starting with the fig appetizer and a wonderful spinach salad. Our main course consisted of the veal shank special and a traditional parmagiana eggplant with a fine tomato sauce (gravy). You will not be disappointed choosing this restaurant for any occassion!
September 8, 2013|Loved it!!!!|5|We had a group of 7 coming from different places and meeting in Providence. We selected this based on reviews and we were not disappointed. Several of us had different items from the prix-fix menu and it was a bargain plus all delicious. All plates were clean when sent back to the kitchen. We had an app of stuffed zucchini blossoms that was amazing. Some good wine from Montepulciano that was a good price and taste!
September 8, 2013|Never disappoints...|5|This is our go-to on Federal Hill, consistently excellent food and service!
September 6, 2013|Great night out|5|Went to Pane e Vino for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful, special occasion. Food was outstanding, wine selection great. Unusual spin on typical dishes. Serving sizes great. A bit pricey but worth it for a special celebration. Dessert not too exciting.
September 3, 2013|Anniversary Surprise|5|"First time diners here-Valet parking, relaxing music, delicious fresh gravy (sauce) a & notable wine list. Our waiter talked us into having the ""bread pudding."" It was not my mother's bread pudding! It was exquisite!! What a great meal & evening."
September 2, 2013|A providence gem!|4|The fantastic food, the friendly staff and the Monday wine special made it a wonderful evening.
August 31, 2013|We have been there many times|5|We have been there many times and enjoy it always. Staff efficient and friendly
August 30, 2013|The food was outstanding,|5|The food was outstanding, the Filet was cooked to perfection, along with the asparagus and potatoes. The cappuccino was also good. The cheese cake was just ok.
August 27, 2013|Wonderful experience|4|Choice this restaurant based on price and I have to say it was an excellent choice! The food was amazing I had chicken Marsala served w green beans and potatoe cake my daughter had chicken piccata the chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork. Would roughly recommend!
August 26, 2013|JUST PERFECT|5|"Great restaurant, fantastic food!! My rigatoni was tremendous, as well as all of the other 5 dishes that were served. All were piping hot and delicious. The only complain, albeit small, is that I find it extremely uncomfortable to sit in a restaurant that decides to leave the windows open facing the street. The warm humid air doesn't make for a comfortable atmosphere. I know it's a ""thing"" with many of the restaurants on the Hill but I can't stand eating hot food in warm humid air. Anyway, the staff accommodated us and pleasantly moved us to the rear of the restaurant where the AC was blasting. I will return very soon."
August 25, 2013|Excellent Choice on Federal Hill!|4|Had a great dining experience at Pane e Vino on Sunday night- a birthday celebration! Service was good, the dishes were well prepared and presented and the ambiance was very pleasing. Would recommend this neighborhood gem to anyone dining on Federal Hill in Providence!
August 23, 2013|GREAT EXPERIENCE!|5|"I definitely wanted to write a review for Pane E Vino because we had such a great experience when we went to dine there! It was my boyfriend's birthday and I wanted to make the night fun and nice for him. Well...I simply notified the restaurant about it being his birthday on my OpenTable reservation and when we got there for our reservation, Pane E Vino had set the table up with ""Happy Birthday"" confetti and a card from the restaurant! I thought that was sooo cute and my boyfriend thought it was GREAT!! :) Our server was fantastic and the food was great! To finish the meal we got the bread pudding...it's one of the best I've ever had...and I've had a lot! The night was a complete success!"
August 23, 2013|If you want red sauce Italian|3|you'll be happy here. I would have preferred a more sophisticated hand in the kitchen....
August 23, 2013|Excellent food|4|Great food Bruschetta with escarole & beans could be a meal.
August 20, 2013|Superb|5|When I wake up the next day still thinking about how delectable the food was.....that was Pane e vino!
August 17, 2013|Pane e Vino|4|I booked this thru the recomendations on open table. This is the 1st time I have been to the resturant. Went with my wife and old friends. The food was very good. The special Caprese salad was one of the best I have had. The service was outstanding. I would go there again
August 14, 2013|Another Neighborhood Gem|5|I am not one to write a lot so, Great Food, Great Ambiance and Great Service...
August 14, 2013|Love Pane E VIno|5|One of our favorites! Great food and the service is always great!
August 12, 2013|A Gem in Providence|5|We took a short trip to Providence and stopped here after reading lots of glowing reviews. Pane e Vino surpassed all of our expectations!! The food was amazing and our waitress was fantastic! It was my friend's birthday and she happens to be gluten-free. She was so happy to find that they had an extensive gluten-free menu and she could eat like a normal person! If you are in town, GO THERE! You will not be disappointed! Can't wait to go back!!
August 11, 2013|Our favorite restaurant on|4|Our favorite restaurant on the hill. The veal chop was overlooked this time
August 10, 2013|Pane E Vino - simply the best|5|"Pane E Vino has exceeded this foodie's every expectation for more than a decade. From the red sauce to braised veal (Osso Buco) to all the stunning seafood (from local scallps to literally anything made al ""Aqua Pazza"") and everything in between - Pane E Vino plates up the best of the best - EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I am fortunate to have developed an appreciation for great food and dining over 20 yrs of International travel but perhaps more importantly in 40 yrs of cooking and sharing family meals as the 3rd generation Sicilian son and sous-chef to the world's greatest Italian cook: my mother. How good is Pane E Vino? I brought my my mother here for her 65th birthday - and she raved. Pane is my first recommendation in Providence, always."
August 9, 2013|Gluten Free Menu|5|Great restaurant, Their gluten free menu was the best, and so much to choose from. I was so excired to havegluten free rolls. They also had a great blueberry gluten free vodka. I was happy!
August 8, 2013|Great food and wine!|5|We had looked at the menu and wine list on line, and had pretty much decided what we would be ordering. To pair with the steak, I chose, we picked an Amarone wine. I had a concern that the bottle should be opened well ahead of time, so I talked to them on the phone, they gave me assurances that if decanted the wine would be very drinkable for our dinner. That is what we chose to do and the wine was luscious! They also offered to open it ahead of time if that was what we really wanted. Very accommodating.
August 6, 2013|Can't Say Enough!|5|Don't miss out on this gem. Every meal (5 in total), including a gluten free pasta dish, was EXCELLENT. I can't say enough. The service was excellent, very attentive and friendly. We had it all from appetizers to dessert. The gluten free bruschetta was to die for and everyone raved over their dishes which came from the kitchen nice and hot. The chocolate lava cake was heaven and the caramel gelato was the best I've ever had (and I studied for 6 months in Italy). This was our first time at Pane e Vino and it is now our favorite restaurant in Providence. Don't miss it!
August 2, 2013|Yum!|4|I have Celiac disease and LOVE your gluten free options. Thanks for allowing me to have a choice when I go out to eat! The only thing I would say Pane e Vino needs help with is the bar. It's hidden to the side and not as well used as it could be!
August 2, 2013|well prepared seafood|4|Had nicely prepared striped bass and clam appetizer. reasonably priced. Very good service. Nice wine list.
August 2, 2013|Excellent apps. One veal dish|4|Excellent apps. One veal dish excellent, another dried out. Lasagna so-so. Server was great. We were seated in the back where it was VERY loud because the space is so narrow. If you want to hear yourself, sit up front.
July 31, 2013|Had never been here or heard|5|Had never been here or heard anything about it, with the exception of online reviews. So glad we decided to try it and save us the commute to Boston. Food was delicious and our server, Vanessa, was awesome! We will definitely be visiting again!
July 31, 2013|Excellent food and service|5|The food was excellent. All five in our party had different appetizers, entrees and desserts and we all enjoyed our meals. The waitress was very friendly, attentive and helpful. The hostess overheard me say happy birthday to my daughter even though we hadn't said anything about it when making the reservation and she had the happy birthday confetti on the table and the staff sang happy birthday when they brought out dessert. We had a very nice dining experience..
July 25, 2013|The service and food were|4|The service and food were great. A very enjoyable experience.
Dined on July 20, 2013|Excellent Dining!|5|This restaurant is my favorite restaurant in Rhode Island. Ambience is warm and charming. It embodies all the old world charms of Italy. Staff is friendly and food is amazing! My favorite dish is Risotto ai Frutti di Mare... to die for! And for dessert ...Golden raisin bread pudding ...delicious!!!
July 20, 2013|Happy with the choice|4|We were happy with our choice during restaurant week - what it's all about; being able to sample the foods at an affordable price. Although I probably only saved about $5 off the regular prices and the portions weren't the same as you would get from the regular menu. Although we had reservations we still had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes before we were seated but worth the wait. One critique would be that they go overboard on the tomatoes on pasta dishes. I like tomatoes and San Marzano to boot, but the star of the dish got lost under a sea of San Marzano. I had the ravioli; could hardly taste the filling. Appetizer, I had the beet salad ‚Äî delicious! Ddessert, bread pudding - one of the best I've ever tasted. Overall recommend.
July 20, 2013|Great Time|4|Lot's of people in the restaurant, quite energetic probably due to restaurant week. Good food, prepared well. Service was relaxed so you had time to enjoy the night out.
July 19, 2013|Very Special Dinner|5|I hosted my girlfriends for a week in New England. Our dinner at Pane e Vino was our last night before early morning airplane departures. It was a HIT! First, the service was welcoming, friendly and professional. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful with our wine selection, even writing up a take away card with the info. Second, the food was fabulous. Everyone was happy. I also used the valet service and the valet was terrific. All in all, I was pleased to have selected such a great restaurant.
July 19, 2013|one of the best in Providence!!|5|One of my favorite places. the food is top notch the service was very good. my only complaint was the valet. He pulled the car up. left my door open took my tip, and didn't even open the door for my fiance or 84 year old grand mother, very unprofessional, but please don't let this deter you from this great restaurant.
July 17, 2013|Exceptional Service!|5|My husband and I went to Pane e Vino this week to celebrate our anniversary. The food was excellent, however it was the service that truly stood out. It was immediately noticable just how well the entire staff works together. They make it a priority that every table's needs are met. We ordered off the Pre-Fix menu, and everything was delicious... from the calamari and baked mozzerella to the gnocchi and swordfish. We will be back soon!
July 15, 2013|Great place|4|One of our favorite spots in Providence. Food is consistently excellent and service professional.
July 13, 2013|Special|5|I truly enjoyed my visit to Pane Vino. The meal met my expectations and more. I will return soon!
July 13, 2013|Best Italian Restaurant on the Hill|5|While most of the restaurants on Federal Hill are very good, Pane e Vino is tops on our list. Friendly, attentive staff, outstanding food, great wines. It's a 40 minute trip for us, but well worth the drive!
July 13, 2013|Oh, Did you want anything else?|3|"Seated on time. Service was good for drinks and our order was taken quickly. Then we fell into the black hole. Never got the water glass filled. Never came back to see how we were doing after the food was served. It took forever to get the attention of the wait staff to let her know we actually wanted desert and her comment to us was ""oh, did you want something else?' Then we went through the same process to get the check with the same comment ""oh, did you want something else?"" It actually took an hour to place the desert order, get it, and then get the check. The food was good and there is a large choice of gluten free items on the menue, which is what brought us here. Summary: the first hour was ok, the second hour was tiresome for us."
July 12, 2013|not the best|1|The service wasn't good. We waited a while for our drinks and for our appetizers I wasn't in the mood for the meal because I didn't have high expectations since they started off with bad service.
July 10, 2013|fantastic taste|5|The restaurant week dinner menu is fantastic. I usually order their Calamari Fritti as appetizer. The entree menu seems to change over time, I ordered seared sea scallops served over roasted summer vegetable cous cous with citrus aioli; taste was impressive, only three seared sea scallops - a little bit less than I thought. I have ever tried both Housemade Tiramisu and Golden Raisin Bread Pudding on the menu, both are good.
July 10, 2013|More than 5 stars...|5|"Having sampled some of the food during the Federal Hill Stroll, we decided that Pane e Vino was on the ""DEFINITELY GOING BACK"" list! We were NOT disappointed! We had a reservation and were seated IMMEDIATELY upon arrival. The menu for ""Restaurant Week"" looked superb and made decisions difficult. We started with the Arancini ai funghi and Insalata di Barbabietole (of course we sampled each others). The gnocchi was made with all fresh and locally sourced ingredients - and did not disappoint. The pork shank was so well prepared, a knife was not needed! Dessert was Golden Raisin Bread Pudding - a perfect ending. Beverages were Sicilian Iced Tea and Sangria... Service was excellent...beyond 5 stars!"
July 9, 2013|we dined here as part of restaurant|5|we dined here as part of restaurant week & i was not let down. went with a friend & we opted to split everything down the middle. so glad we did too! EVERYTHING was delicious. i'm quite picky when it comes to a good tomato sauce. this one was delightful. our server was spectacular. i wish i took down her name - she was knowledgable about the wine recommendation & all around a pleasant person to encounter. there are so many italian restaurants to try on fed hill, this one stands out for food, atmosphere,& service.
July 8, 2013|Authentic Italian|4|We went here for the first night of restaurant week, food was outstanding. We split the beet salad and arancini apps. The arancini was great, the beet/goat cheese salad had a nice balance. I had the baked gnocchi with san marzano tomatoes and smoked cheese and it was great. My girlfriend had the scallops which were also very tasty, however it would not have been enough food for me had I ordered it. She had the tiramisu and I had the bread pudding, both were fresh and delicious. The service (outside of getting the wrong app at first) was also good. Our waitress seemed knowledgeable about the menu and w/o us asking she added a second table next to ours for more space, as it was very small. That was very considerate and appreciated.
July 6, 2013|We've been to this restaurant|3|We've been to this restaurant many times. The food just wasn't as good this time as usual.
July 1, 2013|I love Pane e Vino|5|We just took my nephew, a foodie, to Pane e Vino for his 18th birthday. What a fabulous experience! We all had incredibly delicious food, from salads through main course and on to dessert. We will definitely go back! I highly recommend this restaurant!
June 29, 2013|What a great find!|5|Outstanding food and friendly, knowledgeable and attentive service - the halibut special, baked mozzarella and veal marsala dishes were as good as I have had anywhere. Great find - we will be back!
June 29, 2013|Spending some time in Italy|4|The food was really good, what you can expect for this price level. Especially the bread pudding dessert was awesome! The wine list is notable, but order a bottle instead of by the glass. Our waitress did an excellent job. The paste was just fine: not too fast and not too slow. You feel like being back in Italy, which is a meant as a nice compliment.
June 28, 2013|Pane e Vino gets better and|5|Pane e Vino gets better and better. The food is excellent. We have come for large family celebrations and small intimate groups. No one is ever unhappy. There is no need to go into Boston for Italian cuisine this matches or surpasses them all. The tomato and Burrata mozzarella appetizer is memorable. The restaurant is accessible if you go through the back entrance. Notify the staff you are here and they will welcome you into the back. The staff are helpful and understanding for folks like me mobility impaired and arriving on a scooter.
June 22, 2013|Reliable great place|5|We had a wonderful dinner with our friend at my husband's favorite place on Federal Hill. All of us were impressed with the consistent quality from appetizer to dessert. We would recommend Pane Vino as a great place for any dinner from a week day to a week end.
June 21, 2013|Delish! Haven't had a bad|5|Delish! Haven't had a bad meal yet! Pane E Vino is our favorite restaurant on Federal Hill
June 19, 2013|best calamari & veal parm|5|enjoyed our first visit to Pane Vino, will definitely be back!
June 16, 2013|great!|5|Everything at this restaurant was good from the food all the way to the service. Will definately go back again.
June 15, 2013|Relaxing evening|5|Our table was ready on time-always a bonus. All six of us enjoyed our dinner, my lobster ravioli was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. We were pleasantly surprised when the bill arrived-very affordable!
June 15, 2013|Anniversary Dinner|5|The service was excellent, all the staff very friendly. Food was excellent, perfect portions. Nice wine list. Definately recommend to a friend and would return
June 15, 2013|New in the city|4|The food is good, and vegies even better. We ordered sea food disches and they were really spectacular. The wine is also something remarkable. We have had the opportunity of being around the world, and in Europe specially, and this food is comparable to the best restaurants in Paris and Germany. One recommendation: we ordered Porto wine with our desert, ideally we would've loved to have fruit (berrys any kind), and sorted cheese, but we have it with a chocolate cake because you don't have that in your menu (maybe too European, and people don't eat it in this area). Maybe something to consider adding in your menu in the future.
June 14, 2013|Excellent ! Excellent ! Excellent|5|Excellent ! Excellent ! Excellent ! Can't wait to eat here Again !!
June 14, 2013|Slightly overrated|3|The veal chop parm was good but not excellent. I've had better both at Federal Hill and in Boston. The swiss chard ravioli was very good.
June 14, 2013|GREAT food, wonderful experience!|5|I have been to Pane E Vino on a couple of different occasions. Each time the food has been superb! On this visit I was with a group of friends for a ladies night dinner. Our drinks, food and service were all amazing. Our waitress impressed us with her knowledge, demeanor and attentiveness and other wait staff we encountered were also very helpful and friendly. We had a show to attend after dinner and had a limited amount of time. Not only did they accommodate us in a timely, but not rushed, manner, but they also let us know when it was near the time to leave and even called a cab for us. I can't wait to go back. Thinking of it is already making my mouth water!
June 8, 2013|Nice & cozy|5|"Went here with a small group this weekend. The place is small, but the lay out is decent and you don't feel too cramped. The bartender made delicious drinks, and our Waitress Allison was knowledgable and friendly. Our meals were a pleasant surprise...each one, from appis to seafood to meat to pasta...everyone commented on the portions and taste. We were all impressed. It's a hidden gem, as it's not in the middle of the ""busiest"" part of the hill. You won't be disappointed!"
June 8, 2013|Outstanding as always. Never|5|Outstanding as always. Never a disappointing meal here and service is excellent. Recommend highly.
June 7, 2013|Girls nite out|5|We arrived a little early for our reservation and were seated right away. We were seated a window table as I had requested. Waiter came to the table promptly and asked if we wanted water or any other drinks. The wait staff was very attentive and returned several times to see if we needed anything. Everyone one in the party had some kind of a seafood dish. Three women had the seafood special and liked that it could be prepared a few different ways. Portion sizes were not huge but by all means enough. Everyone enjoyed their meal. No complaints. Even though there were people waiting to be seated when we finished we were not rushed to pay the bill and leave. All in all a very pleasant dining experience.
June 6, 2013|Consistently good|4|We are never disappointed at Pane e Vino. Menu selections are extensive though not overwhelming. Very good selection of wines to compliment food choices. Knowledgeable waitstaff. Comfortable seating. Valet parking.
June 3, 2013|Amazing food, service, ambiance|5|Everything about this restaurant was wonderful. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional.
June 1, 2013|Best GF Menu/Excellent Cuisine|5|I met my two college roommates here for a Saturday night dinner. Pane e Vino is cozy, yet vibrant with a broad menu of Italian cuisine. I have celiac disease and require a gluten free meal, which is why we chose Pane e Vino -- they have the most extensive GF menu I have seen in 10 years! The food was excellent, as was the service. To start, we shared the GF calamari and GF ceasar salad (complete with 'rustic' gf croutons!). I enjoyed the GF Chicken Piccata while my friends both ordered a chicken, ziti dish with tomato cream sauce. We all agreed it was wonderful and we will be back!
May 31, 2013|Great food|5|The food was delicious. The service was wonderfulf. My wife and I are slow eaters and we tend to take out time and make a evening outmof it. There were several coupled that had came and went while we ate. Out waiter was perfect at the pace he brought out our dished and the meals of the other customers. He never interrupted us but was always there when we needed him. It is very rare to find a restaurant that can serve a meal so perfectly
May 25, 2013|Graduation weekend|4|Went here for Brown graduation celebration. Absolutely fabulous food, Mike was a very friendly and attentive waiter. Although the restaurant was crowded, orders for 6 people came out at a great pace. We love this restaurant-one of the best on the hill.
May 25, 2013|Busy Saturday Night|4|Overall experience for a party of 4 was very good. Very busy Sat night with 8pm reservations. Arrived early and were seated about 15 minutes late. However, we waited a full hour for our meal once seated. Apparently the kitchen was hit with a bunch of orders all at once. Our waiter was mostly attentive, but drinks were not always filled when asked. He offered us a free drink, which was nice...but food arriving past 9pm was unreasonable. When we got our meals my shrimp was overcooked, although the flavors were great in the risotto. My friend's scallops were wonderful, as were the rest of the dishes. Manager asked how everything was and when I mentioned the shrimp she took it off the bill. Would try again, but on a less crowded night.
May 24, 2013|Could not be better|4|Took my wife here for her birthday and I have to say it was the best meal we have had in a very long time. Service was stellar and the food was even better. You can tell that they take great pride in what they do and it was refreshing to see it done right. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to have the perfect night.
Dined on May 24, 2013|Our appetizers were fabulous|3|Our appetizers were fabulous so we werr very excited to try our main dish unfortunately the risotto was watery, milley, very undercooked. The veal was rubbery and very over cooked.
May 21, 2013|The nicest staff in town!|4|I dined at Pane e Vino as part of a large group. Our server Amanda was truly outstanding -- attentive, knowledgeable, pleasant. All of the staff we encountered were great people. The food was excellent -- I recommend the squid ink pasta with lobster. And the bread pudding is the best I have ever had.
May 19, 2013|Good but not so good for Vegetarian|4|Pane Vino has consistently good food and acceptable service BUT they really miss the boat when it comes to being vegetarian friendly. Dishes that seem vegetarian on the menu have meat products in them. It's so easy to cook without meat. I really wish they would be more accommodating to vegetarian diets. We would dine there with greater frequency if they would apply their culinary expertise to meatless dishes!
May 18, 2013|Absolutely fabulous!|5|This was such a perfect dining experience. It was a very busy night, and we were seated a little past our reservation time. The hostess, which was a young girl, ensured that we were comfortable while waiting for our table. She even offered to bring us drinks if we so chose. When we were seated, the hostess had put us in the front dining area overlooking the street. It was such a cozy spot with candle light and perfect for our group of 6. Then our waitress came. Wish I could remember her name because she was GREAT. Very attentive, knew the menu inside and out and made excellent suggestions. Our food was to die for. Homemade pastas, delicious filet minion, scrumptious fresh scallops. I would recommend this restaurant 100 times over..
May 17, 2013|Memorable|4|Great place to celebrate our son's graduation! Food and service outstanding.
May 17, 2013|Great Italian Food|4|Among the restaurants on Federal Hill this is one of the best. Tables were crowded together and it was noisy. Too many people jammed into the restaurant.
May 17, 2013|We were a party of six and|5|We were a party of six and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The service was great inclluding the hostess and waiter. The experience exceeded our expectations. We will definitely go back again.
May 16, 2013|Changes...|4|Have been coming here for many years and greatly enjoy their early dinner special..especially the eggplant..found that the meals have changed both in presentation and quantity of food..we were placed in the front room and very isolated from the rest of the restaurant which definitely reduced the ambience of the experience...the waiter(new to our party) was impatient, bouncing from one area to another and did not provide a quality experience..hope not to see him on my next visit..
May 15, 2013|Fantastic|5|Thank you for an amazing service Kim. Everything was just perfect, and thank you for having such a wide selection of delicious gluten-free product, especially that cheesecake.
May 13, 2013|Looking forward for my next visit|4|Food was great - staff was friendly and attentive... My only negative was that my reservation for 7:00 pm (I arrived a few minutes early) didn't find me a table until about 7:15 - But it was well worth the wait, and I was very happy to have tried this spot for a first time. :)
May 12, 2013|Excellent, as usual!|5|This is our Federal Hill go-to! Really enjoyed the Mother's Day ahi tuna special...light and refreshing!
May 11, 2013|Our party of 3 had 8:30pm|4|Our party of 3 had 8:30pm reservations and despite a lot of diners waiting for tables we were seated on time. Wait staff was excellent as was the selection of wines and entrees. All of our meals (chicken, 2 pastas dishes) were well prepared and portioned. Noise level was vibrant and yet not enough to preclude comfortable conversation.
May 11, 2013|tight and loud|2|The one thing I can't forget was how loud it was at the small bar area, then at dinner the tables were packed together and was way to loud for a nice restaurant. I may expect this at Mc Donalds but not a place labeled as a romantic restaurant. I understand this is a sheared fault with the dinners with no respect for others. The food was good but I was so annoyed by the consistant rudeness I just wanted to be done and leave.
May 11, 2013|Great food but a long wait!|4|We live in Boston and come here every time we are in Providence (usually when we come down to run a race). This time around, a couple things went wrong. First, we had a reservation for 7pm. We showed up, valet parked the car and walked in the door at 6:55pm. We waited 45 minutes to sit down (for a table of 2). We barely received an apology and were certainly perturbed when finally seated. I would at least suggest that you offer a glass of wine while waiting (not even for free but as a convenience). Then when we returned to the hotel, we noticed that there was white paint on the back rear corner panel of our car (thanks to the valet service). We called the restaurant on Sunday and are still waiting on a return call (Tuesday now).
May 11, 2013|We'll be back|4|Even at 6:30pm on a Saturday evening, the restaurant was very busy and stayed that way for our entire stay. That may have been because it was Mother's Day eve, however, we never felt rushed and our waiter was very informative and helpful. We had a wonderful meal but did not leave room to sample the wonderful selection of desserts. We will definitely visit again. Highly recommend.

April 28, 2013|Excellent food. All courses|5|Excellent food. All courses were amazing, which is rare for such consistency at most restaurants. I don't live in the area, but I will still recommend this place to anyone I know who says they will be in Providence, RI.
April 27, 2013|Consistently good|4|Food is very good and consistent, service is respectful but somewhat amateurish. That said, definitely a place I would return to, but not a place I crave.
April 27, 2013|We always love the personal|5|We always love the personal attention from Paulo, as well as his knowledge of the menu and what we like. He makes great suggestions and answers all of our questions without us feeling hurried. The food was fantastic! We love celebrating special occasions here.

But I went with three others and they were not overwhelmed by their entrees. We all enjoyed the calamari and our salads, but the people that had the meatballs, swordfish, and bolognese were not that impressed. My entree with the sausage (cardinale?) was excellent.

April 16, 2013|This was our first visit to|3|This was our first visit to Pan e Vino. We ordered from their fixed price menu. We would be giving them a much higher rating if the food had arrived at the table hot, because the quality of their sauce is excellent. One appetizer was luke warm and the pasta on both entrees was cool. We ate the appetizers the way them came, but they were not as good as they could have been at the right temperature. We sent the entrees back, and they were returned hot but the overall expereince was just average because of this. A regular coffee was refilled with decaf. When the error was pointed out, the waiter didn't offer to correct the mistake until we requested a correction. It's all in the details, and some of them needed work.

April 7, 2013|Pane Perfection!|5|Everything you could hope for on a nice night out for dinner. Starting with the service: I think our server's name was Natalie? She was lovely. She was training a new server, but it never compromised our experience, it may have even enhanced it. Both were spot on. Now the meal? That was incredible: My companion and I like to order slowly, and try a number of items. We started with shellfish, moved onto a pasta (which they split without us asking), and two entrees, scallop and veal. The entire meal was perfectly prepared. I live on Cape Cod, where restaurants like this are few and far between (unfortunately). I can hardly wait to schedule another visit, because I'm sure the experience I had a Pane e Vino is the norm.

March 31, 2013|No lamb at Easter :(|4|We love Pane e Vino and go there regularly. We made a reservation several days in advance for Easter Sunday at 6 pm. I was going to cook lamb but when I received the e-mail that said lamb was on the menu for $22 we decided to take our group of 5 there. It was very disappointing to find there was no lamb as well as many of the menu items.
March 28, 2013|Great...as usual!|4|Of all the visits to Pane e Vino, I don't think we have ever had a bad meal or experience and our last visit was no different. The food and service were outstanding as usual and at this point something we have come to expect from one of the area's nicer restaurants.

They always seem to deliver an outstanding meal with service and attentiveness that is second to none. Monday is an excellent day to give it a try when all their wines, bottle and glass, are half off with dinner. A deal that is almost too good to be true.
March 23, 2013|Awesome dinner|5|We had a great dinner on Saturday. My Salmon was overdone the first time out, it was taken back to the kitchen, my waitress asked if I wanted a salad to be able to pick on while my bf ate his dinner, I said ok, but the dinner was out so fast that by the time she went to get the salad, the meal was back, cooked perfectly and was delicious. I greatly appreciate all the gluten free items. It was fabulous to have such a wide selection of appetizers (the calamari is fabulous!), pasta dishes, and even cheesecake for dessert...which is also very good. Service was great.... we have been many times and each time our service is great, the staff is hard working and attentive without being over-bearing.

We sat down exactly at the time of our reservation which was at 6pm. We were greated with enhusiasm and warm welcome. The host, bartender and waitstaff were all so very friendly. It was a nice family atmosphere, families young with the old in the dining rooms, however, it still seemed so romantic & comfortable. The noise level was very low even though conversations were at every table. The food and drinks were fantastic and dessert was to die for.

The food was exceptional and the service was well above average. We were hosting some friends who were equally impressed in their first visit to the restaurant.
January 26, 2013|a little snobbish on my part|4|The only reason I do not rate this restaurant 5 stars across the board is I have been spoiled with many dining experiences at Guide Michelin 3 star restaurants, but I feel Pane e Vino is the best on Federal Hill and based upon quality, service, and price, perhaps the best in Providence and surrounding area. Everything I have tried on the Menu has been very very good and best of all, the waiters are patient and they do not rush you. The wine list is excellent and fairly priced.
January 25, 2013|Everything was going well|3|Everything was going well but then the server did not inform me that the entrees that could be made into gluten free would not even be the same food. I was very surprised to find that the Gnocchi alla Sorrentina* Potato Dumpling Pasta, Narragansett Creamery Fresh Mozzarella, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Sweet Basil, was just gluten free pasta, not potato. I would have chosen a different entree if I had known. Then the server didn't offer us any coffee with our dessert and they started clearing our dessert dishes before we were finished. They serve bread when you arrive and I asked if they had any gluten free bread and the server just said yes and how many pieces would we like, when we got our bill they charged us for the gluten free bread

January 11, 2013|Stll one of the best on the hill.|4|Pane is one of my favorite restaurants in RI, but with many choices we only get there once or twice a year. On this occasion we found the calamari was pretty tough. Entrees were very good and the kitchen accommodated my request for a substitution. Not every good restaurant will do that. Our server was not especially good. Recited the specials list but did not add anything. Seemed to disappear at times, but rushed us at the end, when they were looking to turn the table. At a high end restaurant, I look for high end service and it wasn't there on this night. Place was packed on a rainy Friday night in January which is testimony to their fine reputation. But to be honest, my last trip to Sienna (across the street)was a better evening
January 10, 2013|Was always my favorite restaurant|3|This restaurant is a favorite of ours. The food is usually very good and they offer an excellent gluten free menu. The bruschetta with white beans was excellent as well as the drinks. We were disappointed with our meals this time ... Very salty. The server did offer to take them back, but since we have always enjoyed our food, we ate our meals and chalked it up to an off night. Not cool was charging $1 for a gluten-free roll. We understand GF food costs more , but add it to the price of the meal. Doing this would be transparent to the customer. Other restaurants in RI offer GF rolls and do not charge addt'l $. Do they add an extra $ to the meal? Maybe, but I wouldn't know. Would definitely go back.

If you are a vegetarian, it is easy to find a something to order, but many of the pasta entrees have a fish or meat component. The tomato soup that was available on the day we went was superb. Portions are large and caesars have fresh anchovies, not usually available.

Never a better night for using the valet service! The service was impeccable and the food divine in every aspect - simply scrumptous so fails to convey the subtle complexities of the fare! Warning: remain balanced in your indulgences as you will want to sample everything from the wines and appetizers through the desserts and ports. We even ordered a takeout entree to take home to the babysitter and an extra dessert for our oldest!"

Out server Nicole was super attentive, without being pushy. When we arrived at 6:30 the restaurant was pretty empty but by the end of our meal, the place was full. My swordfish special was cook nicely and the seafood in my husband's risotto di mare wasnt overcooked either. It was a little soupier than i expected (more like a zuppa de pesce with rice than a full risotto dish) but still very tasty. My only complaint was that our veggies were a little too salty (my rabe and the braised escarole with the brsuschetta appetizer). Desserts were great and the whole evening was a nice treat.

They served wonderful fried smelts as one of the antipasto items, but the portion was 3 two inch long smelts! The restaurant could have been more generous with the smelts, calimari and the clams vongole with angelhair pasta. Pane e Vino has long been one of my favorite restaurants. But we have notices over the years that the prices are getting very high for what is served, both food and wine. I'd like to be able to go more often but it doesn't seem to be worth the money any more.

December 13, 2012|Pane e Vino has become a classic|5|Pane e Vino has become a classic in a city known for good Italian restaurants. Service is wonderful; the kitchen will happily split dishes so that two can share them; and the wine list, offering Italian wines exclusively, is extraordinary. The bucatini all'Amatriciana is authentic, cooked from scratch from the classic recipe and not faked with generic sauce from a bucket. Menu offerings include original offerings created by the kitchen. There are few, if any Italian-American offerings, as P&V emphasices authentic Italian cooking. Portions are generous, so if you are two people for dinner, have an appetizer and then pick two main dishes and share them---so that you'll get more exposure to what this restaurant can do.

December 9, 2012|A Perfect Evening!|5|cI took my fiance for his birthday; and we were both very impressed. When making my reservation through Open Table, I asked that the staff say 'Happy Birthday' to him and address him by name as a greeting when we arrived and when the waiter introduced himself. He's not one for the whole 'singing dessert' bit, so I thought a warm acknowledgement would be nice. Not only did they do that, but they had a quiet table in the back decorated with confetti waiting for us. The service was perfect...the waiter anticipated and attended to our every need without being around every minute. The food was outstanding; we liked it so much that we purchased a few gift cards for Christmas gifts. My only regret is that I didn't know about this place sooner!

November 25, 2012|Dining again at Pane e Vino|5|Dining again at Pane e Vino we enjoyed a lovely meal. we had the trattoria menu which includes 3 courses from appetizer to dessert. My husband had a very generous bruschetta with beans and I had a light crunchy salad. When his eggplant parm came ht couldn't believe how large the portion was only eating 1/3 so he took the rest home for another meal. I had a perfect portion of chicken marsala with vegetables and potato. Our dessert was a great version of bread pudding which was well presented and tasted really yummy. my husband enjoyed 2 glasses of his favorite wine to accompany his meal. We will definitely return to this delightful place for another consistent repast.

November 4, 2012|FABULOUS!|5|"Because of their ""$20 birthday certificate"" that I received (every year on my birthday), we introduced our friends to Pane e Vino. We all ordered from their wonderful three course prix fixe menu; and we all ordered Pollo o Vitello ai Funghi con Marsala as our entree. It was fabulous! The portions on the prix fine menu are enough to satisfy most appetites. Some of their specials of the evening, as described by our waiter, sounded amazing. On a busy Saturday night, they did not rush us out. It was a lovely evening and we certainly return to Pane e Vino. If you go to Pane e Vino, make sure to ask for the birthday certificate card. It is a great offer for a fabulous restaurant."

All of our entrees were prepared perfectly, the Veal Chop served with red pepper & mushroom ravioli was out of this world. Our server was on top of everything, our drinks were never empty and we did not feel rushed even though it seemed very busy in the restaurant. The bread pudding was recommended for dessert, it was so delicious I had to ask for the recipe - which they gave me with no hesitation! What a great overall experience, I can not wait to go back again.

The bread was good Tuscan bread, and fresh, and the wine was good. The service was good. The tables are spaced far enough apart so that other diners are not an annoyance. There is a feeling of hospitality at the restaurant. Our only disappointment was the next day we wanted to go there for lunch and they were not open for lunch on a Saturday.

We had overheard a the hostess tell another couple that they were not running late with their reservations, but on time. We were not seated at our table until 9:00pm. No one had come up to us at all for the 45 minutes that we were there and offered us any assistance or let us know what was going on. We were completely ignored. The food was great, but having a reservation and not getting seated for a half hour after that is unacceptable.

October 11, 2012|The occasion was a reunion|5|The occasion was a reunion of college friends. We were seated in a semi-circle table in a back corner, an ideal location for old stories and laughs. The waitress was attentive, helpful and never rushed us. The food was fresh and delicious. A wonderful time and perfect location on Federal Hill.

October 7, 2012|The most pervasive adjectives|4|The most pervasive adjectives for taste were freshness of the ingredients and care in making each dish. Service left us wanting for nothing at any time. Staff were friendly and professional. There is a very affordable range of dishes to select from. I don't think it is possible to get a bad meal here. Great dinning experience every time.

The bartenders were absolutely clueless.They never looked up to acknowledge or check to see if anyone needed service.Very poor first impression of the service. However,once seated,our waitress was EXCELLENT.Very different service from her than at the bar.Dinner was good.Appetizers and salad were excellent.Filet Mignon was very good,lacked in flavor,as did the accompanying vegetables.Definitely needed seasoning.I would give Pane e Vino another try,but would order something different as an entree. Pasta dishes looked incredible!

The portions are just the right size, salad, entree and dessert and coffee, and reminds one of how dining is experienced in Italy. The service is always great!

My dates entree was also excellent Only problem, A special of fried Zuccini Flowers, one of my favorites, instead of being lightly battered was so over battered, it was impossible to taste the Zuccini flowers. I will return, and hope for better Zuccini flowers, as the rest of the meal, including dessert was superb.

September 7, 2012|The food here was just amazing!|5|The food here was just amazing! The red sauce was un like any other I have had and know I am already craving it. The homemade pasta was divine and the special appetizer beyond. Wish that it was not located in the tourist heavy Fed Hill area. The lack of cabs in the city is also too bad. Ended up having to walk all the way back down town at a late hour. But Fabulous dinner.
September 5, 2012|These folks have a great thing|4|These folks have a great thing going. I had the halibut special with green beans & roasted potatoes - cooked beautifully & served hot. Waitress was terrific, not overly attentive - just right. Beautiful & friendly too !

September 2, 2012|Pasta dishes were excellent.|4|Pasta dishes were excellent. My husband's stuffed veal chop was almost raw. They were out of one of the menu items that I would have loved to try (scallops with risotto, crispy prosciutto, fava beans and mascarpone). I had a crab stuffed ravioli with tomato cream sauce that was a very good second choice. Recommended wine was very good, but didn't really match our entrees. Need better bread basket.

August 31, 2012|The food was great but when|3|The food was great but when ordering they probably should have cautioned us if dishes were spicy. Even though they were not that busy the wait staff kept forgetting thing we asked for, such as as spoon. Additionally, coffee and desserts did not come out together or even close to one another. Wait staff was very nice and kept apologizing for errors and delays but that became annoying. I had been there before and other experiences were better because of the service.
August 29, 2012|Great wine, great food!|4|Great restaurant with plenty of seating. We had a party of 10 and sat at a table in the front of the restaurant with open windows to the street. A bit noisey but great open air. Our waitress was excellent and could explain anything on the menu in detail. The wine was fabulous and food was even better. I would go there again and recommend it to a friend.
August 26, 2012|My friends i enjoyed our dinner|5|My friends i enjoyed our dinner from the moment we drove up (we were early for reservation), our car was parked and we were seated immediately. The wait staff could not have been nicer and so helpful. We had attended a play at the PPAC and plan to return, so you will be hearing from us again. THANK YOU!!!!
August 25, 2012|Pleasant Surprise|4|Stumbled upon this restaurant 2 years ago & have been going back ever since. The Rigatoni ala Cardinale is divine!!! That dish alone is worth the drive from Boston
August 25, 2012|Won't return to this restaurant.|3|Won't return to this restaurant. Great reviews but the food did not hold up to the reputation. Very close quarters. Very much like a small neighborhood restaurant in an Italian village minus the food quality.
August 25, 2012|Excellent food and good service.|4|Excellent food and good service. Not too noisy which we appreciated--so nice to be able to hear each other talk!
August 19, 2012|Our second visit. I had received|5|Our second visit. I had received a Birthday coupon, and although we would have gone back without the coupon, it was an added bonus. Server was attentive and most pleasant, as well as neat and well kempt. Water glasses stayed full and were initially given automatically without having to ask. Second added bonus was that they are currently celebrating their 10th anniversary and it was a BOGO deal. And yes, I was able to use my coupon on top of that offer! (Which was also good on the daily specials). Breads are excellent and something to look forward to. Overall great evening!
August 19, 2012|Dine elsewhere for a better deal|2|Arrived 13 minutes early, and was asked if I wanted to eat in the bar! Said no, and was seated about five minutes late. The waiter took some time to get there, as it was busy. He was pleasant, but not very attentive once my order was taken. He did not check in with me on my entree until I was almost done, and I was never offered a refill on my water. He disposed of the potatoes that I wanted to take home; when I brought this to his attention he offered to have a new order made, but it was a moot point at that time (they were overcooked anyway). The shrimp was quite small and did not seem to be as much meat as the empty shell (included on the plate) would indicate. The scallops were excellent, however. I had a much better meal up the street!
August 19, 2012|Great Food & Great people|5|We arrived earlier than our 4:30 reservation and was greeted by the hostess which immediately stated that we could be seated at this time. The wine & drink list was great. We were not rushed thru our meal and that is something we appreciate when we are out to enjoy the evening. Great food and great people make for a great restaurant. Would definitely return and suggest to others
August 18, 2012|Food was excellent, service|3|Food was excellent, service good but our food took a long time to arrive at the table and it wasn't super busy. But overall definitely a nice dinner and we would dine here again.

August 18, 2012|Most dishes are over-sauced.|3|Most dishes are over-sauced. Pasta is drowning in sauce, veal dishes are drowning in sauce. Some people like this and some don't. I'm in the latter category. It's good enough and reasonably priced, but you can do better in Federal Hill.

The booths are fine bt the table that share a common bench seat against a wall are very close to each other. This is a minor faw that hardly detracted from an excellent experience.
August 17, 2012|Authentic Italian Food|5|This is my second time at this restaurant and it was just as wonderful. Very attentive server, great menu choices, wonderful entrees, the dessert menu is quite decadent - great place to eat on Federal Hill in Providence! Having been to Italy, I can say that this food is authentically prepared.

July 22, 2012|Delicious Food, Wonderful Service|5|My husband and I and another couple had dinner at Pane e Vino on Sunday. We were surprised that we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated for our 6 p.m. reservation, but the reason for the wait quickly became apparent. For the restaurant's 10th anniversary, they were offering a 2-for-1 entree special. What a delightful surprise! From the bread to the appetizers to the entrees to the wine, everything was delicious. The specials of the day included squash blossoms, a delicacy rarely offered. My striper bass, the fish of the day, was beautifully prepared. Those who had the Caesar salad raved about it. To top it off, we had an excellent waitperson, who didn't hesitate to decant our wine when we asked her to do that.
July 22, 2012|Celebrating our 37th anniversary.|5|Celebrating our 37th anniversary. They decorated the table with little gold stars and had an anniversary card for us too. The fusilli napoletano and the pan seared scallops were excellent. 2 for 1 entrees was a great deal!

July 20, 2012|I do not consider myself a|2|I do not consider myself a gourmet but I'm aware of what makes a good meal and try to follow the most recent trends in the industry. Pane e Vino appears to be using local providers which is admirable and lends itself to sustainability in the food business. Service was very good with great attention given to all in our group. We had come to the restaurant hoping to order from the Food Week menu. Nothing caught our eye. The pasta dish that I ordered was too salty. The risotto that my wife ordered was undercooked. There is no way that the chef tasted either of these dishes before plating. I am not comfortable sending meals back and do not make a practice of it. We should have ordered the pasta and meatballs that my son ordered.
July 20, 2012|The food was slow coming out|3|The food was slow coming out of the kitchen. Our reservation was for 6:30 and we left the restaurant at 9:00. I enjoy a relaxing meal, but this was a bit too long. The food was fine but not exceptional. The deserts were wonderful. I'd go back for desert and a glass of wine at the bar.
July 17, 2012|Pane e Vino is great!|4|Pane e Vino is a favorite that we don't get to as often as we'd like - it's a bit of a drive. We were a group of 6 and everyone enjoyed their appetizer, dinner and dessert (and the cookies). The only down side, and this was a first for us at Pane e Vine, was that dinner was quite delayed - like 45 minutes after our appetizers. It was Restaurant Week and the restaurant was full, so we assumed that may have contributed to the delay. However, our server and also the manager came over and acknowledged the delay, and apologized. After dinner, we were offered coffe/cappuccino on the house and were served a plate of wonderful cookies, canoli and biscotti, also on the house, which was very nice and much appreciated. We'll definitely go back.
July 17, 2012|Surprisingly quiet!|4|Simple, classic decor. Nothing extraordinary in terms of flowers or decor but calm and blissfully quiet. (ambient noise, yes but none of the nerve-jarring, frenetic music or high din of noise that makes most Providence restaurants feel like bull pens.) We were able to converse easily all night. I have heard rave reviews from friends. Our salads were quite good; I felt the calamari was tasty but excessively oily/greasy (and virtually miniature rings). The duck was excellent. Bread, too was irresistible and served with a trio of butter, olive oil, and another (probably bean?) spread. The tiramisu was a treat and I especially liked the cannoli - a more interesting filling than I've encountered before. Attentive service.

July 15, 2012|We went there based on others|5|We went there based on others reviews,and I totally agreed that Pane e Vino is the best restuarant in Providence. I had house cured duck confit which is cooked perfectly;you can actually smell the lovely duckling before it is placed on your table. Both appetizer and dessert ( caesar salad and dark chocolate gelato) are simple yet perfectly prepared. The service is also top notch, friendly and professional. The waitress made excellent recommendation on our cocktail. Overall this is one of the best dinning experience I had in Providence.
July 14, 2012|An excellent meal, from first|5|An excellent meal, from first to last course. Duck confit was a simple dish expertly prepared. It's a small restaurant so the wait staff is cramped and you can overhear rhe noise from the staff stations. Also, tabes are close together so you will hear the converesations of the adjoinng tabe. If you can get past this and concentrate on the food, you will be very happy.
July 14, 2012|Pane e Vino not only has superb|3|Pane e Vino not only has superb food, but superb gluten free entrees and dishes which are a necessity for us when we dine out. We have been there before, and it has consistenly superb preparations. Our issue last time was the length of time to get seated (with reservations) and the kitchen was backed up and slow.
July 13, 2012|Fantastic food, superior service|5|If you're interested in trying something new during Providence Restaurant Weeks, look no further than Pane e Vino. From the moment we were seated until the valet attendant brought the car curbside, my dining companion and I were treated to an exceptional experience. The staff were attentive and courteous, each ensuring that nothing had been overlooked or unmentioned. The menu selections from the special prix fixe menu were varied enough to provide a strong representation of the full menu. The calamari were outstanding: tender and not overpowered by the accompanying peppers or dipping sauce. The duck confit (my entree) and the blue crab ravioli (my companion's choice) were delicious, generously sized portions. Dessert: magificent! Bravo!
July 11, 2012|The food is always outstanding|5|The food is always outstanding at Pane e Vino...now that my wife requires gluten-free, it's great that they have such an extensive offering of gluten-free options. All were delicious!

We got stuck in the back room with a big business group which made it loud and very busy, but they handled it pretty well. Food was very good. Calamari was fresh, and the addition of suateed peppers was great. Pasta was fabulous and homemade. Veal chop and risotto was good, I would have liked it more charred since it ws from a wood fire. Staff was amazingly friendly and helpful.

June 17, 2012|Perfect in Every Way|5|Our dining experience at Pane E Vino was perfect! Our meal was absolutely the best we have ever experienced (we have eaten at many fine restaurants, as well as some in Italy). The scallop dish was delicious. The flavors were amazing and presentation was beautiful. We sat in the front room on a beautiful evening with the windows there wide open. There was some noise from the street in that particular room, but everyone seated there loved the breeze and the feeling of eating outdoors, while actually being inside. We have been raving about our meal there to our friends. Truly the best ever!

Warm and romantic ambiance and top notch service. We mentioned that it was our anniversary and the staff decorated our table. The Gluten-Free menu was extensive and the staff handled it very well. The Asa Bucco was superb and the wood-fired steak was mouth-watering.
June 15, 2012|Pane e Vino on Federal Hill|5|Pane e Vino on Federal Hill is a quiet Italian restaurant with excellent food and service. The wine list is extensive, with at least a page of bottles under $40, making choosing a bottle of wine with dinner an affordable option. The food was very good, although rather pricey (the less expensive entrees were around $25). Reservations are a good idea, as the restaurant seems to encourage lingering over coffee and desert or a last glass of wine and therefore doesn't turn over tables very quickly. Pane e Vino is a good choice for a special occasion or an evening out without the kids.

My friend had the Gnocchi and said it was as good as her mom made when she was a child. I had the corkscrew pasta with Kobe meatballs and sausage. It was great, the sauce flavorful and the meat, well, it was Kobe, so was sooooo tender. Our husband's had a tenderloin and lobster ravioli special and said it was fantastic. This is a keeper on our 'places to dine' list!

It was an extremely busy day with all tables seated and the restaurant was timely in serving our entrees appetizers were excellent, today they lived up to expectations this restaurant was in the pricey range, but worth it for special occasions. The tables/seating are very close to each as other reviewers have noted, so its a bit too cozy.
May 25, 2012|Considering it was one of|4|Considering it was one of the busiest weekends of the year we were pleased. A slight wait for seating but understandable. Good service, good food. We were seated away from open areas so noise and tumult not an issue. Will go back.
May 20, 2012|We were traveling and this|5|We were traveling and this was our first time in Rhode Island. Pane e Vino was our first stop for dinner when we arrived and it couldn't have gone smoother. I made reservations online which they followed up on. Everyone was extremely friendly, the food was amazing and the service was perfect, which I don't often say. Highly recommended if you are in the Providence area.

May 20, 2012|We just visited for my stepdaughter|5|We just visited for my stepdaughter's graduation dinner on May 20th. The restaurant was accommodating from the start since our party size changed multiple times due to our family living out of state. The servers were excellent and knew the menu well. Made several recommendations based on various criteria. Wine list was excellent, appetizer was amazing. The entrees were outstanding - veal chop, far diablo. They even cooked chicken parm even though it wasn't on the menu. We brought our own cake in so I cannot attest to any desires. The staff even wrapped up the leftover cake in boxes. We have been trying different restaurants on Federal Hill the last 4 years our daughter was at PC and we definitely saved the best for last!!
May 19, 2012|Valet parking, greeting, wait|5|Valet parking, greeting, wait service and food was excellent! It was a memorable experience for our graduation celebration that left our party of 8 extremely satisfied. Did I mention that the menu items have some very unique ingredients that make it very difficult to decide what to order? Highly recommended for fine Italian dining!
May 19, 2012|Had my lunch with my family|4|Had my lunch with my family and best friend. Excellent Italian cuisine!!
May 16, 2012|We have been to this restaurant|2|We have been to this restaurant several times and the service has progressively gone down hill. As we walked in the valet was slouched in a chair texting, his attire was cutoff cargo shorts. As we approached the hostess station the as no one there to greet us. Someone finally seated us by the windows (as requested). We were the first diners in that section. Shortly after we were seated, two other tables were seated. Both tables had there orders taken and were served before us. We also had to ask for water and drink refills. We had dinner specials which were outstanding, however this is the third time we have had some form poor service so its not likely we would return to this restaurant. RI has to many other options to choose from
May 13, 2012|Good Italian meal in Providence.|3|Good but not great, We enjoyed ourselves (party of 4) but not blown away by the meal. Long wait to be seated and unfortunately there is no comfortable place to wait. The small bar was crowded so we had to stand outside under umbrella's in a light rain. Several people recommended this restaurant as the best Italian food in Providence. I think Sienna around the corner is a slightly better choice.
May 13, 2012|We went for Mothers Day and|5|We went for Mothers Day and had a long leisurely lunch seated at a large table at the front of the restaurant with open windows to the street. The food was superb and the service was excellent. The table location was fun in that we were able to view the busy street activity and enjoy a wonderful breeze, although, at times, the roar of passing motorcycle would intrude on conversation. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
May 13, 2012|I have been to this restaurant|3|I have been to this restaurant many times. I've always had excellent service and the good has always been very good. This particular time the service was terrible. The waiter could have cared less if we were there. The restaurant was not busy and we had to keep asking other members of the wait staff for service. I will go back because I have been there many times before. But I will avoid this waiter like the plague.

May 7, 2012|Wonderful - food and atmosphere|4|The food was excellent - well-prepared, balanced and rich flavors. The waiter, Thomas, was superb. He is an Italian native with an extensive knowledge of wines. Personable and smart, he really contributed to our choices and the friendliness of the experience. A wonderful evening.

Other than that: great food, warm atmosphere, excellent service, superb martini (the litmus test)! Reasonably priced, too.

April 21, 2012|Disappointing|3|The food was excellent, however we were very disappointed with our experience. We have a baby & a toddlerat home, so my husband & I do not get out much. We wanted to relax & enjoy our food, but we felt very rushed throughout our meal. I was asked at least three times if I was done with my meal and I was not. During dessert, the waiters were setting up the other tables in the room for a birthday party. As soon as I put my fork down, my dessert plate was taken away and the check brought over. We felt like we had to rush to finish our dessert and coffee. The food is pretty expensive and it would have been nice to enjoy our dinner a little longer.

April 15, 2012|Top notch Italian dining|5|Great food, great wine, super staff. Highly recommended.
April 13, 2012|Slightly dissappointed|4|As always the food and service was great until the end of our meal. We were just ordering dessert but we could tell that we were being rushed. It had gotten busy and there were a few people waiting. We had made reservations and it wasn't like we were just sitting there with a drink, we had ordered dessert and still had to eat that. It was very uncomfortable and we ended up rushing through dessert so we could free up the table. During that time the waiter and hostess came to our table 3 or 4 times to see if we were done and to take our check. It just wasn't a comfortable situation and we really enjoy going there because they usually do let you take your time.

April 12, 2012|A Sure Bet Every Time|4|"Pane e Vino is a regular haunt for me. The food is always fantastic and the service is usually quite good. What I love about this restaurant is that they are always willing to accomodate you if you have special needs. While I am a firm believer that a ""chef knows best"" about how to serve his or her food, there are times when I have just had a craving for something in particular that is not on the menu on that particular day. When I have asked for something ""different,"" then chef has been really great about giving me a fantastic meal. The wine here is a pretty good selection, lots of Italian wines that are not your typical fare."
Dined on April 8, 2012|Go Here!|4|The food was great from a superior and fresh antipasto plate a must have, to well prepared entrees and a with a very good wine selection. My only regret is that I have not been here before. Would highly recommend Pane e Vino and look forward to my next visit.
April 6, 2012|Great food, below-average service|4|Food was great - very fresh - and the marinara sauce was good and spicy on my mussels appetizer. Unfortunately we were shoved into a far back corner which made us feel a bit cut off. There was no excuse for that, as we came early and the place was virtually empty. Our friends were already seated or I would have asked for a different table. We had one chief waiter but a couple of others came and went, so it was a bit confusing. We didn't get plates for our shared dessert and had to wait a while until someone came back. Waiter did not tell us about the specials until we asked. But since the food was good we would definitely come back and try again!

March 24, 2012|Wonderful dinner experience|5|Our dinner was an anniversary celebration and I am very pleased we picked Pane e Vino. From start to finish it, the food, the wine and the staff truly met our expectations. This is more than just an average Italian restaurant that can fill your plate, it provides many unique entrees for you to choose from.
March 17, 2012|this was my first time there,|5|this was my first time there, and I was interested in trying it because they had a gluten free menu.

February 25, 2012|Very disappointing experience|1|Very disappointing. Noisy, cramped, mediocre service. Food was downright embarrassing: antipasto served without adequate bread/toast; veal chop burned at the edges and smothered in red sauce worthy of a fast-food restaurant; fish special arrived overcooked/dried out; pasta unimaginative and pasty.
February 20, 2012|Love the half price wine nights|4|Love the half price wine nights on Monday! Such an amazing deal...and the food is always delicious!
February 18, 2012|We have gone to Pane E Vino|5|We have gone to Pane E Vino numerous times and it never disappoints! On this occassion, we split the mussels as an appetizer and they were fabulous. The sauce was particularly good. My husband had a veal dish with mushrooms and some sort of mushroom sauce that he enjoyed quite a bit. I almost always get the same thing--the Buccantini all'amatricianna, which is always wonderful. We had a delightful wine. The waiter was generally good--however, we like someone a little less intrusive--it's a fine line to be overbearing and not attentive and hard to find, but he was fine overall. Once thing we liked quite a bit was that it wasn't a problem to make a little later reservation (@9:30) We will definately be back again!
February 18, 2012|Federal Hill Gem|5|Great, knowledgeable staff. I always appreciate when the waiter know the food and the ingredients but its especially great when they know the wine list. Great food, came out in a timely manner. Very pleasant dining experience.

We took are time with dinner as we were caught uo in conversation. The wait staff was attentive, however, I felt they wanted to rush us a bit after a couple hours at the table. All in all the restaurant and staff were good and I'll return.

Their prix fixe menu is unbelievable and leaves no one hungry after the three course presentation. But beyond that, the service is impeccable, the wine list truly exceptional, and last, but not least, the food is prepared so well that you think you're dining in a five star environment. This is meal to be thoroughly enjoyed.

February 14, 2012|Nice try.|1|Ordered/Charged for Woodford Reserve and was given Jim Beam. This insult goes deeper than just not enjoying my drink. It is a big screw you to the customer direct from the owner and because of this I could not stomach anything else for the rest of the evening. If they are cutting costs at the bar where else are they doing the same? Not for me at all. Too bad you can't even pay for quality these days.
February 14, 2012|My husband and I hadn't gone|5|My husband and I hadn't gone out for Valentine's Day in I don't know how many years. With two young children it's not as easy as it used to be. We could't have chosen a better restaurant for the occasion. The food was so delicious. My husband had a lightly veal chop with a bolognese and homemade wagonwheel pasta that was so spectacular. So much so that my most amazing veal chop couldn't even compare. Thank you Pane e Vino for a most memorable meal!
February 14, 2012|We adore Pane e Vino.  We|5|We adore Pane e Vino. We were here for Valentine's day dinner and it was very special. Our most special experience at this restaurant was when they opened the restaurant to us on a Saturday afternoon for my husband's father's memorial. We had a four course meal for about 30 people with an open bar. The staff was outstanding and took care of our every need. There were video screens at either end of the room so that we were able to present a slide show during our meal, which was lovely. We were even offered valet parking. It couldn't have been a nicer way to honor and remember my father-in-law. We are forever grateful for our experience at Pane e Vino. Highly recommend this restaurant!
February 14, 2012|Duck Confit - WOW!|5|WOW! Went for V-day and was not disappointed! There is a reason why they have been rated Best Providence Restaurant year after year! We started with an assortment of breads that they offer you will oil. Very tasty. I then ordered the beet salad with goat cheese & pecans. So refreshing! Wonderful flavors together! For dinner, my husband got the lobster ravioli and he loved it. I ordered the Duck Confit with Mascarpone & Fig ravioli in a shallot cream sauce. WOW. Those were my 1st words. One of the best meals I've ever had! The flavors together were Ah-mazing! Absolutely perfect! I Highly Recommend this restaurant! YUM!

Very crowded, noise level high, tables on top of one another, bar area very small thus waiting for a table is very uncomfortable. There is no where to stand. There are too many other great restaurants in Providence to put this in my Top 10.
February 11, 2012|Pane e Vino was very good.|4|Pane e Vino was very good. The service from valet parking to the attentive and friendly wait staff was exceptional. We had the calamari and the anti pasta misto for our appetizers - both were outstanding and are recommended. We had the scallop entree with a very generous portion deliciously roasted brussel sprouts. The scallops were large and seared perfectly but could have used more seasoning. We also had the pasta with ragu, meatballs and sausage. The pasta and sauce were fantastic. The flavor and texture of the meatballs and the sausage were just OK as if overcooked in the sauce. Finally, they gladly offered custom half-orders of pasta - very nice. We will definitely go back.

The food was superb, the staff was incredible, and the overall experience was notable. Unlike most places, they have a $19.95 prix fixe menu that can fill up the hungriest of diners with top notch food. Pane Vino will definitely get a second visit soon!
February 2, 2012|The food was delicious, if|4|"The food was delicious, if a tad expensive, but there was a clear hierarchy to the restaurant. Most everyone who showed up was in a business suit, and stared oddly at those who did not seem to meet their ""standards."" The service was fine, though some our empty water glasses were ignored with frequency, but for the most part, every attempt was made to make our time at Pane e Vino pleasant. The artwork and ambiance are fantastic, and add to the overall rustic yet classy Italian feel of the restaurant."
February 2, 2012|Superb & Romantic Dining|5|Pane e Vino is our favorite restaurant. The food, service and ambiance are first class. Each time we visit with friends at Pane e Vino the experience is more memorable than the last visit.

February 1, 2012|Great as always. In an area|4|"Great as always. In an area of somewhat pretentious, yet often excellent, restaurants, Pane e Vino continuously shines. Their trattoria menu is great, offering solid value for your money. The regular menu offers a nice range of different items, with some really good integration of local products. They're annual $20 gift via email for your birthday is a wonderful idea, especially in today's economy, and goes far beyond the traditional ""stop in for a free piece of cake"" concept. Best of all, and I tell all my friends this, is the food is consistently delicious. I have never had a bad experience."

Dined on December 18, 2011|Overall a very good experience.|5|Overall a very good experience. We had a great table in front window, great food as always and very good, attentive service from Richard. Just a nice, relaxing restaurant on a Sunday eve where you can always count on fine food with a nice menu.
December 17, 2011|Great Food, Great Service|4|Loved the food, the service was great. Only flaw, we had reservations at 8:30 pm and we were seated at 9:40 pm. The manager bought all of us a round of drinks and they also paid for appetizers and had them ready right when we sat down. I would definitely go again, hopefully, they can improve on their system of turning tables. Although, this time of year I know people are celebrating the Holidays, 1 hour and 10 minutes is too long of a wait.

The overall ambience is romantic, cozy, warm and wonderful. The entire staff is warm, friendly and accommodating it makes for a marvelous and enjoyable evening.
December 11, 2011|Definitely would go back!|5|Brought some friends from out of town, they were very impressed. The food was top notch and the service was just as good. Always had a drink refilled right away, the staff was all personable and friendly. The Nutella cheesecake for dessert was outstanding! Definitely would go back
December 11, 2011|we both ordered the price|4|we both ordered the price fixe for $19.95 appetizer through dessert.....what a deal. Food was all very good. The only issue is that despite it was a slow Sunday afternoon, we were seated near the bar and the bartender was also our waiter. Service was very slow overall and took a long time to get our courses.

December 5, 2011|Great Celebration|5|Went to celebrate a birthday, it was a great experience overall. Dessert was served with a candle for the birthday girl, and the servers even sang! The food was flavorful and the portions were plenty. From the valet, servers and bussers, the service was great. I would definitely go back.

December 3, 2011|The food was great. My only|4|The food was great. My only issue was that we had reservations and still had to wait 40 minutes after our reservation for our assigned table. The hostess was somewhat unfriendly, though someone else did come over and offered a drink on the house for the inconvenience. They could use better table/reservation management as I've read this isn't uncommon. The food, however, was so good I'd still go back.
December 1, 2011|Good as N End Boston|4|My wife and I consider Pane e Vino as good as most North End Boston restaurants. The swordfish was excellent with a generous serving size and light sauce. The calamari fritti antipasti was good but could have used more calamari and less hot peppers. The service was as good as it gets.
November 26, 2011|Took our daughter and hubby|3|Took our daughter and hubby for their anniversary. Choose Pane e Vino due it's being named best restaurant. It was okay, but disappointing. Not what we expected. Everything was just okay. Felt like a diner with linen - long and narrow. Food was just medium. Portions were on the small side.
November 20, 2011|Poor Service|3|I have eaten here before and have had lovely dinners. But tonight the help was off. Our post theater dinner was two hours long due to the service. I pushed the waiter to take our order. The food was good but the waiter was slow. We waited a long time for our appertizers and our meals. I even went and found our waiter to give him our bill. My daughter had homework to do and we didn't think dinner was going to be that long. We will not rush back, the restaurant was not that busy for a Sunday night so that was not the problem.
November 19, 2011|Buon mangiare!|4|Great night celebrating our anniversary! The Prosseco toast was a great start to our evening. Service was great - timely, attentive. Server made great suggestions for dinner and wine. Food was delicious - Calamari Fritti was flavorful, appropriate portion size. The Insalata di Barbabietole was a delight with generous slices of red and gold beets topped with candied pecans and goat cheese. The Veal chop and Filet Mignon were prepared to perfection, accompanied by delicious sides. Sweet ending with the Chocolate Tortina and cappuccinos!
November 19, 2011|Excellent meal with fresh|5|Excellent meal with fresh local foods, it reminded me of the food on my recent trip to the Amalfi Coast!!!! Service was excellent!!!! It is my favorite restaurant! The antipasto salad could be a dinner with a bottle of wine! The second courses were excellent! We were too full for desert but I am sure they are delicious!!

November 14, 2011|One of my favorites in Providence|5|"I am a frequent diner at Pane e Vino and consider it one of my favorite restaurants in Providence. I have learned that probably the best place to sit if you want to converse with your guests is toward the front windows--that area tends to have a bit more ""sound proofing"" from the rest of the diners. Otherwise, the middle area of the restaurant can get rather loud at times and it makes it difficult to hear the people at your table. Regarding the food--you simply cannot go wrong. Out of the two or three dozen times I have been there, I have only had one meal come out to me that I thought was not good--and the manager immediately took the plate away and came back shortly with a new meal that was fantastic! In short, I love this place."
November 12, 2011|Despite having a reservation|2|Despite having a reservation for two, we waited for 30 minutes. The restaurant was extremely busy and loud. The service was very slow, so slow in fact that we had finished a bottle of wine before our entrees even arrived. When our entrees did arrive, one of our orders was incorrect. The server immediately took the plate away, leaving my date with her food. Then the waiter arrived to explain that I had ordered incorrectly, and the mistake was on my part not his. As I was explaining that I simply ordered off the menu, the manager arrived to wave him away. When my entree did arrive, it was burnt and over cooked (veal chop) and clearly cooked in haste due to the miscommunication. No one apologized. Awful dining experience
November 12, 2011|What happened|3|This must have been a night of for the restaurant and the crew. Service was rushed. The food was mediocre at best.

I got the bread pudding for desert it was amazing and I think my husband got the gelato. The owner sent us a complimnatary Lemencillo which was a nice,I would Not consider this a ""Romantic""restaurant"
November 12, 2011|Stay away!|1|2 of our 4 meals needed to be sent back for being so poorly prepared and of such poor quality. The veal was to tough to eat and the duck was very over cooked to the point of being as dry as shoe leather. And for this we had the pleasure of waiting over an hour for our food to even arrive at the table. My quests wife ordered the butternut squash Risotto and it was so bland, as if the white rice came from a bag, with I swear only one small square of squash on the dish.

We were very pleased with the food quality and service was wonderful. The ""little oranges"" appetizer (crab cake) was AMAZING! We had read reviews about the calamari being spectacular and had to try it, but we found it to be fairly good. I got the ragu napolitano, which was featured on Food Network for the meatballs, and it was excellent. My husband tried a salmon special and the fish was cooked perfectly. He was not a big fan of the lentils that came with it, but he doesn't like lentils in general. The cannoli for dessert was to die for and the nutella cheesecake was very good as well. Definitely will go back again, especially for the ""little oranges."""

October 19, 2011|Though, from a food perspective,|3|"Though, from a food perspective, our meals were excellent, the experience was a little disappointing relative to the many reviews that I have seen for this restaurant including it being one of the top RI restaurants based on RI Monthly reader voting. My hope is that this was a one time issue. The negative aspect of the experience was due to an extremely long wait for our meal. The explanation given was that it was due to having a large party that the kitchen got backed up while focusing on getting the parties meals out. My feeling is that if you are going to have large parties, the restaurant should not let the rest of their diners pay the price as they ""should"" be as important as the large party."
October 19, 2011|Not my best experience at|2|Not my best experience at P+V. House cab had barrel taste. Veal chop not cooked even after returning it.

October 15, 2011|Try during the week|3|I Guess Being a Top Rated Restaurant has its draw backs. Very Busy, Always people waiting. I ordered a Veal Osso Bucco special. The pasta was either old (made fresh) or undercooked. The shank was delicious.

The beet salad was delish, the wine was good and it was the special bottle so reasonably priced., but two of us had the saltimbocca and felt the same way. Others had the fish of the night and that was better. Don't know if I'd go back.

The wait person did say it had a tomato based sauce but it was too thick and heavy for veal. It also came so hot that I couldn't eat it until the rest of my table was finished their meals.

Since nothing was available, we took a walk around the neighborhood. Upon returning, we waited an additional 45 minutes. I am not quite sure what the issue was but there seemed to be many large parties and that may have been the issue. The waitress seemed rushed and not fully trained. Both my friend and I had veal and we agreed tht while it was good; it was not great. I think I would try the restaurant again but not on a ""waterfire"" night. It did not seem to me that the restaurant was worthy of all the awards that it has received."

It sounded like a nice idea, but we were sat down near the end of the building where some very inconsiderate patrons would congregate to smoke. I felt forgotten outside as we waited a very long time in between getting sat and ordering. When the check came, we waited for at least 15minutes before I went inside the restaurant looking for the waitress. I do enjoy this restaurant, and will return, but on this occasion, it was unpleasant, and embarrassing because I had highly recommended the experience to my guest.

The windows were open - as the weather was absolutely beautiful. We were served bread and olive oil in which to dip it. All of us ordered pasta dishes which were served in a reasonable amount of time. None of us were able to finish our meal, so we had some take-home. We enjoyed cups of regular coffee. Unfortunately, no one had room for dessert. We loved our food and the service from an attentive staff. Previously, I attended 2 Birthday celebrations. This was my first visit with my wife and two friends. We'll be back, often. (Did I mention we loved it?)

My wife trusted the waitress to surprise her with a vegetarian entree. Her fresh, hand-made pasta was wonderful, and the marinara was incredible. My veal was prepared perfectly. Both of us had too much to finish. The wine list more than pleased. They deserved their rating in Wine Spectator. We would return in an instant. At the end, we thanked the manager for the whole experience. She answered with glasses of homemade orangecello. Superb overall.

The wine selection was very good although some selections seemed overpriced (e.g. the Nero D'Avola!.

We made reservations looking for a romantic table. If you saw the tv show they were spot on. If you live in RI your missing out if you haven't visited Pane e Vino, if your planning a trip to RI it's a must go to resturant. The atmosphere was inviting, service was exceptional. and the food was outstanding. I plan to visit Pane e Vino whenever I visit RI.
July 16, 2011|Must go to Pane e Vino|5|"I was looking for a special place to dine with friends who are real foodies. Pane e Vino had a couple of good reviews so I booked the table. My friend checked out the menu online and said it looked interesting. For some reason, on the drive down we looked at the reviews and got worried about a couple of the not so good ones and almost didn't go. Thank goodness we went. I saw an old friend and her husband celebrating an anniversary who were raving about the food they just ate. It was restaurant week so three of my friends ordered from that menu and had the salmon. It was delicious. I ordered scallops from the regular menu and was very pleased. Appetizers and desserts were also excellent--I highly recommend the ""liquid dessert"" on the menu."

July 2, 2011|Pane e Vino is on Providence's|3|Pane e Vino is on Providence's vibrant Federal Hill. I was a little put off when the call confirming reservations asked me to show up half an hour early. I agreed, since it made little difference, but that struck me as odd. When we arrived we were seated at a small table jammed in with a bunch of other people when there was plenty of room in the rest of the dining room. As we completed our main course, a busboy came by several times to ask if he could clear our table - before we were finished. NOT GOOD. The wine list is excellent, and our starters were very good. Both of us were disappointed in the main courses. There was nothing wrong with them, but they weren't special. We'll go to Camille's next time we're on Federal Hill.
June 25, 2011|Very lovely restaurant. Food|5|Very lovely restaurant. Food and service exceptional. Would definitely recommend.
June 24, 2011|Two friends of mine, who both|5|Two friends of mine, who both happen to be chef's, recommended Pane e Vino to me. I finally was able to go. The ambiance was perfect and the menu looked so inviting. I chose the duck confit and my guests made different choices so that I was able to sample different dishes. The food was excellent across the board, including the dessert that my guests shared. I was still thinking of the duck confit the next day! LOVED it! The pairing with the duck of ravioli stuffed with figs, toasted walnuts Y mascarpone with walnut cream sauce.......absolutely delectable!
June 22, 2011|Been to Pane E Vino on a number|3|Been to Pane E Vino on a number of occasions. This was not a good night for the restaurant. We have been very happy with the food in the past but this trip was not up to their normal standards.
June 13, 2011|Initially service was a little|4|Initially service was a little on the slow side, but the revamped itself to satisfy our needs to attend a concert. Expect to spend at least two hours dining. Everything about the food was great.
June 11, 2011|I found the restaurant very|4|I found the restaurant very appealing although a bit noisy (it was saturday night so...). The food was excellent we ate varied dishes and the quality, taste, and portions for them all were excellent. Veal dishes were tasty as was the seafood risotto. The chopped sausage made the rigatoni in a pink sauce really tasty. There were six of us and the service was good, accommodating and unpretentious! The Proprietor's selection on the wine worked really well and reasonably priced. I tried the connoli for desert and no one really liked the caramel coating; It no longer tasted like a connoli. Nonetheless, I would return in a heartbeat.
June 11, 2011|We went to this restaurant|3|We went to this restaurant to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary. We selected the restaurant on-line. The food was good and the wait staff was excellent. We were hoping the restaurand to be more romantice for the event We would recommend the restaurant to our friends and revisit the restaurant.
June 10, 2011|you won't be disappointed|5|Food was some of the best I had at Federal Hill and I've tried about 7-8 different restraurants in the federal hill area, they are all good but this was my fav. Service was also excellent. Seating a bit tight and a very small bar (6 seats)
June 4, 2011|Best antipasto I have ever had|4|Best antipasto I have ever had. For my entree I had the bolagnase and it was very good. Wife had the pasta with red sauce but the red sauce was vert bland. Sangria was also very good, more of a wine taste than a fruity taste. Would go back but would stay away from the red sauce. Again, the antipasto was to die for!
June 3, 2011|Great food & Atmosphere|5|The bread pudding is to die for! From the moment we walked in to the moment we left - a great experience. The staff was accommodating and very friendly! Definitely will return.
May 29, 2011|The menu showed a lot of creativity|4|The menu showed a lot of creativity. The wait staff understand that no plates should be cleared from the table until everyone is finished with their course.
May 28, 2011|We went to celbrate our daughters|3|We went to celbrate our daughters birtday and asked for a special table. We were seated right in from of the kitchen doors. It was extremly hot. The food was good but not exceptional. The prices were right up there with the restaurants on the hill. Don't think I will come back again. There are a lot of other restarants that need to be tried on Federal Hill. Our server was exceptional and we did not wait for our table.
May 27, 2011|I wasn't terribly impressed.|3|I wasn't terribly impressed. The charcuterie plate was the best thing on the menu. Nothing anyone had was bad, but nothing was terribly noteworthy either.
May 20, 2011|VERY DISAPPOINTED|3|"While the waitstaff was ""Italian"" and very attentive and knowledgeable - the food fell very short of expectations. My husband ordered a $34 ribeye steak which was about 1/4# thick and very small. A few potatoes on the plate - very very disappointed. The Sangria I ordered tasted like fruit punch and had about as much of a ""punch"" to it. Would never go back."

May 8, 2011|great mothers day gift|5|Service was a bit slow but overall a good experience. Food was good, i had the pork tenderloin. It was delicious. And the apples in the meal were suprisingly delicious. Great wine list. I did feel like i was in italy.
May 8, 2011|Very Pleasant staff. Food|3|Very Pleasant staff. Food was good but not as fabulous tasting as some of the previous reviews. We'll keep trying other Atwell St. establishments before we return.
May 7, 2011|Great food & atmosphere!|5|We dined on a Saturday night, the restaurant was very busy but we were seated on time for our reservation. Service was outstanding (Nicole) and the food was incredible. The warm atmosphere makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable! The duck confit is out of this world; we also had the calamari and the provola which were wonderful starters. We will be back again, and again.
Dined on May 7, 2011|Great place, great food however,|4|Great place, great food however, my dish did NOT meet expectations. The pork with Tartuffo was dry at best and not tasty. I will not order it again. However, my daughter ordered the Duck Confit with fig ravioli and it was delicious.
April 24, 2011|My wife and I are in our sixties|5|My wife and I are in our sixties and over the years have experienced many resturants,we are not experts in dining but we know quality and consistency and PANE e VINO is absolutly a great dining choice
April 24, 2011|This was our third trip back|4|This was our third trip back to Pane e Vino and I would definitely go back again. It offers high quality food and service in a warm, inviting, yet unassuming atmosphere.
April 18, 2011|From the fresh baked bread,|5|From the fresh baked bread, still warm, served at the start of our meal to the delicious flourless chocolate cake at the end, we enjoyed an Italian meal that exceeded our expectations. Our waiter was attentive yet unobtrusive.
April 16, 2011|Disappointed|2|"We started our night feeling hopeful. The knowledgable bartender was happy to recommend wine selections that were perfect. We were seated promptly at our reserved time. Multiple waitstaff immediately swarmed our table with their offerings. Ordered calamari arrived almost too quickly, but was delicious. Unfortunately, the rest of the night featured erratically inattentive staff, a forty-five minute wait for mediocre entrees and ultimate disappointment. The spaghetti con vongole was ruined by an overwhelming saltiness from cubes of pancetta and grit with every chew; surprisingly little clam flavor in the sauce despite the presence of fresh (gritty) clams. A pasta dish featured an uninspiring ""ragu"", although the pasta itself tasted homemade."
April 16, 2011|A superb dining experience|5|We celebrated my birthday Saturday night and were treated with outstanding service by Hillary. She was perfect in explaining the menu items, talking to us in a friendly yet professional way. She knew exactly when to be there and when to let us be. The food without exception was outstanding. I, again, had the veal chop which was done to perfection...again, as suggested by Hillary. And the surprise Happy Birthday at the end of our wonderful meal just took the entire experience over the top! We have passed along your name to other friends who are desperately looking for a fine Federal Hill restaurant, having been disappointed many times. I am sure they will be visiting
April 15, 2011|The duck confit over fig raviolis|4|The duck confit over fig raviolis with a walnut cream sauce was a masterful creation.....and delicious.

April 7, 2011|Service food and management|5|"Service food and management were top notch, we were looking for a place to ""make our home"" and I think we found it...squared away restaurant."
April 4, 2011|Romantic hotspot in Providence.|4|This is a great small restaurant for a romantic meal that is not overly pricey. Getting there before 7pm is a good idea, as the Trattoria pre-fix menu is an excellent value. (Not available on Saturdays) I'd highly recommend visiting on a Monday night for their 1/2 off wine selection. Starters and deserts have always been fantastic. Pasta is excellent. Parmigiana dishes are good, but have been a bit dry on occasion. Seafood has always been superb.
April 3, 2011|It was my second time at Pane|5|It was my second time at Pane E Vino, and I say that it gets better every time. The food is always beyond my expectations. My boyfriend and I are culinary students and we can honestly say that it is top notch.
April 1, 2011|Pasta cardinale and halibut|5|Pasta cardinale and halibut speacial (Friday, April 1) were both fantastic! Service was very good - thanks for a great experience!
March 25, 2011|I was a little alarmed after|5|I was a little alarmed after reading other reviews of folks waiting 45+ minutes for a table even with reservations but we arrived 10 minutes early and were seated immediately (Friday night - 6:30pm). Server made an excellent wine recommendation and the food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend Pane e Vino - you won't be dissappointed!
March 19, 2011|The food and service were|4|The food and service were great but didn't find it too romantic because the tables are so close together and could hear conversations on both sides of me. I also had to sqeeze between tables if I needed to use the facilities. It was our anniversary and birthday celebration so would have preferred a more quieter setting.
March 18, 2011|Bella Italia in Providence RI|5|Outstanding and authentic Italiano Ristorante! We're going again and again.
March 18, 2011|My wife and I don't go out|4|My wife and I don't go out that frequently, but when we do, Pane e Vino is always on the list of options. Never had a bad experience there. The hostess was very accomodating and offered us an alternative table so I did'nt have to sit next to the hallway. Our server was excellent and the timing of the kitchen was perfect. Nobody is trying to rush you there. We had the Caprese and the Calamari, two classics, very well prepared, the Calamari super tender. The risotto frutti di mare and the fish of the day were both perfectly prepared. The wine list is my absolute favorite in this restaurant, a great selection of some not so well known, yet outstanding labels.
March 17, 2011|Great food and service|5|The food was excellent and the service was superb! The waiter was very attentive without being intrusive. Everything about our experience here was top notch and will definitely eat at Pane e Vino again and again!
March 17, 2011|We've been big fans of Pan|5|We've been big fans of Pan e Vino for a number of years. Joe DeQuattro has been doing a great job. The food is consistently great and there are no variations between visits. The servers are fantastic and extremely knowledgable. I especially enjoy the olives from Itri that are put on the table.
March 17, 2011|I used to recommend this restaurant|1|I used to recommend this restaurant to anyone who asked for a suggestion. I was compeletely disappointed with all aspects of my last visit to Pane e Vino. I will not be returning because of the lack of effort the manager showed in regards to compensating me for waiting 40 minutes for a reserved table. I requested a certain table because of our special occasion. I agreed to sit somewhere else so that we could finally eat. Service was very slow and two dinners were burnt. I will not be recommending or visiting this restaurant again.

March 11, 2011|Terrific food, presentation,|4|Terrific food, presentation, and service. The only dissapointment was their inability to fulfil our request for a large round or square-ish table for our party of 10. As is always the caseOur long, rectangular table did not foster a sense of 'togetherness'.
March 11, 2011|The food was fresh and handmade.|4|The food was fresh and handmade. It was amazing. The flavors were complex and the meal was cooked to perfection. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food and wine.
March 6, 2011|Would not go back.|3|The Antipasti Misto was fabulous - though a bit pricey. Our waiter, Matt, was excellent and I would highly recommend him if you decide to go. The lighting over our table keep going dim at times, which was very annoying! Our meals were OK but not great and would go back to other restaurants before I dine here again.
March 5, 2011|A great intro to Federal Hill|4|Pane e Vino was a great way to start our Federal Hill experience. They've set the bar pretty high for the second place we go to. The tiny bar was packed, so it took five minutes to get a wine list and another ten holding it before our table was ready - no wine for us... Our resposive server resolved that immediately by guiding us to the featured Italian red - delicious - we got two bottles. We started with nice caprese salad and a phenominal arancini. The seafood risotto was great. As for the veal saltimbocca, they left out the prosciutto. There was so much red sauce and cheese, it seemed more like unbreaded parmisan. But the sauce was great, so I ate it and cleaned the plate with bread. Any small hiccups had silver-linings - 4 stars.
March 5, 2011|Lovely restaurant, very good|2|Lovely restaurant, very good food, beautiful antipasti for four, the Baumster scallops were delicious, but the service was extremely slow. I don't think I can convince my friends to return. This was on Saturday, 3-5-11.

March 3, 2011|Never dissapoints through|5|Never dissapoints through our many visits over the years. It's nice never to be taken for granted by the staff. Pane e Vino realizes the worth of public relations so always offers special gifts, e.g., birthday discounts, Monday wine discounts, etc., that demonstrate they appreciate our patronage.

February 26, 2011|Long wait but good food|4|"The restaurant was very busy. We checked in with the hostess upon arrival and she told us it ""was going to be a while,"" before our table was ready. We went to the bar and had a glass of wine. We were eventually sat 40 minutes after our reserved time for dinner. The manager and the waiter both apologized for the delay in getting us seated. The food came right away but then we felt rushed through our antipasto platter so they could drop of our entrees. The food was delicious and the wine selection vast. I would go again, but won't count on a reservation to get me seated any faster than a walk in."
February 26, 2011|Disappointed|1|"We made reservations for 8:00pm on a Saturday. We waited 45 MINUTES to be seated amongst many other people who were unhappy they were waiting also. I watched 2 couples finally walk out the door after waiting well over a half hour. During our wait to be seated, the woman who I assumed to be manager, would periodically yell at the hostess who was visibly upset. None of the staff checked in on the people who were waiting or apologized. Expecting great food based on ""Best of Providence"" award, we were disappointed. I ordered a short rib and polenta which was a special, and my fiance ordered a sausage and meatball fusilli. They were just OK. The restaurant itself was nothing special. I would not go back there or recommend it to anyone."

February 19, 2011|There were a few dissapointments|3|There were a few dissapointments with Pane e Vino. For one, because we were only two people dining we were placed at a small table in a room with two large boisterous groups of people. The second was that the online menu, was not the same as the restaurant menu and I was limited a to what I could eat. The food was good- but not great compared to other establishments on the Hill.
February 19, 2011|Early Diner after the afternoon|5|Early Diner after the afternoon show of The Lion King...what a great day. When on the Hill and in the mood for a great meal and experience, I always choose Pane e Vino. From the moment you take advantage of the free valet parking on a very busy Saturday, you know you are in for a great experience. Once seated (to a very nice table) we settled in for our meal. We started with a bean and broth dish served over bread which absord it all, OUT OF THIS WORLD! For diner we went with scallops for one of the dishes and fresh pasta and meatballs for the other. Both were great arriving at the table piping hot and done to perfection. We ended with cannolli served with a crispy shell and full of cream. The night in a word was OUTSTANDING!
February 18, 2011|We were seated right away.|3|We were seated right away. We had a reservation for 6pm, but called to see if we could be seated for 5:15. Our waiter provided good service as was able to answer any questions. My husband asked if something special could be made and said it could. The bread was excellent and delivered right away - a rustic italian and some focaccia. That was served with some olive oil and salt. The caesar salads were just okay. My husband ended up with the rack of lamb special. Nothing spectacular and way too chewy to enjoy. I had the linguini and clam sauce. This plate was less than spectacular (looked good). My son had a veal dish that had SOOO much lemon you couldn't taste anything else. Good ambience. Good wine. Next time, we'll try somewhere else.
February 16, 2011|This is a nice restaurant|4|This is a nice restaurant on Federal Hill where the food is very good. We dined on a Wednesday evening and the service was good but not great. We had to flag down the server several times who would stop and then say she would get back to us. The restaurant was fairly busy and quite noisy.
February 15, 2011|Food was AMAZING from start|5|Food was AMAZING from start to finish. Highly recommend it. Great place to have a Valentine's Day dinner. Service was very good too as he was quite attentive but, not overbearing. Exactly how I like it. I'll be back
February 14, 2011|Slow Service|3|Everything was great but our server seemed to get hung up at times towards the middle of our meal. By the time my date and I were finished eating, it took about an hour to receive the dessert menu, order, receive our bill, and receive my credit card back. Towards the end of the night I just couldn't wait to get out of the place.
February 13, 2011|Service was great. Our waiter|3|Service was great. Our waiter was very friendly. Food was ok (medium well Steak was burnt) and flavors were ok. Desserts were great. For the price, food was below average. I might try it one more time before giving up on the restaurant as I have heard good reviews about the restaurant and the ambiance was great.
February 12, 2011|Popular with good reason|3|Excellent food, and a place I'd love to come for a non-holiday weekend. On Valentine's day weekend It was extremely crowded. Our reservations were for 9:00 and we weren't seated until 9:45, which was extremely frustrating. There were several people waiting such that there was hardly any space to stand. Once we were seated, the tables were very close, but our waiter was good and food was excellent. This was the second year in a row we chose Pane e Vino for Valentines Day and as we value tradition and good food will probably return next year and hope our table is ready upon or shortly after our reservation time.
February 12, 2011|Great food, rough night|2|My fiance and I are getting married in Providence and took my parents to Pane e Vino to show them one of our favorite restaurants on the Hill. Unfortunately, it was Valentine's weekend and we didn't get sat until 9:45 for our 8:30 reservation. I understand running behind, but that was a bit much especially because there is no place to wait so you are constantly being elbowed and jostled while you wait. Despite that, the food was great as usually and our waiter was one of the best we've had anywhere. After dinner, the valet was taking a bit longer than expected so we walked around the corner to find that our car was being towed. That was a pretty miserable end to a night that ran much later than planned (it was midnight at this point).
February 12, 2011|Perfection!|5|We would like to thank you for a WONDERFUL evening! Everything was perfection! Such a friendly and happy staff ... very accommodating and the food is just delicious! The atmosphere was really 'Old World' ... intimate, warm, cozy, ... perfect! Noise level was a bit much, but not intolerable. It was Saturday night, after all!

February 11, 2011|We have dined at PaneVino|5|"We have dined at PaneVino several times and had wonderful meals. However Friday night was an exception. At our server's recommendation my husband had the chicken special which was described as prepared ""with a brick on top"" during the baking. The chicken was very diappointing...dry, extremely salty and unremarkable. We did share this information with our server who graciously accepted it and said she would tell the chef. My entree, the scallops, were wonderful and beautifully prepared. I was not able to type this in the ""private note to the restaurant"" for some reason."
February 6, 2011|This used to be our favorite|2|This used to be our favorite restaurant. I don't know what happened here-whether they have a new chef or what - but the food is definitely not what it used to be. Especially the tomato sauce, which is pretty important in an italian restaurant. It just doesn't taste good at all.
February 4, 2011|This was our first visit to|4|This was our first visit to Pane e Vino but will not be our last -- the atmosphere was upbeat, fun and lively! Our server, Ben was outstanding and totally on his game; he never missed a beat and was friendly; always a warm smile on his face -- was great at recommending a fine Italian wine (we ordered two bottles!) The bussing staff was also very professional and friendly - on a scale of one to ten, I give Pane e Vino a ten for its' service and quality of food!

January 28, 2011|Went to Pane e Vino based|3|Went to Pane e Vino based on reviews on Open Table and Chowhound. We were there to celebrate a birthday- our table was horrible- we were seated (table for 2) in the back of the restaurant amongst the larger dinner parties- the one nearest us had about 20 people at it. Felt like I was imposing on their party. Food was good but pretty cold and definitely took way too long- 2 1/2 hours for dinner for 2? Not sure if I would go back here.

January 22, 2011|Great food, so-so service|3|Arrived at 8:25 for an 8:30 reservation. My wife was on crutches, & I didn't want her to have to wait long to be seated. We were not seated until 9:15, 45 minutes late. Our waiter did not offer us any bread and also did not inform us of any specials. The food was excellent. I was disappointed with the long wait, especially since the bar area was full and there was really nowhere to sit or stand. I was also disappointed with the waiter. He did not offer us any bread and didn't tell us of the specials. Yet, he brought bread to the table next to us and he told them of the specials. Unfortunately, we had already ordered.

Keep it up, its working. Jim

December 27, 2010|Pane y Vino is one of my favorite|4|Pane y Vino is one of my favorite Italian restaurants amongst the many on Federal Hill. This was my second time dining there, the first being on Valentine's Day, and I had a great meal both times. This time, we went on a Monday evening to take advantage of the 1/2 price wine deal on Mondays, which was well worth it. The prix fixe menu was also fantastic- a salad course, a main course, and a dessert and coffee or tea for $19.95! I didn't think this was a place I would find value, but the prix fixe menu was definitely well worth the price. I had a house salad, veal parmesan, and tiramisu and coffee... it was just the right amount of food and you couldn't beat the value! I highly recommend Pane y Vino for all occasions!!
December 27, 2010|Monday night was half price|4|Monday night was half price wine night and we enjoyed some very nice wines at an attractive price!

The food was excellent with one exception and the service was what I would expect of a restaurant of this quality. The only downside was having to wait 30 minutes past our reservation time for our table.

December 19, 2010|Exceptional food and a very|5|Exceptional food and a very good wine list. This restaurant was recommended by a friend. We went for our anniversary and was not disappointed. All of the food was fresh and very well prepared. We love their rollatini and it was the first time in a long time we received a truly fresh, crunchy sweet cannoli with a hint of cinnamon. This is a new favorite for special occasions.
December 17, 2010|Service phenomenal. I liked|5|Service phenomenal. I liked the atmosphere, but if you are looking for something quiet and cozy, this wouldn't be the place on a Friday or Saturday. Food was delicious and they made substitutions since my diet is restrictive. I highly recommend!
December 15, 2010|This has to be one of the|5|This has to be one of the best Italian joints on the Hill. I have tried about half a dozen and this is by far my favorite. The food is phenomenal. I have a hard time deciding what to eat because everything looks so good. I really enjoy the ambiance as well. The bar is loungy and hip, while the tabletops are romantic and high class. Best of all is the service. There are plenty specials each evening and the wait staff know each inside and out. I can't wait to go back!
December 11, 2010|We have been going to Pane|5|We have been going to Pane e vino for at least 7 years, although we have not gone in about 3 years when we made this recent trip. Met old friends for dinner without children. The wine list is amazing, the food, even better. We sat, talked, drank wine and ate dinner for 2 1/2 hours and never once did we feel like they were trying to quickly get us to leave the table so another group could sit. The waitress gave us our space but was there when we needed her. We love going and whenever we can get a sitter, we will go to Pane e Vino
December 9, 2010|Great wine selection as always.|4|Great wine selection as always. Food and service were good and friendly. We asked for a well-done steak tough it came kind-of burnt. They apologized and offered to replace it with stg else and desserts were on the house showing their feeling sorry about this. This is a one-off we'll go there again.

The restaurant served us very well and didn't complain about our rowdy group monopolizing their attention on a Monday night. We'd definitely go back. The half price wine on Mondays made it quite the bargain as well.

The issue I had was making the reservation online and arriving only to find they said they had no record of my reservation. Thankfully it was early (7:00 pm) and they could accommodate us.

October 30, 2010|Another great experience! |5|Being big Italian fans my husband and I have dined at Pane numerous times. We've always had spectacular service, even while dining at the bar -- it can be hard to find the same level of food service when seated at the bar, but not here. The fresh and local ingredients are big plus for us, we enjoy frequenting restaurants that support local farms, etc as we try to do the same at home. I think their breads are from Lasalle, but I'm not positive about that. The restaurant is consistently busy on weekends, but not in an obnoxiously long wait kind of way, we haven't had to wait more then 5 minutes w/reservations. Nice spot during the summer if you can get a seat near the open windows. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been...
October 30, 2010|Our crew had very tasty meals|4|Our crew had very tasty meals once we sat down (had a 40 min wail). Though the veal shank was quite tasty, it was a bit fatty. Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable,but spoke very fast - a bit hard to understand. The ambiance was pleasant, especially given a window seat. Over all it was a very nice nite out.
October 29, 2010|Dined early at the bar as|5|Dined early at the bar as this place gets crowded early & quickly, especially on the weekends. Erin at the bar was well-informed, friendly, and efficient. Each course was as good as the last and we had a completely enjoyable night. The wine list is extensive and should satisfy any heady wine lover. The bread, the olive oil, the salad, arancini and the healthy wheat pasta with either shrimp or sausage were all incredibly tasty! The tiramasu was great as well!
October 23, 2010|We had a wonderful meal, and|4|We had a wonderful meal, and dining at Pane e Vino has become a tradition for us when we visit our son for Brown Family Weekend. The food was wonderful, ambiance is special and yet comfortable and friendly. Our server was helpful and nice, but service seemed slower than usual. Perhaps they were short staffed? Nevertheless, we had a wonderful experience, and appreciated the option of ordering a half-sized pasta dish for our 9 year old's entree...he was able to choose his own pasta and sauce, which we really appreciated.
October 22, 2010|Very good food. We all enjoyed|4|"Very good food. We all enjoyed our meals very much, especially our pasta dishes. But we had an 8 PM reservation and were not seated until almost 9 PM. The restaurant staff were somewhat apologetic, and after about 40 minutes they did serve some free (and tasty)appetizers to the large crowd waiting for tables. (We were not the only ones who had to wait for quite a while, even with a reservation.) But making someone with a reservation wait for a table for almost an hour is pretty inexcusable. As Jerry Seinfeld would have said, ""They knew how to take the reservation, but they didn't know how to keep the reservation."""

October 20, 2010|Great meal, lots of offerings|4|Great meal, lots of offerings on the menu and with specials. Despite the name of the restaurant, we didn't have any wine so I can't comment on the wine list. The meals came with potato and vegatable, pasta was on the menu as a separate course and we thought it would be too much to have both. [It felt odd to have veal without pasta - but everything was tasty]. We started with mixed green salads. The salad had tasty fresh dark greens with a nice balsamic vinagrette and small, thin, wedges of firm riccotta cheese. MM MM good! Will definitely reutrn.

Much of it is written in italian, which makes ordering difficult. I know that restaurants love to do that, but it is annoyer. The wine list is entirely incomprehensible.
October 16, 2010|Arrival was simplified by|4|Arrival was simplified by free complimentary valet parking and we were seated immediately despite the crowd waiting. Sat in series of tables for 2 that were a little. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, despite appearing quite busy. Appropriate attention from bus staff. Table was a bit tight between the menu, substantial wine list, water, wine, food and neighbors ... Clay baked mozzarella was thick with flavor. Pasta with basil pesto mixed in with tomato based sauce was perfectly oily. Veal marsala with wild mushrooms was tender and thick with woody flavor. Cannolis for desert were sweet and not at all chalky. Liquid dessert was not oversweet and quite enjoyable. All in all, a wonderful experience.

I prefer salad after the entree and they fulfilled my request.Unfortunately, the food was not as expected based upon reviews on this site and others. We ordered the roasted fig appetizer and it was lukewarm, under seasoned and not memorable. We ordered from the specials (osso bucco & rib-eye steak), and both were again under seasoned and luke-warm. The worst was when the bill arrived, seeing that the specials were significantly more expensive ($34/39) than any of the other entrees on the menu ($15-27). Unfortunately, we failed to ask the cost of the specials when we ordered and the waitress did not advise of thier cost.

The staff were welcoming and completely unfazed by my entry. They were s completely accomadating. We ordered 4 appetizers because we couldn't decide. Each one was better than the next. The grilled vidalia onions with gorgonzola and greens was perfect, as was the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes. The baked smoked mozzarella in wonderful tomato sauce was amazing. We shared the lasagna, gnocci and seared tuna over truffle oil infused canneloni beans and argued over which was best. We decided that the gnocci was the better than any of us had ever tasted. We will head to Providence the next time we want to enjoy a really fantastic Italia

Our waiter seemed very overwhelmed, often forgetting that we were there. 15 minutes after we placed our order we were informed that the appetizer was not available. Another 10 minutes passed before he came back to take our replacement request. Our food was not good. Melanzane Rollatini, nice but the sauce was very salty. Rigatoni Cardinale was overloaded with pancetta, again way too salty. My lips were literally puckering. Filet special with risotto, risotto way too over cooked, with no flavor, medium rare steak was burnt & charred on the outside. Needless to say, we skipped dessert & still lost 2+ hours of our labor day weekend.

The seats by the window are very nice especially with the windows open. The filet special was cook perfectly and the calamari and Provola appetizers were out of this world. The service was great, Kyle made wonderful wine recommendations and we were not rushed at all. The warm golden raisin bread pudding and housemade tiramisu were a wonderful way to finish off the meal! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!
September 4, 2010|Cute restaurant, love the|4|Cute restaurant, love the valet parking! The food was tasty but not outstanding, and the portion sizes were just right for no leftovers. A good variety of specials was offered. Our Caesar salad was nicely done, romaine crunchy & the shaved parmesan slightly smoky and nutty, & not drenched in dressing. One in our party asked to substitute veggies for the carb that came with her meal, and her request was easily honored. My lamb chops (a special) were done medium when I had asked for med-rare, but they were flavorful nonetheless. The waitstaff did not clear all the empty glasses and bread plates with oil, so when our entrees came the table was quite crowded, which was off-putting. We shared raisin bread pudding for dessert, it was delicious.

Our server (Richard) even was diligent about food allergies at the table. The menu was extensive (and there were many wonderful specials), the prices were lower than I expected (reasonable for a nice meal) and the food was really extraordinary.

The food is still good, but it's no longer great. Such a shame.

It is at the far end of Atwell Street's restaurant row and does NOT offer summer outdoor dining, so it is not quite as bustling as some of the other open air spots. Try the warm Bruschetta con Scarola appetizer with rustic bread, escarole, pancetta and white beans - yum....

Also, the lights seemed to have flickered or dimmed briefly about every 5 min for a quick second...very strange. The service was too over the top at times. Bus Boys and the server kept stopping by about every five minutes, hovering over the table and our conversation and causing awkward moments where we kept having to tell them that we were still working on the appetizer plate, entrees, etc. They seemed to be rushing us at times, although it was a Saturday evening with later hours of operation for the restaurant.

My meal was mediocre at best too. The Caprese salad was weak. The olive oil over it had a bitter taste and if you are going to put basil on it...which makes it in my opinion...use whole leaves for real flavor...not basil shreds. I also had the Veal Saltimboca...the veal was tough and chewy...not tender by any stretch of the imagination. My wife had a pasta dish with sausage in it....bits of sausage I should say...otherwise the pasta and the sauce for that was good.

The dessert was good. My starter was great, a salad with a medley of onion and goat cheese. My entree was equally great, it was a swordfish specia with a lemon risotto. I thoroughly enjoyed mine, she did not so it was hard to give it a full 4 stars. The wine list was pretty good with a selection of italian wines.

May 29, 2010|Was looking for a restaurant|5|Was looking for a restaurant for a 6PM Saturday night last minute and booking through Open Table came up with Pane e Vino. What a gem. Everything was top notch. Reservation was for 6pm and they sat us right on time. I explained that we were going to the theater and the waiter made sure everything we ordered came out promptly. We had stuffed figs for an App. and veal and chicken for a main course and everything came out hot and delicious. The waiter was attentive without being intrusive. With a couple of glasses of wine, dinner and dessert and coffee with tip the whole thing was just $100.00. Well worth the price. We will be going back

We gave a courtesy call to Pan e Vino and they graciously held our reservation until we got there. The menu was excellent with something for everyone and the service was attentive and informative. The wine list was more than abundant and had a nice section specially listed as ""favorites"" for under $30, which allows you to try something new with out the risk of an overpriced dissapointment. We had an excellent evening and would go to Pan e Vino again. RAZ"

The service (getting food to table) was slow for a weeknight. They ran out of the special, so I didn't get to eat what I really wanted--which I'm sure affected my impression. Our server was great--very accomodating and helpful.

The calamari was burn't, some of the pieces were so small and over cooked it was not worth eating and the portion was small as were the other meals for the price. Alkso there was a 35min wait between appatizer and main course. probably won't go back not for $120!
May 7, 2010|The food was excellent. We|4|The food was excellent. We had three different entrees and were debating who had the best. Pork chops, halibut (special) and swordfish were all perfectly done. The spices, herbs and sauces were optimal additions.

This was a great choice of ours ans we will be returning soon!

But it is surely worth putting it on your list of places not to miss. I'm not the one to really ask about such things as ambience (although the place was charming), nor whether it is part of any given ""scene"" (as I am, by choice, not). But if you want to know about food, then this is a real find. the choices are totally varied, the preparation was very well done, and most of all, everyone thought their meals were delicious. the portions were substantial, but not glutonous, so you left full but not stuffed beyond capacity. There is something for everyone here, so go and enjoy a truly memorable meal."

Dined on April 24, 2010|This is becoming my go to|5|This is becoming my go to spot when I am in Providence. Again, the valet service was OUTSTANDING, dining room service was close to PERFECT, food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. From the moment we walked into a very crowded resturant and did not have to wait a minute because of our OPENTABLE reservation, I knew we were in for ANOTHER great night on the hill. Main meals today were sea scallops and filet mignon, both were done to PERFECTION and served piping hot. We started our night with with the meat and cheese plate...OUTSTANDING as always and ended it with a choc tortina (like a choc lava cake but about 1000 times better)served @ pistashio jelloto and a warm apple tart served @ vanilla jelloto. What a way to end a great dinner, THANKS to all.

We had enough food so we had room for dessert and we were not overly stuffed. I wish there were two choices for dessert. I do not like coffee and the dessert was taramazu, I ate it and it was good, but I would have prefered something else. We had a 5:00 reservation and we had plenty of time to eat and get to the 6:30 show at PPAC."

My pea rissotto which was also a special did not have any peas in it and tasted more like mushy white rice. Despite the previously stated issues, the swordfish was excellent and the restaurant presents a nice romantic setting for a date which can sometimes be hard to find in some of the bigger name resturants on Atwells Ave."

April 4, 2010|The menu offered a nice mix|5|The menu offered a nice mix of classic and more novel Italian fare, and the service was outstanding. We were there on Easter Sunday, late afternoon to early evening, and it wasn't crowded, which was nice. Pane e Vino is on famous Atwells Ave, but down toward one end, not in the middle of the busiest part, which you might like or not. Street noise was still a factor on a warm day with the front opened to the street. We had a nicely paced meal, everything was excellent, and they were very accommodating to our five-year-old, even digging out a cigar box full of crayons and an actual coloring book. Highly recommended.
April 4, 2010|My boyfriend and I visited|4|My boyfriend and I visited for Easter lunch. I had requested a table by the window and we were seated as requested. It was a beautiful day and it was lovely to be able to look outside the windows while dining. Excellent service. Loved the bread!! I had the swordfish and he had the lobster ravioli. Both were absolutely wonderful. The wine came a bit too late into our meal but thats my only criticism. We will come back in the summer when there's more of a scene out on the street. Not sure that you would enjoy this restaurant with small children but your older kids would be comfortable.
April 2, 2010|We had a very enjoyable and|4|We had a very enjoyable and relaxing dinner at Pane e Vino. All of the staff was friendly (without bothering us too frequently) and attentive to our needs. We went for the specials- the poached halibut with olive oil and cherry tomatoes was a little fishy but still very good. The only downside was sitting near the busing station in the back- too noisy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to smaller groups who are looking for fresh Italian food with a world class wine list.

The food was well above average and interesting. the service was discrete and helpful, especially for my wife who has allergies. Above all, we could talk together in peace and sufficient quiet in a really nice atmosphere. I would recommend it.
March 28, 2010|Phenomenal food and great|5|Phenomenal food and great service. I really enjoyed the fact that you could buy small plates of cheeses and cured meats. I took my mom for her birthday and it was absolutely excellent in our opinions (and we are both Italian). This place was great the only thing bad about it had really nothing to with the restaurant itself, it had to do with the customers. A group sat down behind our table and had a bunch of cell phones that kept ringing and beeping. One of the men at the table actually answered his phone twice, right at the table. Again, this is not pan e vino's fault, however I don't think it is outrageous for waitresses/waiters to tell customers that if they have a call they need to move it to the bar (or in my opinion outside).

March 13, 2010|25 minute wait, with reservation.|4|25 minute wait, with reservation. But this was on Federal Hill on a Sat night. Long narrow room, tastefully decorated. We are seated right next to the fireplace on the back wall. The excessive heat from the fireplace overpowered the ambience of the fire, but the waiter did turn it off after a couple of reminders. Excellent food, from a lightly breaded, perfected cooked Frito Misto to a perfectly grilled Veal Chop and interesting cookie plate, made up for the wait.

Richard, our server took great care of us,running us through the menu with great ease. EVERYTHING was great from the first course to desert, it could not have been better. Thanks for a great night.
March 13, 2010|Very nice experience. We arrived|4|Very nice experience. We arrived on time for an early Saturday night reservation and were taken to the back room for a table close to the fireplace. Service was prompt. The menu was extensive and enticing. One gem was the cheese and meat platter used as a communal appetizer. The calamari were a bit mushy, the only drawback to the entire meal. All four entrees were deemed excellent. One was a nightly special of poached red snapper, which was light and delicious. Side vegetables were fresh and crisp, but not particularly exciting. Breads (we asked for and received a second helping) were chewey and tasty and the wine was generously served. All in all a fine experience.
March 13, 2010|Average - nothing special.|3|Average - nothing special. Sallimi and formaggio appetizer was unique but Mortadella was unavailable. Saltimbocca was a disapointment! Great service but only mediocre quality.

The food was well worth it. We both had the special which was short ribs. The meat was cooked perfectly. Very flavorful and tender. Excellent wine selection and a knowledgable staff to recommend the perfect wine to compliment the ribs. Would definitely recommend going there. Avoid the busy times to avoid any wait.

February 14, 2010|Valentine's Day dinner was|4|Valentine's Day dinner was our fourth or fifth visit to Pane e Vino, which has become our favorite destination on the Hill. We are attracted by the quiet ambiance, excellent (and fairly priced) wine list, and friendly service. The food, alas, is a little less reliable. I've never had an appetizer that was less than excellent, and I love the bread pudding, but the main courses can sometimes be a bit dissapointing: this time it was the bolognese, which seemingly was based entirely on veal, and was rather bland. If only the chef were more consistent with his main courses, I'd rate Pane e Vino 5 stars!

However, when we were returned our food in take-away boxes, one of them seemed like it was missing half the food. Which, by the way, prices are a little on the steep end.

If your looking for a nice comfortable, cozy night out with your significant other, then its a great choice. Extensive wine selection is a plus. The roasted pear salad was light and yet very flavorful. Calamari was very well done. Lobster ravioli and the stuffed pork chop were both very good. Dessert was bread pudding which is large enough for two and was spectacular. Overall, very good food, excellent staff and well worth the trip.

Tables are too close together making a private conversation impossible. Sat us near a young child on our Valentine's night out...

We all opted to order from the prix fixe menu sampling the Bruschetta con Scarola (so different and delicious), Melanzane al Forno (outstanding), Spiedini di Manzo (perfectly cooked) and of course the Tiramisu (yum). Also, the white grape martini was perfectly mixed. The entire staff was very attentive and accommodated our every request. This is definitely a place to return to again and again.

December 23, 2009|After hearing rave reviews|3|After hearing rave reviews about this restaurant this was a tad bit disappointing. Had the La Vigilia (7 fishes pre Christmas celebration)and found the first course to be quite good,but snail salad had an odd flavor to it. Vegetables were hard and tasteless. Codfish was nothing out of the ordinary, stuffed shrimp (2) were good. Clams and pasta were fresh but quite bland. (I was surprised at this since it is so simple to make a good one). So all in all for the 7 fishes, my expectations were admittedly high, but I would not recommend it to anyone. Sorry guys, because I do like your regular menu and thought this would be as special or better. Sadly it wasn't!

What I was very surprised at was the fact that I paid $34.00 for 2 martinis, and that didn't include the $6.00 tip I left! Way too expensive for my taste.

Whether it's worth the price or not, I'm not quite sure. I ate scallops which were delicious, but ended up switching with my father for his pasta because he found the sausage to be overcooked. The service was just fine, our waiter was personable and knew the menu very well. Overall it was okay, and unless you're really curious, I'd probably skip it.

November 18, 2009|The antipasti were outstanding|3|The antipasti were outstanding - especially the cheeses. And we liked both pasta dishes a great deal. Obviously they have a good chef in the kitchen. Service was very hit and miss, though. For example, our server was very knowledgeable on the food selections, but felt it necessary to correct my Italian pronunciation, let our wine and water glasses stay empty too long, and was generally not as attentive as one would like given the prices. And when the kitchen staff delivered the antipasti after an inordinate amount of time, he joked about how he deserved half of it because he worked so hard pulling it together - what's that about?

The wine list is not so large that it is unmanageable and the selection of wines is actually quite decent as long as you prefer Italian vintages.

October 17, 2009|We enjoyed another fine evening|5|We enjoyed another fine evening at Pan e Vino! Our menu choices - the mushroom ravioli, veal scallopini and gnocchi - were all delicious. The atmosphere is nice, with the exception of the TV in the back room. Valet parking is a breeze. The service was excellent and we highly recommend Pan e Vino!
October 16, 2009|We reserved through open table|5|"We reserved through open table and they gave us a lovely table near the fireplace, very cozy. While this is not haute cuisine ambitious, I have to say that food was very very good traditional ""northern Italian"", and the prices were quite fair for the high quality. Our waitress was sweet and attentive, and so was the rest of the staff. I checked ""notable wine list"" -- really good selection from piemonte and EXCELLENT pricing. Really nice place, highly recommended."

October 10, 2009|The food and service was outstandin|4|The food and service was outstanding. The waitress and chef were very helpful when my daughter wanted to order something not on the menu. The butternut ravioli was delicious and my dining partners loved the veal marsala. We were seated in the back room which was fine but the ambiance was lacking back there.
October 4, 2009|I was expecting a terrific|3|I was expecting a terrific meal based on reviews, but we were underwhelmed. Food mediocre, presentation similar to chain restaurant. Lots of bright red tomato sauce on everything. Menu missing signature beef dish and had no beef substitute. One entree incorrect but because it was a pasta we accepted it so the meal could continue... Restaurant knew it was a birthday meal and yet I had to ask for a candle... Odd that they didn't take better care of us - could have sent us home with correct pasta or adjusted price or at least remembered b'day. We're Philadelphians and are in RI most fall weekends. Providence has tons of great places so we won't be going back to this one. Too bad because the physical space was very attractive.
October 4, 2009|I have always loved the food|5|I have always loved the food at Pane y Vino!!! It reminds me of my Italian grand mother's home cooking
October 2, 2009|We have been to Pane a number|4|We have been to Pane a number of times including a birthday prat for my wife earlier this year with about 20 people. Food and service are very dependable. My 16 oz. breaded veal chop was slightly burnt on the edges but inside portions were nicely cooked. Pasta was al dente - perfect. We tried an antipasto platter with cured meats and cheeses that was very good. My wife enjoyed a halibut dish and my mother in law had the fixed price menu with a pork entree. A recommended bottle of white wine was excellent. Pane is as good a restaurant as you will find on the hill.
October 1, 2009|Unfortunately, my experience|2|Unfortunately, my experience was not great. I was there with a friend celebrating our birthdays. We both ordered the special Halibut that night. My dish came out in a soup broth and very bland, it was covered in cherry tomotoes that lent to even more liquid. My friend ordered hers wood grilled. Her fish came out very dry. Plus, the waiter said the dishes were 22.00 and we were charged 28.00. I ordered a house salad for 8.00, all I got was greens. I will not go back.

The waiter was very nice and answered any questions we had. His name was Kyle. The food we ordered came out hot and we were not rushed to eat like in some other restaurants. My wife & I would recommend Pane e Vino to anyone looking for good Italian food with a nice atmosphere.
September 21, 2009|We had an excellent dinner|4|We had an excellent dinner for 6 - everyone loved their meals. Our only discomfort was the browning out of Ithe lighting as the air conditioning kicked on. We'll definitely be back - especially after air conditioning season. The golden raisin bread pudding is amazing - a surprising and delectable comfort dessert.

We shared a small chocolate mousse cake with vanilla gelato...also excellent! Mostly what we were impressed with was our waiter Chris. He was very pleasant and happy to help us make a good selection by answering all our questions. By far he has to be one of the best (if not THE Best) waiters we have ever had!!!
September 9, 2009|Having returned numerous times|4|"Having returned numerous times to several of the many Italian restaurants on ""Da Hill"" in Providence I decided to try a different one. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food at Pane e Vino - the chef does excellent work. In both my case and my dinner partner's case they modified an item on the menu to meet our desires. The service was very good, and the wine list is relatively long. It's a little pricier than many of the other restaurants in the neighborhood. But if you have the dough, it's worth it."
September 8, 2009|Excellent wine list with good|4|Excellent wine list with good value. Bread is outstanding, but had to ask for butter. Pastas are superb, especially the bucatini alla amatriciana. Valet parking makes this a convenient and enjoyable dining experience.

We will be sorry when he graduates and we will no longer have an excuse to come to Providence and visit the restaurant. We lived in Italy for 4 1/2 years and this is one of our favorite Italian restaurants ever.

August 30, 2009|Joseph Dequattro has created|5|Joseph Dequattro has created an absolute gem in the heart of historic Federal Hill in Providence, RI. We dined there Sunday evening and had, as usual, an excellent meal with great service. What struck me as extrodinary was the fact that all the tables were full and there seemed to be no confusion for the wait staff and the noise level was very good...everyone seemed to be having a good time without being boisturous....probably to busy enjoying the food and drink. Frank Giglio
August 23, 2009|We have dined at Pane e Vino|3|We have dined at Pane e Vino numerous times but unfortunately this visit did not meet our expectations. Food was good, but not as good as we remember. The cannelloni's we had for dessert tasted like they just came out of the freezer. Service was fair, again not as good as we remember. We are just assuming it was an off night ( it was a quiet Sunday evening) and will visit them again another time. Hopefully it will be a better experience.

I would like to see them do something interesting with Seitan or TVP on a weekly basis...vegetarian special of the week. We would dine there a lot more often if they did.

July 18, 2009|I went to Pane e Vino after|3|"I went to Pane e Vino after receiving rave reviews from my boss, so I had high expectations. My experience wasn't as great as I had hoped. Although the bread was delicious, it was served with plain olive oil. Perhaps a little roasted garlic or spices could ""kick it up a notch"". We ordered a caprese salad for the table of 4. What we got amounted to about 3 bites per person. Could you spare the tomato & cheese? I ordered a veal dish which arrived cold. After sending it back, the veal and sauce were hot enough, but the risotto underneath was still cold. With so many restaurants to choose from, I was not impressed and don't think I will return."
July 18, 2009|Martini list was fun. Antipasto|4|Martini list was fun. Antipasto was very good. Scallops, though a little fishy-smelling, tasted wonderful, as did the risotto. Veal with lemon had a very strong lemon taste. Luckily my dining companion liked that and said he would order it again. Good portions. Nice location on Federal Hill in Providence.

It was so nice to see a young lady very nicely dressed as the hostess. Our server, also a young lady, was very attentive and a nice conversationalist while not intrusive. She was knowledgeable of the wines and helped us make very nice choices. The appetizers were outstanding and served very quickly. The main courses were very good. My companion rated her Osso buco as excellent while my halibut was delicious but slightly over cooked. The single serving of tiramiso was outstanding and more than the two of us could eat. The waitress was exceptional but the bus boys need to trained on when a diner is finished.

March 28, 2009|Overall a very good experience.|4|Overall a very good experience. Only complaint we had was the 40 minute wait despite the fact that we had made a reservation. It was a very busy night for the restaurant, but we would have probably appreciated being told approximately how long the wait might be so we could at least get a drink or even an appetizer at the bar. We didn't eat our main course until 9:45 and had an 8pm reservation. Other than that, the service was very, very good. Waiter was very knowledgeable. Absolutely no complaints about the food. Everything was fresh and delicious, which probably explains the long wait. Very extensive Italian wine list, as well.

The slow cooked beef, on the other hand was great. More troubling was the fact that the waiter quoted us one price ($24) but then charged us $29. The table we had was wonderful, and the service was outstanding, but the meal was overpriced. We could have had the same meal in the North End for less.

We have been several tiimes, and we will certainly return again. Well worth the trip (we are from Massachusetts).
March 14, 2009|Food and wine were excellent.|4|Food and wine were excellent. We have yet to have a bad meal having eaten here on several occasions. The only disappoint was they were unable to honor our request for a table by the windows.

February 8, 2009|We were a little disappointed|3|We were a little disappointed in the food, actually. Compared to our meals at Cassarino's, which were outstanding, the entrees were ho-hum. My Caesar salad was better than average, but the croutons were skimpy. The seared scallops were delicious, but the polenta was bland and didn't compliment the meal. My husband's frutta de mere was obviously made from frozen seafood; we are both ex-chefs and can tell the difference. Both of our sons were disappointed; one had the breaded veal and the other had gnocci (he tries it everywhere.) The fresh grated cheese, the olive oil, and the bread were delicious. I did find the decor attractive; nice colors and lighting. Our table on the porch was very nice for intimate dining.
February 7, 2009|Our server Ken was fantastic-all|5|Our server Ken was fantastic-all around, the food was excellent - only thing was the portions were a wee smaller than expected or perhaps hoped, as the food was so good, but as price was just right, that could be the equalizer. The mushroom ravioli with truffle cream were outta sight. Valets were sweethearts, everything was quick, but not rushed, was comfortable. My date had ordered the sage proscuitto veal, but didn't get the correct kind of veal. He said it was very good at any rate, though saucy. The smoked mozzerella was quite good and dessert was refreshing.

As there were not many diners, we were surprised at the lenght of time it took for our drink order to be taken. We were never asked if we would like a refill on our wine. At the end of our meal we ordered after dinner drinks. The waiter spilled a drink at our table on the shirt and jacket of our friend. He made light of the accident--not offering apology or compensation for the cleaning. We were very surprised. That said, we will go back since the food was so good.
January 22, 2009|Pane e Vino continues to be|5|Pane e Vino continues to be one of our favorite places. Food, service and value remain consistantly good. We are senior citizens. We dine out often so we appreciate the portion and fixxed price of the Tratoria menus. The wine list is excellent. Anytime we can dine quietly with excellent food and drink for $100 is a plus for us. This week we brought a friend to celebrate her 75th birthday.
January 17, 2009|This is probably our favorite|5|This is probably our favorite Italian restaurant in Providence ( which says much since there are many, many ). Always excellent service and food! A bit tight in the bar area when many are waiting for tables on a busy weekend night, but definitely well worth the crowded wait. The Italian wine list is very special and the well inform staff can lead those unfamiliar with this region through the selections.
January 17, 2009|The food was good, not great,|2|The food was good, not great, but OK. I think the waiter could have asked if we wanted to start with a soup or salad, or maybe an appetizer. The meal, very pricy, was the piecs of meat or chicken on a small bed or rice, no vegetable, no side, no salad. The chicken breast I had came with a scoop of rice for $23, was OK in taste, but it needed a vegetable and was extremely high priced. The steak my husband had was 8 ounces, with a small scoop of rice and two twigs of asparagus,for $34, no side, no salad. It may be just as well we didnt choose to buy a salad or a side dish, or I would have had to mortgage the house to eat there. We couldnt afford dessert. Would I go again? Only if I hit the lottery to pay for it. We got our coffee at DD.
January 2, 2009|There are many great restaurants|5|There are many great restaurants on Atwells, but Pane e Vino is my favorite - always great food and great service. It is further up Atwells than the others, so the availability of parking is better. They have an extensive menu and the chef's specials are an excellent mix of meat, fowl and fish.

Water and bread arrive within a few minutes but after 15 minutes we had to ask for a waiter, a few minutes later he arrived apologizing for the wait, he said he didn't know we were his table.The service and food that followed was good.

The food was excellent, the service extremely good and the atmosphere classic Italian relaxed.... a little crowded and a little noisy - but all in a good way. Not dark and romantic, but laid-back with white linen tablecloths. Oh, and an excellent wine list and the calamari appetizer was tops.

December 8, 2008|This was our second visit|5|This was our second visit to Pane e Vino and it was a friend's birthday. It was even better the second time than the first. It was also on a Monday night when their wine list is 50% off and that makes for a much more fun time! This is one of the best italian restaurants in the Federal Hill area as everything we had was fabulous. The service was also terrific with a friendly and knowledgeable waitress that had both great food and wine suggestions. And the Grana Padano cheese they serve was incredible! All in all, a wonderful night of celebration that was made even more special by the food and service.

Proceeded to our table and we could not have enjoyed our dinners more, all greatly enhanced by our waiter, Dennis, and his assistant, Jose. We are already looking forward to our next visit.

November 1, 2008|The food was great, as good|4|The food was great, as good as we've had in Providence. Our only problem was the service.Our server and others who attended us were friendly, but service was very slow. We saw two other tables in the front room (street view) who came after us, one a larger party, have their orders taken and they were served before us. We had to remind the server that we were waiting, and then the food came. Perhaps she was distracted by her chatting with a couple at a nearby table that she seemed to know quite well. We'd come again, but we would hope for more attendant servers.
October 28, 2008|Was acceptable for what we|3|Was acceptable for what we paid. However, we expected, based on the restaurant's website, a way more upscale restaurant with interesting and unique dishes. That turned out to be false.

We had never been to Pan e Vino so we made a reservation. The valet was very quick and pleasant. Dennis was our server. We were served the wrong type of water by a different person, I received the wrong appetizer and waited 90 minutes to receive our entrees. With no appology given. While couples and larger parties around us were sat after us and received their meals before us. After we finaly received our meals, Dennis never came back to see is we needed anything. And we had to flag him down to ask for another glass of wine. I was so angry by this aweful service that we will NEVER dine here again, and we will let others know.

August 30, 2008|Our experience at Pane e Vino|2|Our experience at Pane e Vino was a disappointment. While the food is very good, they ignored the comments I made in making our reservation on Open Table, so my friend did not get the surprise birthday cake I requested for her. The receptionist and the waiter were unaware that this was a special occasion even though this was mentioned in the online reservation and they me called a day before to confirm it. Even with the reservation, we had a half hour wait for our table And instead of bringing the decaf expressos we ordered, they brought caffinated cappucinos, probably someone else's order. No valet was available when we arrived so we wound up parking the car ourselves. So, all in all, a less than stellar experience.
August 24, 2008|We went on a Sunday evening|4|We went on a Sunday evening with a small group and were very pleased. The service was attentive and friendly and the food plentiful and tasty. Some ordered a la carte and others from the pre fixe menu and both options were satisfying. Definitely in the rotation for future visits to Federal Hill.

Sea bass $29 with 2 tiny potato croquettes and a little broccoli??? It was very good but nothing unusual. And the server NEVER tells the price with the elaborate description.

This time, we opted for the restaurant week special menu and were not as impressed with the main courses. Both appetizers and the fruit dessert were good. The wine was excellent both times. Servers were good, and some were very attentive - it felt like a slower night but perhaps that was because were were in the very back room with only 2 other tables occupied.
July 10, 2008|The food was great. One of|4|The food was great. One of the best caesar salads I have ever encountered. I had a pasta Fra Dia Volo with seafood that was excellent (although a bit heavily sauced). My wife's rigatoni with fennel sausage was to die for. Our friends had a great veal marsala and rigatoni with several kinds of meat, also both excellent. Great bottle of Rosso di Montalcino. The only complaint was that the service was initially a little slow. Once our orders were taken, everything was very well paced. This would be a great romantic spot; the dining room is small and intimate. One of the jewels of Federal Hill!

July 6, 2008|The food seemed to be un inspired.|2|The food seemed to be un inspired. I thought that the food was under seasoned and bland. The brocoli rabe and sausage with orricette was flavorless and the hanger steak was too small of a portion. My wife had some chicken dish and although tender she said it had no taste. There didn't seem to be anyone in charge. The kitchen workers were loud and unprofessional. The waitress seemed bothered to be there. Of all the places in this mostly empty restaurant they seated us right outside of the kitchen. I hate to give negative feedback but maybe some good can come out of this review. Mike Madonick
June 28, 2008|The 3 of us enjoyed it immensely|5|The 3 of us enjoyed it immensely and will definitely return. The only reason I put moderate for noise is when we first arrived, the party at the next table was using a cell phone and talking rather loudly, but, thank heavens, they were near the end of their meal and left soon after. I would have said something to management and had our table changed had they not left but it all worked out.

We were more than impressed. The service was wonderful, the atmosphere delightful and our server made us feel like we were the only 2 people in the restaurant (which, by far, we were not.) We would recommend this restaurant to all of our friends and anyone traveling to Providence for business or pleasure. Since going out to dinner has become quite a luxury for us, having an enjoyable experience, coupled with great cuisine, made spending the extra money well worth it! Thank you for such a lovely evening.

Really worth checking out if one has not been yet. One minor issue...a kitchen staffer kept one of our party locked out of the one-person men's room for way too long while making a lengthy cell phone call. Take the cell calls outside, guys!

It had been just ""OK"" However we had recieved a few gift cards over the past year and needed a place in Providence to meet our son and new fianace. We decided that since dinner would be our treat we would go to return with our gift cards. We were pleasantly surprised. Our waiter, Dennis was great. Attentive but not overly so. The food was excellent. Loved the complimentary olives and bread. We had the spinach salad that I thought might be to heavy but was light and crisp. Three of us had the veal chop. again excellent. One of us had the gnocchl and said it was the best she ever had. They also have great speccials from 5-7 for $19.95. Perfect for a celebration"

I think they take their customers for granted; waitress spilled a bottle of wine on my daughter and only offered another glass.

May 25, 2008|They were a little backed|3|They were a little backed up on the reservations, so we had to wait for about 30 minutes...that was okay, but the waiting area was really insufficient as there was a large crowd waiting. Also the first hostess was no where to be found for quite some time to be able to assure people that they were doing all they could, but then another woman came out and seemed to have a handle on things. Not a big deal, except that there were several unhappy people in the waiting area and one of them was completely obnoxious and was using foul language in the area and to the hostess--I dont blame the restaurant for this, but it was hard to forget about it as my kids were wiht me...
May 24, 2008|Our table was not ready when|4|Our table was not ready when we arrived on time for our reservation. At first they were not that accommodating. But after 45 minute wait, they were very pleasant and seated us with a free appetizer and great service. All dishes were very good, we had a party of 10 and everyone loved their meal. I would definitely go back again!

Service was ok, weren't treated very well when we were seated. Hostess was very nice when we first walked in, greeted us by name, and told us our table would be ready shortly. In a few minutes, we were told our table was ready and taken there by a host, who sat us, tossed a drink special menu on the table muttered something and walked off. Our waitress arrived shortly, took our drink order, gave us the specials and disappeared. She came back in a few minutes, took our order, sans drinks. a while passed before our salads showed up with our drinks. would like to have had our drinks first. The rest of the night went well.
May 17, 2008|I was very disappointed with|2|I was very disappointed with our meal. All entrees were mediocre, at best. No one in our group finished his/her meal which is unusual for us - a group of food lovers. The red sauce lacked flavor and vibrance; it was totally missing that burst of brightness that is present in fresh tomatoes. Even traditional (easy) Italian foods/preparations were disappointing. The risotto was glue-y, the food poorly seasoned and poorly presented on the plate. The menu was unimaginative and wasn't seasonal- there are so many great spring foods/flavors! My husband commented that when I make those dishes at home, they are way better. We went there for a special occasion and I felt really bad that the experience wasn't better. I should have cooked at home.
May 17, 2008|On a recent evening in May,|5|On a recent evening in May, our group of four dined at Pane e Vino. As the weather was warm with a light breeze, we were delighted to be seated by an open window looking out at the charming Federal Hill night life. This wonderful Italian restaurant is our absolute favorite! The food is consistently delicious and the wait staff friendly and efficient. We began our dinner by sharing an excellent Bruchetta and Ensalada Caprese. Our individual orders of seafood, veal, and pasta followed and throughout the meal we enjoyed wine and cocktails. To complete our feast, we shared an assortment of Italian cookies and fruit. Everything we were served was excellent! We are pleased to highly recommend this wonderful and intimate restaurant.

May 1, 2008|I had heard raves about the|3|I had heard raves about the restaurant, but we found the food underwhelming. The lobster and shrimp in arrabiata sauce was way too oily, which ruined the flavor, and the mussels in spicy tomato broth were gritty and the sauce lacked depth of flavor. The veal marsala had good flavor but was also greasy. The best dish was the rigatoni with meatballs, sausage and ricotta. Heavy but yummy. This is an okay red sauce Italian place, but there were too few selections in that category. This place would probably excel at chicken parm, but it's trying to be more than it is. After just coming back from Chicago two weeks ago and being blown away by three restaurants that were comparable in price and size, this one paled in comparison.

But I would not go back, based on my experience. I ordered a ceasar salad, which had way too much dressing. Then a grilled shrimp dish with risotto. The shrimp itself was excellent, but no amount of salt could bring out any flavor in the risotto. For dessert, I ordered flan, which is my favorite dessert. I was very disappointed. It was not baked with a caramel sauce, but rather a too sweet, and too thick (maybe bottled?) caramel sauce was drizzled on the side. It did not taste the way it does when the flan is baked with it. Why would you even bother serving it if you're not going to do it right?

I ordered the Crustaceo Fra Diavolo and requested NO lobster (allergic) and not spicey. well..you guessed it...it was spicey and WITH lobster. I should have said something when I noticed this but I did not want my guests to have to wait while my correct meal was prepared. The waitress asked me if she should wrap it to go when clearing the table and it was a shame that it had to be thrown out, but it had to be! but everything else was wondeful! Thank you!

March 29, 2008|We had reservations for 9pm|2|"We had reservations for 9pm and arrived early (8:15) We did not mind waiting at the bar until our time, but were annoyed when our table was finally called at 9:20. The service was disappointing, and we felt as if we were doing our waiter a ""favor"" by being there. We were seated next to a large party (25+) and thus could not enjoy our romantic night out as we had anticipated."
March 29, 2008|Pane e Vino is a staple of|5|Pane e Vino is a staple of Providence dining on Federal Hill & rightfully so. Incredible fresh ingredients served in traditional southern italian dishes. Not to mention the best italian wine list in New England & great service!
March 28, 2008|Would have scored better it|2|Would have scored better it wasn't for the fact that it took our server 20 minutes to bring us our check after our desert was finished. He was more interested in a bigger party than our table. I guess he figured that he would be getting a bigger tip from then my wife and me. Before then my wife and I wasn't interested in trying other restaurants in Federal Hill. That all change with that one experience.
March 23, 2008|This is one of our favorite|4|This is one of our favorite Providence restaurants. Very consistent - always excellent food and service, quiet, accommodating. They have a fabulous wine list and a good assortment of Italian wines by the glass. Some of the Federal Hill restaurants are too hip and trendy for us - we just like fine food well-prepared and presented without lots of distracting bells and whistles. We'll be back again soon.
March 23, 2008|It was the one of the best|5|"It was the one of the best places I have ever been to. All I can say was that it was ""JUST PERFECT!"" My family and I have not stopped talking about it with all of our friends. The service in Pane e Vino was superb! The food was unbelievable! There is nothing back that I can say but Thank you, Pane e Vino for making it even a more special day for my Mother's birthday. We are trying to plan another night to bring friends with us and go back."
March 23, 2008|The food is always prepared|5|The food is always prepared just right. Presentation is appealing, but what brings me back to this restaurant is the staff. Customer service of any kind is very important to me and their staff is exceptional. Thank you for getting me out of the kitchen on a holiday and having no regrets! Gail Gauvin
