February 20, 2016|Date Night Dinner|4|We enjoyed the chopped salad, dates with blue cheese, olives, shrimp sliders, and venison with risotto on a busy Saturday. The dishes were fresh, flavorful, and creative. Service was very friendly! We enjoyed a relaxing date night!
February 20, 2016|Go and Enjoy|4|I will go there again with friends. Sitting at the bar !

We definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, as it doesn't have the same old world feel that most of the Federal Hill area restaurants do. Service was also great. The paella was a little underwhelming, but both of us have been to Spain and probably had high expectations- everything else was what we had hoped.
February 14, 2016|Perfect Valentine|4|"We dined at Bocado in Providence with another couple for Valentine's Day. Eschewing the ""Experience for four"", we selected several rounds of tapas and had dessert. We were able to share as desired or not (one vegetarian and one who can't eat fish/seafood were in the group). Stand-outs among the tapas we ordered: the Manchego cheese, the almendras (almonds), the limo embuchado, the tortilla espa√±ola, and the hamburguesas de gambas (shrimp hamburgers). Our server, John, was very attentive and professional without being pushy or too informal."

February 12, 2016|Delish!|5|I have already recommended Bocado to several of my friends. The food was excellent, and the paella was out of this world! The tapas portions are perfect, and the paella is more than enough with leftovers to take home. Even the flan and churros were amazing. I honestly cannot wait for my next visit.
February 6, 2016|Very Nice Place|5|"We were very pleased with our meal and will be back. Highly recommended for a nice place to have a great meal. Go with ""the experience"", it allows you to diversify and have a blast!"

January 29, 2016|Fantastic Food|5|"three of us went out for dinner as a going away celebration. Every dish was phenomenal. Usually at restaurants I can say ""the food was good"" but rarely can I say it was amazing. We went around 7pm on a Friday night and it was pretty busy but not too loud or crowded."

January 21, 2016|Not a great experience!|3|While the waiter was nice, they were simply understaffed. Also, they brought the wrong orders to us, but we waited so long we ate it. Hopefully this was a one off experience!
January 16, 2016|Definately didn't disappoint!|4|This was my second time going to Bocado, this time was no different from the first. DELICIOUS food...hubby and I left stuffed once again. For it to be a small plate menu the variety to pick from is huge and you do get decent sizes to share. The drinks in my opinion could be a little bigger for the price, but they don't skimp on the alcohol. I would absolutely recommend Bocado to a friend. Perfect for date night or girls night out.
January 16, 2016|A Taste Of Spain|4|The food and service are both outstanding. The restaurant was packed. However the waitstaff keept us very happy. Always comming by our table with more food and drinks. Kudos to the entire staff.
January 16, 2016|Don't miss out on this!|5|This was my second visit, and even better than the first visit (which was awesome). Dean is an excellent waiter, was lucky enough to catch him both times. Looking forward to our next visit!

January 15, 2016|Tapas Convert|4|The food at Bocado was really good. I have not been a big fan of Tapas, but this was a new experience. The chicken croquettes were outstanding and the Seafood Paella was excellent! We loved the warehouse atmosphere and will definitely come back with friends.
January 11, 2016|Good tapas but service was lacking|3|I was seated in the front of the restaurant far from the kitchen. The waiter had many tables scattered in the restaurant and gave most attention to those near the kitchen where he passed by many times. As I was at his furthest table, also hidden by a partition, he rarely came to check on me and when I asked him to refill my Pepsi, he forgot about it. I had to ask the manager to get it. He also forgot to bring our appetizer to the table and when I reminded him, it eventually came, but only after we finished all our tapas.
January 9, 2016|Excellent, excellent, excellent.|5|What else can I say? The food was excellent. The wine was excellent. The service was excellent. Our waitress, Jasmine, was efficient, helpful and friendly. I would recommend Bacado highly. Definitely will return on a regular basis.
January 9, 2016|Bocados is great|5|The food is awesome well prepared and everything is very good quality. We love the Octopus appetizer
January 9, 2016|Best Tapas|5|We have been before and it's always Great food, service and prices. I would recommend to friends, families, and groups. Always a good time
January 3, 2016|Great wine, drinks, and service.|4|2nd time here both times did the Bocado Experience. Once with 2 then with 4 people. Wine knowledge was impressive. Mixed drinks were very good. The Octopus was the best tapa we tried. I would do without the sliders, the bread with them was disappointing. Pheasant sausage yummy. Ambiance was in need of improvement for comfort purposes. The chairs sat unevenly on the floor and the low backs were uncomfortable. Lighting was a bit bright for the setting. We will still go back just won't sit in those chairs! Bartender was awesome as was all the staff.
January 2, 2016|Never boring|5|We have eaten at Bocado 4 times and each experience is better than the last. We are never disappointed. You choose many small plates so you get a variety of perfectly prepared food brought out in waves. Just enough to keep you busy. We have had salmon,duck, cheeses, paella to mention a few, all at the same meal.
January 1, 2016|Great Space and Staff, Food was Mediocre|3|Given the great reviews of Bocado online, I was expecting more from this place. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the ambiance has a relaxed, modern feel, so my hopes were certainly not dashed at the door. I thought the chalkboard art was a cool addition to the space and the bar area was well-kept and seemingly well-stocked. However, when I go to a tapas restaurant, I really expect a great Sangria, which was definitely not the case here. We ordered the house special blend sangria, and it was lacking that fruity essence a great Sangria usually has; it really just tasted like wine with sugar in it. For dinner, we ordered the cider braised pork ribs, pollo a la plancha, bacon wrapped scallops, fried calamari, and the mozzarella rice balls. I'll start by saying that the mozz rice balls and bacon wrapped scallops were delicious - you can't go wrong with bacon or fried mozzarella. In my opinion though, they could improve on the other 3 dishes. The ribs were tender, but could really use a boost in the flavor department. The chicken in the pollo a la plancha was decent but the potato salad was not seasoned well - couldn't put my finger on why I didn't like it (maybe I just don't like Russian Potato Salad). The fried calamari was lightly battered and the perfect thickness, but the sauce was watery and not very flavorful (so close!). With tip, this ran us up to a $75 tab, which I can say I've certainly paid less than for far better tapas (in Boston, nonetheless). Overall, I'd give it a B-.
December 28, 2015|Great for a girls' night|4|The food and sangria were wonderful. The service was great. The chairs were a unusual with low backs and not the most comfortable.
December 20, 2015|The food was top-notch, as well as the service.|4|The food was top-notch, as well as the service. It was my first time there and our waitress was very easy-going and explained the whole protocol for ordering. My only complaint would be that my waitress went in detail to go over the wine list with me and then brought me a drink that I did not order--the drink was still great, but I would have liked to try what I had asked for. Other than that, the night was a great experience, and reasonably priced for the amount of food we ordered (we did the Bocado Experience--- I HIGHLY recommend it, especially if you're a foodie and love new tastes).
December 18, 2015|I have been to all 3 locations so far. I...|4|I have been to all 3 locations so far. It is always a pleasure to dine at Bocado. However, I have to say that the Worcester location is the best in all aspects. This is not to say that this location is bad at all :-). It has its own character that I feel is from its clientele thus the different experience that was still good.
December 5, 2015|A Spanish Experience|5|We had a great experience at Bocado! We ordered the dinner for two special which included 2 small appetizers, 4 tapas, a main course and desert. It was more than enough food, we even had a little left over. (taking into consideration that we are 2 small people) I'm not as familiar with Spanish wines, so the large list gave us the opportunity to explore new wines. We started with a wine flight that gave us a good introduction to Spanish wine. Service was excellent as well.

Even though we had reservations, we waited almost an hour to be seated. Then our meal lasted 3 hours when we could have been out of there in 2.

November 14, 2015|LACKS AUTHENTICITY|1|Unfortunately (for the restaurant) my bar is set high. Found the food to be acceptable but not authentic. Paella was probably the worse I've had in terms of taste and presentation. It seemed like they made a batch of the rice and, according to which of the 4 options of paella one chooses, they add the toppings, which seemed to have been sitting around. No taste whatsoever, the chicken was merely boiled, squid very blah, etc. And lastly, the sangria was not your usual pleasant sangria. It seemed to have had other types of liquor that was unrelated.
Dined on November 1, 2015|Great Find|5|Bocato was a great find. The food was very different and outstanding, as was the service and the ambience.
October 24, 2015|The staff was amazing! The food was amazing!|5|The ambiance was perfect ‚Äì you get to see a mixed crowd from young couple to older couples. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The fried goat cheese with honey is to die for. Service was perfect, staff was very knowledgeable of their wines.
October 24, 2015|Outstanding|5|Wonderful ambience. Food and service were excellent. We enjoyed the special tapas: patatas bravas with amazing sauces. Ribs and rabbit and tuna all excellent. Not a single miss. The fried avocado and shrimp salad was a great surprise that would make a nice lunch. We enjoyed our wine flights and an additional bottle of red. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful.

October 17, 2015|Great Place, Bad Waiter--Result Not So Great Meal|3|"The scene at the Providence branch of Bocado is great and the food is tasty. We would have had a wonderful time but the waiter did not handle our order properly. We were a group of 8, and ordered the ""Bocado experience"" for 8. This requires the selection of tapas and other items which are then served family style in a quantity appropriate for 8, along with salad for 8 and desert for 8 (that night, apple cobbler). Our waiter took the order, then put it in not as the experience for 8, but as individual orders of our selected items just for one. The plates came out and there wasn't enough for all of us to even get one bite. For the same reason we never received salad at all, and when desert arrived instead of cobbler for 8 it was churros for 2. When we asked what was going on, instead of admitting a mistake and getting us on track, the waiter told us that he did us a favor--he saved us money by ordering less than we had ordered or wanted, and would give us a couple of extra plates to make it up. Fighting with the waiter is never a good time, and we wanted to enjoy our meal, so we went with the flow, but the one or two extra items were nowhere near the amount or type of food we wanted. I hosted and a couple of my guests told me later that to be polite to others they simply stopped eating so there would be food for others to eat. My special night for my friends turned into an embarrassment. Go, check it out, eat the tasty food, and be prepared to fight for service."

October 17, 2015|A Favorite, Great for Conversation with Friends|4|This visit was the second time we have chosen Bocado to dine with friends. The food is superb but if you do not like one dish there are several others to choose from. Sharing the plates of small bites encourages conversation and the pace of the meal is excellent for a relaxed conversation. We had reservations for 6 pm on Saturday. When we left about 8 pm there was a line waiting for tables. Glad to see the place is popular.
October 16, 2015|Fun night|5|We were a group of five and enjoyed ordering all of the tapas and charcuterie since it is so fun to taste a variety of foods. I especially appreciated the pacing of the meal as sometimes places like this bring out too much food at once - we were able to enjoy the cold, then the warm and then the paella at a timing that allowed us to socialize and taste everything. I look forward to returning the next time I am in Providence.
October 11, 2015|Birthday dinner|5|We were a group enjoying a birthday celebration. Wonderful selection of tapas dishes and outstanding service. Adding a candle to one of the deserts was a nice touch.
October 10, 2015|Delicious tapas and paella|5|Delicious tapas and paella
October 2, 2015|Great evening|4|We had the Bocado experience for 4 ($140) - more food than we could eat. Notable were the house-smoked duck breast, veal-stuffed peppers, and eggplant terrine. All the dishes were delicious. We had the 20-oz sirloin, which came out more medium than rare as ordered, which was the only slight criticism that we had - HOWEVER, the manager stopped by a minute after it had been served and asked repeatedly if we wanted to send it back, as did our server, but we were 9/10s full and it was tender and tasty anyway so it was our only own inertia that made us keep it. Yummy yummy meal.
September 20, 2015|The service was great and the experience...|4|The service was great and the experience was worth it. However we were not impressed with the sparkling sangria that we had. In our opinion it we thought it had more juice then alcohol and for the price it was not worth it.
September 18, 2015|FANTASTIC!!|5|My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here and we were very pleased. It was the first time for the both of us and we decided to try anything we have never had before. Duck, octopus, pork belly and we were in heaven when we got our food. I would recommend this place to everyone. Only bad thing is the neighborhood but it's all good in the hood. :-)
September 13, 2015|I liked the menu and the food|5|It was tough to stop ordering tapas. I was there for dinner a little early, around 6pm, on a Sunday and it wasn't crowded at all; by the time we left it had filled up a little bit.
September 12, 2015|Fantastic|4|The food was fantastic. The environment was great. Very clean. The staff was awesome!
September 11, 2015|Good food, great service.|4|First time at a tapas bar. Loved small plates, didn't need the paella though, already too full. Service was great - knowledgeable and responsive staff. Seating was VERY uncomfortable, table was VERY small - made dinner a little tough to enjoy.
September 5, 2015|Service was excellent|5|We love the vibe of dining room... Industrial but inviting great place for a romantic dinner for two or group of friends looking for great food and spirits!!
September 2, 2015|So-so experience at a normally good spot.|3|We've been to this Bocado 4 times (and the one in Worcester 3). We like the food, the choices that are not average restaurant fare, and normally the service. It is possible that I am being dramatic about the one-star for service, but compared to the normally 3 to 4.4 star service that we usually have there, it was a noticeable disappointment last night. The food was all good, and we were excited that our daughters continued to expand their palettes, including rabbit. The calamari rings arrived cold and rubbery, as if they were leftover (not saying they were). The manager promptly delivered a fresh, hot plate that were good (and not rubbery). Given the menu and type of meal (tapas), the servers need to be more aware than at a regular 2-course restaurant.
August 31, 2015|What a fun spot!!! Food is on point, our...|5|What a fun spot!!! Food is on point, our waitress was awesome and the sangria did not disappoint!
August 31, 2015|Another Great Dinner|5|We were there on a Monday night, so noise level was very low. Food has always been great. When you order start with the seasonal items first, they seem to change at least once a month. Definitely a place to go with friends when you have time for a leisurely meal and good drinks are in order. Have been there 3 times this summer. Every time great food and service. If going on a weekend a reservation is a good idea.

August 29, 2015|Hidden Gem|5|Our server Nate was attentive and helped with our questions about each tapas and wine selection. Quick service, great atmosphere, the food was amazing! We will definitely visit again with friends.
August 21, 2015|Spanish Gem|5|The drinks were unique. The wine was excellent and our tapas plates were awesome. Our server explained the menu concept. We ordered several tapas then pailla - the combo one Excellent. We will definitely come again. By the way it is not clear on the website but there is a large free parking lot across the street as well as valet parking
August 21, 2015|Mixed|3|Great setting, great wine! Food was very mixed, from the seared tuna that was sent back barely tasted due to very poor quality fish to the outstanding lamb Popsicles, this meal was full of very high highs and equally extreme lows. Might have been okay if for instance we were offered a replacement for the inedible dishes, or if the waitress's recommended glass of wine wasn't THE most expensive on the (otherwise reasonable) menu. All turned around at the end with the craveable churros and chocolate though! Not sure if we'll be back, but would consider with a group.
August 17, 2015|Wonderful find for tapas.|5|Very interesting and inviting menu. Inventively presented and all plates were delicious. We had about ten. Seriously fun cocktails and flights. Very attentive and helpful service. Would definitely return.
August 9, 2015|Last Minute Whim turned out great|5|Made a reservation at the last minute - food was amazing- everyone was happy. Server did a good job pointing out some popular dishes. Two of my personal recommendations: 1) It is a ton of food - we did the Bocado experience for 4 - and it was way too much. Probably better off doing the tapas a la carte. 2) peach sangria- is a miss. No matter how much you like peaches, it was not good. Luckily they did not charge us and we stuck to the house sangria and the watermelon. We will be back
August 8, 2015|First of all,  this restaurant is in a l...|3|First of all, this restaurant is in a less than desirable area of Providence which was a bad first impression for me. However the interior was nice. Second, the Sangria was 90% ice and could not compare to any Sangrias I have had at other local restaurants. I tried the House White and Peach. ..no luck with either. The food was o.k. as well as the service. Nothing to rave about and not worth the money. I won't return.
August 7, 2015|Small plates, sangria, and more|5|Amazing seafood and small plate dishes! Dinner for 2 was enough to feed 4 girls for an after work celebration with some leftovers. Sangria was top notch also. Service was attentive. Would definitely come back!
August 7, 2015|Consistent great foid|5|Again we enjoyed a tasty tapas meal. We brought friends to share a celebration meal and we were so pleased. From charcuterie to dessert we were so pleased.
August 7, 2015|Fun and filling|5|We went in a group of 4 and got a ton of food. The chatceuterie and queso was tasty, highly recommend the pheasant sausage. Then we got to pick 8 tapas, and they were all good. Only problem was, by the time the paella came, we were all full! We each had a bite or two then, had it boxed up (it was good, not too salty and a great consistency), then had the dessert. We LOVED the chocolate with churros, weren't huge fans of the flan. Overall really like this place, although would love them to have more pricing options, like just the tapas and meat/cheese without the paella. I would definitely go back for special occasions, but if they had other options for deals on the tapas I would go more regularly. Also, the sangria is really good.
July 31, 2015|Great scene|4|The tapas plates have all been amazing but the service was a little lacking, albeit, it was a busy night too.
July 22, 2015|Nice selection of tapas. The staff is kn...|4|Nice selection of tapas. The staff is knowledgable and willing to make recommendations. Our selection of tapas was timed very nicely so that everything was served piping hot and we weren't overwhelmed with a ton if dishes at once. Plenty of vegetarian options. Fun experience.
July 21, 2015|Don't be turned off by the location, Boc...|5|Don't be turned off by the location, Bocado is a new york style tapas bar with outstanding food. Go for the Bocadp Experience and try something you've never had before. You won't be disappointed.
July 18, 2015|Yummy!|4|The Restaurant Week Special was an exceptionally great value! The food was great, understanding that tapas are small plates, some things could have been a little bigger (like more polenta with the asparagus/mushroom special, more cheese on the cheese plate, especially because customers needed to pay more for the cheese & duck breast upgrades. We have been to a few of the restaurants in their group (Fix & Bocado Worcester) and loved them but have to say the service was better in Worcester than Providence. The Classic Sangria was not as delicious as I'd hoped and was a let down, especially because it almost doubled our bill to get a pitcher added, but we live and learn as we try different sangria recipes at different places.
July 18, 2015|Our favourite hide-away|5|My daughter and I are HUGE fans of Bocado Tapas Wine Bar and have been to the Worcester location and now Providence. We had dinner on 7/18, but this time I brought my son who has autism. I was really worried that I would not be able to find a dish that he would like and I have to say the experience was just awesome!!! Not only were they able to accommodate my family, but my son had a really great time. I was so proud of him for being able to adapt to the different setting and menu, but also thankful that he was able to enjoy his meal. We definitely will be back and know he will have a blast. I would definitely tell parents who are afraid to take their child on the spectrum or with a disability not to be afraid, the staff is great and if you call in prior to going in you can ask for seating by the door or away from the crowd. Great job Bocado's.
July 18, 2015|A great find|5|"This was our 2nd visit here (last one a few weeks ago). The food was interesting and delicious. If you went to branch out and try different foods (like rabbit), this is the place for you. The varied small plates encourage you to be adventurous. The service is outstanding and the wait staff very helpful in both food and drink selection (my husband described the type of wines he liked and let the waiter choose his wine flight). I would definitely recommend the ""package"" option. The first time we had 3 in our party and ordered the package for 2, and the second time we had 5 and ordered the 4 person meal option. Both times, plenty of food for the ""extra"" person. Must have - the Honey fried goat cheese - to die for!"
July 10, 2015|Memories of  Tapas in Spain|5|We had recently been to Barcelona and Madrid and were craving the tapas we had many times there. This was excellent. We each chose 1 tapas to start and asked the waitress to leave the menu. We then chose a few at a time sampling some amazing dishes. Loved the goat cheese stuffed dates and the perfectly done octopus. Will definitely return.
June 20, 2015|First time at Bocado Pretty Good|4|First, the waitstaff was great. Very patient with us as we had a 2 1/2 year old with us who was well behaved, but still 2. The waiter walked us through the menu and offered suggestions which is always helpful. Drinks were good, beer list is limited, but wine list is great. As far as food goes some dishes knocked it out of the park and others were just okay. We loved the goat cheese with honey and duck charcuteria plate. The crispy rice balls, garlic shrimp, and roasted potatoes were also delicious, though some of the potatoes were undercooked. The lamb dishes were also outstanding. The cold tapas plates were just okay, and the paella was definitely our least favorite dish of the night. The rice was overcooked and underseasoned and the shellfish tasted questionable and overcooked as well. Dessert was excellent - fruity flan and churros with chocolate dipping sauce. Despite the disappointing Paella, I would definitely return to Bocado again.
June 19, 2015|Food was average at best not worth the drive|3|Sat at the bar, bartender did good job but food was disappointing
June 16, 2015|This was my first time at Bocado.  I was...|5|This was my first time at Bocado. I was very impressed with the quality of food and friendly waitstaff. This was my first time at this location and I would highly recommend it anyone. I love that you can get a taste of such a variety of food. Can't wait to go back.
Dined on June 5, 2015|Love Bocado|5|We have been to Bocado a few times and have loved it each time. We have gone for date night, for University Graduation Party, and dinner with friends. The ambiance is wonderful!! Reminds us of eating tapas in Spain. The food is great and the servers have always been super nice and very helpful. We highly recommend Bocado and hope to return often.
June 5, 2015|Experience for four|5|The Bocado experience is great, we have come several times now. The duck, rabbit, and pheasant sausage dishes were outstanding, as was the fried goat cheese.the Se√±orio de Convoy Priorat is a great wine to try.
May 24, 2015|Great place from start to finish! We did...|4|Great place from start to finish! We did the experience for 2 & ordered pitcher of class sangria. Didn't expect the duck to be cold, reminded me of cold cuts but I didn't know what to expect since I've never tried it. The tapas were delicious- especially the coquitos and the avocado & shrimp. We had the seafood paella which was an excellent choice and filled with a good amount of seafood! We took home half the tapas, paella and the desert... It's enough for another meal (for one). Definitely going back since the menu was large enough to try a lot more great food. Service was wonderful, friendly staff who explained every item that came to our table!
May 16, 2015|Love this restaurant|5|This is my new favorite place. You can go every day for a month and it can be a new experience or stick to old favorites. The selection of tapas is amazing and they are all delicious. We've now been 3 times and can hardly wait to go again.
May 12, 2015|Croquetas were amazing. But the calamari...|4|Croquetas were amazing. But the calamari was too salty and should of been more crispy. The service was outstanding. Too much mayonnaise type sauces used on the meals. You guys should do the little tapa sandwiches that are very popular in Spain. Overall great experience but might be a one time thing.
May 5, 2015|Food is Outstanding, Service was a little off|4|Went here for our anniversary dinner and were not disappointed. Ordered off the Bocado Experience - two from charcuterie and quest, four tapas, one paella and dessert. More than enough food. Only one disappointment - the red beet hummus on special was bland. The pheasant sausage was delicious. The tapas were all excellent, including the shrimp burgers which we have ordered at each visit. The paella del carne was also very good, but most was brought home. Neither my wife nor I are dessert people but she LOVES the churros and chocolate, as do I. A great way to end the meal. The only slight negative was the service. The restaurant was not busy but the waiter was only sporadically present. Although attentive when he was at our table he did not seem as engaged as I would have liked. He was good, but 3 stars not 4 (my typical highest rating) and certainly not 5.
April 19, 2015|OK but expected more|4|My husband and I had the tapas experience for two and two nice pitchers of sangria. Two dishes....the salmon/cheese plate and duck with apricot/pistachio dish were very good. Two dishes were mediocre...including the pallella which I was expecting to be exceptional based on the press. The orange chicken was OK as well. We both felt that the smoked tuna was too soft (and maybe that was our mistake...raw tuna belongs in sushi. The waitress was very honest when she said she typically spends more time at the tables, answering questions, but for some reason on this particular Sunday night, could not. I'd go again to try the other things on the menu.
April 19, 2015|"Bocado is more than a ""nibble"".........."|5|Gem of a find and so upscale and different for the Providence scene. Need to TONE DOWN the TUNES however. Just a little too brassy for comfortable dining. Been this way all 4 times I have dinned here. Great cocktails and wine lists too! thanks!
April 18, 2015|First visit was very satisfying|4|"This was our first visit to Bacado Tapas Wine Bar. The decor and feel was fun but not too noisy. We were seated (we had a reservation) very quickly and the wait staff were friendly, helpful and attentive. Food was very tasty. We chose the ""experience"" for 4, as we were 1st timers , and left full and satisfied. There are lots of choices and. It all was served in stages at just the right pace. We will definitely be visiting again!"
April 18, 2015|First time at new location|5|I've been going to Bocado in Worcester for years and have always enjoyed it. Providence is no different! We had a great time, the food was on point and the service was great. Our server made suggestions and made sure our food came out quick.
April 13, 2015|Very much like the original location in ...|4|Very much like the original location in Worcester
April 11, 2015|Fulfilling dining experience|5|My first tapas experience was not a disappointing one! We did the 4-person special and every dish they served was amazing. Our server Dean was energetic and helpful with the menu and some recommendations. After 3 hours we were very full and very happy. A great place for a long and pleasant dining experience.
April 6, 2015|I would go again to try more dishes|4|The best things we had were a special - crab and pepper dip- and the vegetable terrine with eggplant, roasted peppers and mozzarella. The piquillo rellenos, grilled venison and roasted potatoes were good. The pork meatballs with fig and blue cheese were just ok. The meatballs were a little soggy. Dessert was delicious- BIG churros, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Service was good, we had two servers and dishes were spaced appropriately.
March 28, 2015|Tasty Tapas|4|Once you figure out the menu, there are a variety of great choices.
March 27, 2015|The best calamari ever!  Melts in your mouth!|5|We had the Bocado experience which gave the four of us a great sampling of Tapas, Paella and more. The service was fantastic! The Red Sangria was wonderful. Will definitely be back!
March 15, 2015|rwhogg58|5|Our first visit to the restaurant was great. Service was excellent. Our server was very helpful with our food and wine selections. We will definitely be going back soon.

March 11, 2015|I cant get enough!|5|"I found this place online while browsing for something new and differnt to try. Now I'm hooked and go at least 2-3 times a month which is a lot considering I live an hour away. The food selection is incredible. Everything is fresh. Food comes out quickly and nicely plated. I am what you would call a ""foodie"" although I hate the word and this has a little something for everyone and a whole lot for people looking to expand their pallet. If it's wine youre looking for, look no further. The selection is vast and they have amazing little wine flights if you wld like to sample 3 wines at a time (all equalling one full glass). Not sure what type of wine you like? Explain your palet to them and they will make a great selection for you. Don't forget to order some Rose from their Porron after dinner. A fun little spin on drinking wine. This is hands down one of my favorite places to go! Servers are great as well. Very attentive and helpful if you are unsure of what you might like. It's also very inexpensive we generally get the deal for two and we never make it to the entree we always have to take it home, too full from all of the tapas!"
March 11, 2015|delicious food outing|5|a friend and I shared the special dinner-2 choices from charcuterie/cheese listings, 4 apps/tapas, choice of paella, and churros for dessert-the food and wine /drink listings are extensive and you can choose from anything on the menu. Expecting tastes of the tapas, they all seemed full sized-it was alot of food and leftovers were taken home. Many exciting dishes, different combos, everything was delicious. -our waiter Dean, when we told him we had a theater time to make, got us through all our courses smoothly and out on time!
March 4, 2015|Great dinner spot|4|Went to Bocado for the first time and tried the Bocado Experience. Loved the ambiance and vibe although it seems like we happened to be there on a quieter night. Our favorites were the fired goat cheese with honey, the beet salad, and the paella de carne. The house sangria was also great! Overall a great experience and our waiter was very attentive. Will like to come back when the weather is warmer to sit outside on the patio.
February 25, 2015|Great variety of tapas and the paella wa...|4|Great variety of tapas and the paella was wonderful!
February 21, 2015|Good but uneven...|3|My husband and I went for dinner and decided to just order a bunch of different tapas to try. Our waitress Stephanie was pleasant and attentive and made a nice recommendation for wine with our selections. The food itself was a mixed bag...the brussel sprouts, quinoa/beet salad, fried avocado and eggplant were all good, though the timing of some of the dishes was not the best. The rabbit was a bit dry and boring and the lamb chops were too salty and had to be returned for a re-do. Enough good things here that I would try it again.
February 20, 2015|Food was just ok|3|We loved the atmosphere but the food was nothing too special. We would recommend trying this restaurant because the atmosphere and food sharing is fun, especially with groups. It just seemed though that there was something missing for the price of the food.
February 20, 2015|A lovely night out in the snow|4|This place has just the right balance of lively and quiet. The friendliness of the atmosphere warms you even before you get in the door. Our server, Rachel, was just wonderful -- intelligent and helpful but not at all gushy. Everyone who came to the table made us feel like welcome friends. The tapas were varied and delicious -- must go back and try 20 more! The paella was less successful -- a bit dry -- but blazing hot and with a lovely crunchy crust of rice one ht bottom.
February 18, 2015|Truly creative tapas|4|Great prices, fun atmosphere. Fellow diners are clearly enjoying themselves. Such a good addition to Providence's dining scene. As someone who has spent extended time eat tapas in Spain, this place is the real deal. Go for the octopus alone!
February 15, 2015|"Very accommodating.
Would pass on desser..."|4|Very accommodating. Would pass on dessert - nothing spectacular.
February 14, 2015|Not the same as the Worcester location|3|I've been going to the Worcester Bocado for the past few years and every time it's been a fantastic dining experience. The food is amazing there. The Providence location, however, is very disappointing. The ambience is open and nice, and a great place for a romantic date or eating out with a small group of friends. But the food seemed like a cheap imitation of the Worcester location. The menu is the same however the food is subpar. Everything we ordered including the paella and most of the tapas were very salty and almost inedible. Maybe it was the chef that night who was being very liberal with the salt, but it was just plain awful. If you're in the Worcester area, you'll have a much better dining experience there. Much better food and much more intimate.
February 13, 2015|Great food and great date|5|Sets itself apart from a typical dining experience. Muy good chef our compliments! Tables a bit cramped though.. Better to eat at the bar for room and comfortable seating. Overall a ten!
February 11, 2015|Excellent Experience|5|We have visited Bocado in Providence 4-5 times and have had a wonderful experience each time. The tapas have been varied and we enjoyed each of them. We have had excellent service from the waitstaff and manager. We will be back!
February 6, 2015|Cold...but great|4|The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great, and the atmosphere was lovely. Unfortunately, we were seated near the entryway, and it was absolutely freezing. They had a portable heater nearby, but it certainly didn't stop the gush of wind that came in every time the door was opened. Other than that, we loved everything about Bocado. We did the experience for 4, and were pleased with every choice we made. The men were a little nervous about the small size of the plates, but were all plenty full by the end. We couldn't even finish the paella.
January 31, 2015|A total disappointment.... Will not go back.....|2|The resaurant was uncomfortably cold despite being moved to a second table. We were disappointed to find that they only serve Spanish wines. Of the 7 tapas that we ordered, only the HAMBURGUESAS DE GAMBAS (Shrimp Sliders) was enjoyable. Our main course, PAELLA DE MARISCOS, was dry, crunchy, salty, lacked any saffron essense and had very little fish within the dish. We ordered two desserts and actually returned the bread pudding because it was crusty, dry and flavorless. Enough said??
January 31, 2015|Very knowledgable staff-great experience...|5|Very knowledgable staff-great experience!
January 30, 2015|I would try it again as some of the tapa...|3|I would try it again as some of the tapas was great. The wine list is great and reasonable.
January 29, 2015|Wide range of choices|4|The menu had lots of very interesting and different (for us) choices. We can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu, because what we had was excellent.
January 24, 2015|tapas good.|3|Very disappointed with paella,ordered a large for 4 people, extremely small, two littlenecks for 4 people, and 6 mussels to share. I think we had a couple of tablespoons each. Tapas were excellent.
January 24, 2015|We had a party of 7 for a special event|5|The food and service were excellent. Lauren, our waiter did an excellent job making recommendations and providing excellent service. She made the person we were celebrating feel very special. The Tapas we chose were delicious and the Paellas were excellent (especially the seafood). I would highly recommend the location. We never felt rushed and the evening was very enjoyable. For the deserts, I am not usually a huge fan of flan, but the flan was very tasty as was the chocolate cheesecake!
January 23, 2015|Didn't meet our expectations|4|We love tapas and paella, but the paella was unremarkable as we some of the tapas. Nothing that really excited us.
January 20, 2015|5 star wine list!!!|4|5 stars to our waiter who had wonderful recommendations of both food and wine flights! We loved trying different vegetarian tapas. We LOVED the vegetarian paella and will be back for more!
Dined on January 20, 2015|Glad I tried, probably won't go back|3|"Bocado came on the radar because of recent Providence Restaurant Weeks. Thoroughly enjoyed the small plates and sharing concept. Three tapas were delicious. Disappointed in Carne paella. First it contained veal shank that was tough and chewy indicating it wasn't properly slow cooked to fall off the bone. Second the paella was SALTY. My girlfriend and I were reaching for big glasses of water later than evening. Also disappointed in sangrias. They were ""meh"". Fortunately decided to finish with churros‚Ä¶ delicious."
January 17, 2015|Worth the visit|5|"A bit off the beaten path down on Valley St but well worth the trek. Valet parking but ample street parking as well. If you've been to one of the other Bocado locations this will feel familiar but yet has it's own attraction and character. Even though this was Providence food week the service was excellent and the kitchen prep was timely. The menu has a variety of hot and cold Tapa to choose from along with four or five Paella variations if you want a ""main disk"". Wine list is extensive and Spanish in origin. Try the Sangritini for an opener.......delicious."
January 16, 2015|Lovely Experience|4|Great food and good choices. Parking was a problem on our first visit. Need more direction on where to park. We were too early for Valet and didn't know a lot was across the street as we were dealing with lots of traffic and it was dark.
January 2, 2015|Bocado Providence great find|5|We ate at Bocado on Friday evening, from the moment we were seated at the bar we were impressed. We have been to Bocado in Worchester and it was nice, Providence shined. Our waitress Lauren was informative and attentive. Without going into detail the food was excellent, we tried different Tapas from the last time and were not disappointed. Overall we are looking forward to going back. Great restaurant.
January 2, 2015|Greatt food, fun atmosphere|5|We had the tapas for three of us and it was the perfect amount of food. The tapas were fantastic and flavorful. The paella was very good but the mussels were overdone. My wife had the Mixed Berry Sangria and said it was the best she ever had. I really enjoyed the 3 x 2 oz wine flights. We want to come back soon and share this experience with more friends
December 7, 2014|Spanish Tapas, wine flights & attentive service|5|Bocado is clearly in a new section of town. We visited on a Sunday at 1:00 and practically had the place to ourselves. This is a shame. It is totally worth a visit. Each dish was exquisite. The servers were attentive and the wine selection, especially the concept of having little two oz pours, was excellent. We are planning on coming back.
December 6, 2014|Great atmosphere... so so food.|3|"The atmosphere was great. The service was great as well. But the food was a little disappointing. My wife and I love tapas and have gone to a lot of tapas restaurants even in Barcelona. The reason I bring this is up is that we would probably pickier than others. The pan con tomate was just unappetizing.. My wife said that it was gross and the bread was soggy, etc.... The salmon asado was a lot of food for the money - enough to share especially if you already had a few tapas before hand. But I'm afraid it was just ""ok"" and not good enough to order again. The garlic shrimp was good and I would certainly order it again, but it needs more garlic. This is the least amount of garlic I've seen on this dish. This dish is typically served on a hot iron skillet. The drinks were great. So in a nutshell, go to this restaurant to drink in a nice atmosphere and have mediocre food. If you're single, it's probably a good place for you to be and be seen. If you've ""been there and done that"" and looking for real food, look elsewhere."
December 5, 2014|Bocado Tapas Wine Bar|4|We prefer tapas dining. Bocado did not disappoint. The service was outstanding and the food was fresh and well presented. EVERYTHING was delicious !!
November 21, 2014|Spot on Ambience|5|Hope more people find and frequent this place in an warehouse area of Providence. Ambiance and menu were perfect and my longtime favs of tortilla espanola and garlic shrimp were perfect. Great barman, but now needs the crowds.
November 21, 2014|Had a blast!|4|Four of us had a 7:30 reservation. It took a few minutes to digest the menu, but our server (Rachel) was terrific, taking us through it step by step. We decided to begin with the 2 person combo which allowed each us of to select an individual tapa (which we still shared). The plan was to order a la carte after the combo. However, when we finished the vegetable paella, with dessert yet to come, we knew we'd had plenty. Everything was delicious - really can't suggest anything one shouldn't try. We'll be back, planning to spend another enjoyable 2 hours. Don't go if you're in a hurry; enjoy tapas eating as it's meant to be - with friends and family in a relaxed manner.
November 21, 2014|AMAZING|5|This is our 3rd time here and it is so amazing every time. Suggested a co-worker to go and they also said it was delicious!
November 16, 2014|Amazing and fun!|5|This place is our new fav place to eat. The food was incredible. The wine list was amazing and the fact that they had wine flutes made it even more fun. The prices are great. Our waitress Ash was so knowledgable and fun. We had the best date and the best food. Trying your drinks from a porron at the end is a must!!
November 16, 2014|Bocado Tapas Wine Bar Neighborhood Gem|4|Providence is lucky to have a tapas restaurant of this caliber. Everything we ordered was delicious and we were adventurous.
November 15, 2014|Really nice.  Fun and good vibe.|4|Went there as a couple and had a nice time. Vibrant, lots of people, good food. This would be a fun place to go as a group.
November 14, 2014|Total Bummer|1|First off, as a restaurant, this place falls totally short. However, this could be entirely shaded by the way our waitress handled everything that night. She seemed to not care at all when our food took an abnormally long time to come out, instead of taking responsibility and apologizing for the wait and trying to make things better, she opted to tell us that the food would be right out, even thought it never was. I've worked in restaurants for a number of years, so it's pretty obvious to me when the kitchen forgets a ticket. I asked our waitress, Lauren, if that was in fact what had happened because we had been waiting for our paella for about 25 minutes after our last course was cleared. She seemed taken aback and offended that I would have actually figured out that the issue wasn't just that the kitchen was backed up (the restaurant was half empty, other, more recent tables getting their paella before us). She then said if it was taking too long she could just give us the paella to go. Other than that she didn't offer to help out in any way. After that she avoided us as much as possible, dropped the check when we were done, and although we would have said no, didn't offer dessert or coffee. That being said, the food is also not all that exciting. I've traveled all of Spain, eaten at many iterations of Spanish restaurants, and cook both Spanish and Catalan food at home. The food here is the equivalent of what you would find at a rest stop on the highway in Spain. None of the cooking is traditional in any way, both in technique, flavor profile, and texture. The paella was a terrible disappointment, as it had been cooked in an oven, basically heated up until it was warm. The rice was mushy and it lacked the richness one would come to expect from Paella. Worst of all, because it was cooked in the oven (which the server mentioned) it could not develop the socarrat, the crusty bottom that is the most important part. All the food was on par with the paella.
November 12, 2014|Will be back|5|I've dined at Bocado 9+ times... the last 3 were in the new Providence location. Overall the food is great and the atmosphere is perfect whether you are on a date or dining as a group. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a new and different menu offering. While I love this restaurant, I do have a few gripes for the Providence location, especially where the food could be more consistent.For example, I've had calamari 4 times in Worcester, and it was delicious and tasted the same every time. However, I decided I would not get it again in Providence, as it's not the same as Worcester. First time it was slightly overcooked, greasy, and lacking flavor. The second time it was so overwhelming with lemon and garlic, I couldn't even force myself to eat it. I can say the same for their Sangria if comparing to Worcester-very different and appears to contain less alcohol. This last experience we found one dish that was unsatisfactory. It would have been delicious had the meat been up to par. This was a chicken dish with Russian mashed potatoes where the chicken was rubbery and didn't seem fresh. It gave us the impression of canned meat. Hopefully this isn't a regular occurrence, because we thoroughly enjoy dining at this establishment. Our server was awesome too I might add. Very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.
November 10, 2014|Dinner for two|4|My Sweetue and I had the dinner for two deal. It was basically 6 tapas, a huge paella, and dessert. The tapas alone were plenty. And so delicious. The dessert churros were so good, but we were too full to enjoy them! Bring your appetite and wonder at the wonderful choices!
November 8, 2014|Awesome Night|4|This was me and my husband's first time to Bocado and it was for my birthday dinner. We got there a little early and our table was ready so we got seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and suggested the experience for two. We went with it and everything was amazing. All the plates were timed just right and the food was delicious! I am planning a return trip with friends soon!
November 8, 2014|Great food|5|Terrific variety, great taste...................................................................................................................................
November 6, 2014|So Great!|5|Bocado is perfect if you are on a date for two or a huge party. Since you are able to share a bunch of small plates dinner is fun and interactive. The tapas were amazing ( get the fried goat cheese!!!) Extensive wine and Cava list. Really great service at the bar.
November 2, 2014|The food took a long time to come out.  ...|3|The food took a long time to come out. No children menu.
November 2, 2014|Very Pleased|5|"We were very pleased that we made our first trip to Bocado. Our waiter Johanissberg (John) was very friendly, attentive, and more than willing to accommodate any request that we gave him - an excellent server/waiter. The food was fantastic from the first course through the classic paella. I was blunt with ""John"" that we had read several reviews that weren't pleased b/c the paella wasn't authentically prepared due to the rice not having any crunch to it. Well, he must have had a talk with the kitchen as ours was excellent. The wine choice which again was recommended by John was spot on. We'll be back!"
November 1, 2014|Eventually it was very tasty|4|"My boyfriend and I tried the ""Bocado Experience""‚Äì it was a great way to introduce Tapas to him (a little bit of everything). We selected two options for the charcuterie board, four tapas, one paella to split and finished off with churros y chocolate. We had reservations for 8pm and it's a good thing we made them‚Äìit was PACKED! The meal took extremely long, almost 2 hours and 30 minutes. The server apologized for the delay as we got one tapas at a time, then waited about 10 minutes before the next one came. Tapas are small plates, so it's not that filling. We were starving at 9pm having only received the charcuterie. However, the food was very good and I would suggest going at a non-peak hour if you're hungry and have a time limit."
November 1, 2014|poor service|4|Our overall experience was great, however there were a few issues. The first being our server barely spoke to us. He did not offer any suggestions and only checked on us once during our entire meal which took 3 hours. It was like he was there just to take our order and that was it. He never even delivered our food to our table, it was always someone else. Looking around at other tables we noticed their servers being very attentive, offering suggestions and overall interested in their guests experience. The food was great. We ordered the experience for 2. All of our plates were great except for the scallops wrapped in bacon. They were inedible due to being way overcooked.
October 24, 2014|Stick to the Tapas|3|Just stick to the Tapas as they are amazing - loved the scrimp burger. Paella is equally bad - nothing like a real paella.
October 23, 2014|Large selection of apps and wines|4|Great, almost overwhelming selection of tapas and wines. Shrimp Sliders and Fried Goat Cheese were both great. We will be returning.
October 17, 2014|Good, but wouldn't come here again|2|"The service was not great and our tapas came out too far apart. ""Felt"" satisfied quicker than usual. Our dinner was about 1.5 long which was way to long for 9 tapas. I highly doubt we'll ever go back One good thing, complimentary valet."
October 17, 2014|Well worth the trip!|5|First time visit for dinner and loved it! The ambience modern,open and clean. Good selection/varied tapas, good Spanish wine, and one of the best paellas we've I had the seafood and my husband had the classic. Moist just enough and loaded. We will definitely re-visit soon.
October 17, 2014|Excellent|1|A very expansive tapas menu. At least 40 items, including rabbit, venison, and many other unusual items. They have a Bocado Experience special. $75 for two - includes two charcuterie items, four tapas, paella for two and dessert. We didn't order it because we knew we couldn't eat it all. Actually, we had two charcuterie items and four tapas and we were stuffed. Our waiter said that most people who order the special take the paella home. That would be another good meal for two. Excellent service, very good food. The neighborhood isn't the best, but we will definitely be back.
October 15, 2014|Titillating Tapas|5|Transport yourself to Spain as you journey through their hot and cold tapas. Truly delicious bites that will leave you wanting more.
October 11, 2014|Everything we ordered was delicious with...|4|Everything we ordered was delicious with the exception being the paella. I've certainly had much better paella, but overall the restaurant and atmosphere were pretty good!

October 4, 2014|Fabulous|5|We've been to the Bocado location in Worcester several times and love it. This was our first trip to the Providence location and it was great as well. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Bocado is the best at knowing how to pace the meal and bring out dishes at just the right time. A lot of tapas restaurants bring out too many dishes at one time, not so Bocado. Excellent restaurant, highly recommended.
October 3, 2014|Average food, overpriced,|2|Let me preface this review by saying I am an avid cook and i think know my stuff, but I also can appreciate less gourmet food. If Bocado was less expensive, the fact that the food was very bland and under seasoned would probably be more palatable. (pun intended). The food was well presented, unique menu items, decent potion sizes. The food was just fair at best. The paella was the worst paella I have eve had. Mushy rice, no bottom crunch, rubbery calamari and clams over cooked sausage, shriveled and cold mussels. It is clear that all the components of the paella were cooked separately and then thrown together.
October 2, 2014|Great atmosphere, authentic cuisine|4|My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary with Bocado and relived our honeymoon to Barcelona through the menu. The tapas stay true to the Spanish roots with classics like Tortilla Espanola and the paella. We really enjoyed the shrimp sliders. I would recommend the Bocado Experiences as it provides value while also keeping the menu manageable. We enjoyed it so much we are already planning our next visit.
October 2, 2014|Disappointing|2|We were excited to try this restaurant. This space is nice and our waiter pleasant, but completely uninformed. Food a disappointment. Nothing special.
October 1, 2014|This is truly a gem nestled away in a qu...|4|This is truly a gem nestled away in a quiet neighborhood of Providence. We will definitely go back! We went on a Wednesday night, and there were about 20 other people there. Quiet, nice and timed perfectly. Each dish was wonderful prepared and most enjoyable. The wine list is extensive, but we each chose to get a flight to taste a bit of variety. 4-5 taps for a table of two was more than enough. And the FLAN - perfect ending. Great, strong coffee,
September 29, 2014|Excellent Experience|5|"This was one of the best deals from Groupon. Even without the Groupon it would have been superb -- although we probably would have ordered less food. The tapas were delicious -- tangy but not too much. One could make a meal out of just them -- and sharing dishes with four people insured that even if one was not to your liking, there would be others that were. Totally enjoyable. One cannot say enough about the staff -- polite, friendly, efficient -- even the manager stopped by the table to check on us. Caveat: it was a slow night, so for us ""older folks"" it was perfect. Weekends might be a bit noisier, busier, etc, but the food and service will still probably be super(b)."
September 29, 2014|fun for foodies|4|so many choices of drinks and food-mix and match-something for everyone
Dined on September 27, 2014|Bocado is one of the few authentic spani...|5|Bocado is one of the few authentic spanish restaurants around Rhode Island. It has great food, service, and modern feel. Make sure you plan on spending at least 2 hours if you get the bocado experience for two and come hungry it is a lot of food!
September 27, 2014|enjoyable|5|Enjoyed all foods tried. A little overwhelming at first to choose from menu, but made out great. Would recommend highly.
September 27, 2014|This was our third visit to the Providen...|5|This was our third visit to the Providence location - we have also been fans of the Worcester restaurant. Everything continued to be excellent, our food, service, and ambiance. It was a great place to celebrate our anniversary! We will be back - more tapas to try!
September 26, 2014|Lots of choices|5|This was my second trip. Friendly, helpful staff and tons of different food choices. Interesting drinks too. Must get the paella. Beautiful presentatations.
September 20, 2014|Canal local authentic|5|What's not to say. The food and service were fantastic. It is a bit off the beaten path so unless you familiar with the area or know of the restaurant you have difficulty just coming upon it. Love the open ceilings and more rustic look. The waitress was knowledgeable and very willing to walk you through all the choices. . . a must go.
September 19, 2014|SOOOOOO GOOOD!|5|We went for our anniversary and the place was wonderful. The meal courses came slow and steady, each was amazing and it let us spend time together and not feel rushed. The big screen t.v.'s with the football game on seemed out of place, but otherwise it was a totally enjoyable night.
September 16, 2014|"Very nice change from the ""Regular"""|5|Had a wonderful meal here last night. The tapas were great as well as the entree's, including paella, we had. The wines were all from Spain. I forgot which ones we had but they were excellent. You must try this restaurant. I promise you that you will not be disappointed.
September 13, 2014|Fun night|4|Bocado is lively and great fun. Lots of choices for tapas, all Spanish wine list, proper rice in paella, good service. Highly recommend for a fun night out in Providence but I suggest you order in stages, not all at once, for a better pace to the meal.
September 13, 2014|Great food!|5|Great food. Get the fried goat cheese, it's the best.
September 13, 2014|Out of the ordinary, excellent food!  De...|5|Out of the ordinary, excellent food! Delicious, authentic paella!
September 12, 2014|Delicious tapas|5|This was my 3rd visit & this time I had a Groupon. The experience for two is TONS of food but great if you like good paella. So far the MUST-haves are: pheasant sausage & manchego (Charcuterie & Queso), the duck leg with pistachios, the rabbit, fried risotto balls & veal-stuffed piquillo peppers. The best part is that the menu still makes me want to visit again. It's got so much to offer & I have yet to have a bad meal here. So excited they came to Providence!
September 12, 2014|was good|4|I suggest ordering a la carte, as we were full after the appetizer portion. Of course we're generally light eaters, besides the fact that I am allergic to shrimp, so 3 of the 4 paellas were off the table. The service was good, but they say us kind of sandwiched between two other couples and it was a bit tight. That particular table was in the corner, so both of us were kind of facing the other tables, which was a little weird due to proximity.
September 6, 2014|Mixed Bag|2|There was no A/C on this muggy 87 degree day. That put a damper on the whole meal. Some of the tapas that were served were yummy. Some were boring and the octopus was like rubber. The paella was tasty but not the best I've ever had and it was made with tiny shrimp a few calmari rings little necks and mussels and some peas and carrots. The bill for 4 people with only one pitcher of sangria was $200. While the tapas bar idea is fun, a better meal can be had elsewhere for the price.
September 5, 2014|Noise|4|Wonderful restaurant ....if they could just do something with the level of noise. Maybe some sound proofing on the ceiling?
September 3, 2014|Nice addition to Prov food scene|3|This is a great industrial space, lots of seating, nicely designed. The wait staff was excellent. The sangria was too sweet and disappointing. The food was good, but not fabulous. That being said, we only tried 8 tapas dishes and there are lots more to explore. The best were the small peppers stuffed with veal---they are a 10. The shrimp were fresh but lacked flavor. The vegetable terrine was okay, I think I'd preferf that one hot and it was bland. When I think of great tapas, I think of Dali in Cambridge, where shrimp arrive in bubbling olive oil with cloves of roasted garlic and bread for dipping, pork tenderloin is topped with gorgonzola sauce and duck legs are bathed in fresh berry sauces. I'm hoping Bocado gets to that level soon....
August 30, 2014|Excellent Experience|5|"My friend and I both enjoyed the listed ""experience for 2."" It was a really fun experience and the food was delicious! The highlights were the pheasant sausage, the patatas asadas, and the churros and chocolate. The house red sangria was also fantastic; it was just the right subtle hint of sweetness. Another highlight was the service. Every member of the staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress, Rachel, was simply outstanding. She was incredibly knowledgable about the menu and she cheerfully walked us through the options, making suggestions about both the food and the experience. I look forward to returning!"
August 29, 2014|A diamond in the rough|4|Wow was the review I had read about this Resturant and it was right on. We had a fantastic meal and service was as good as the meal. Just make sure when you check in you mention OPEN TABLE. I received an email that I did not show up when actually I showed up 15 min early. It took sending a copy of my receipt to get it worked out but all is good now. The food renaissance in Providence continues.
August 29, 2014|Great!|5|We ate at Bocado Friday night and were bowled over by the food and the service! The quality and variety were outstanding! We look forward to returning in order to try more options, and have already recommends it to a number of our friends!
August 26, 2014|great dinner|5|I had a groupon n had been to the one in Worcester. the prov one is more open & has better food. the only 2 complaints, squid was slightly over cooked & we ordered the flan for dessert but was given churillos instead. all the rest of the food was great.
August 23, 2014|Awesome!!!|5|Fairly new to Rhode Island and I came across Bocado via Yelp. The reviews were great, the menu looked even better so I took a chance and picked it for a first date. The food was fantastic, we say at the bar and Nate out bartender was funny, attentive and just a good guy! I'll definitely be returning and telling lots about this place.. Oh and btw the date went very well also! Great restaurant!
August 23, 2014|Great meal in all respects|5|Lots of choices. We were 4 people and ordered the fixed price option, taking selections from each part of the menu. The two problems - 1) we did not get to try everything we wanted and 2) it was more food than the four of us could eat. Each selection was well prepared and an appropriate size for our group. The service was friendly and unhurried. With all the courses and small plates, the 2 1/2 hours we were at our table flew by. We plan to go back again to order some of the items we missed and to reorder those we particularly loved - like the fried goat cheese and the shrimp burgers.
August 23, 2014|Fortunate mistake!|5|"We actually booked this by accident, thinking it was another area restaurant with a similar name, and we were extremely glad that we kept the reservation! It was a fantastic evening. Both the wine & food menus are extensive. We particularly enjoyed the ""flight"" options for the wine/cava. Nate, the bartender, was fabulous. He spent time explaining the menu options, offering suggestions and opinions when asked. Hope to visit again soon."

August 22, 2014|Great atmosphere, mediocre food|3|Food mediocre at best. Cheese plate was nothing special, tuna carpaccio was dry, paella was like rice-a-roni, desert no worth a mention Honestly, felt like I was eating at the Spain exhibit at Epcot. Also, our party of 4 was never served all at once. Thru each course, there was always 1 plate that lagged behind. Also, while sangria was good...served w waaaay too much ice. Watered the taste down within a few minutes of being served.
August 21, 2014|Great date night.|3|Bocada was a great place. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, the food came out within a reasonable time. I had the dinner for 2 which was given to us a lower price because of a special they are having. (not sure how much longer that's running for) The only thing i wasn't crazy about was the chocolate sauce for the Churros, it was a very (watery) thin consistency but i'm not sure if that's how its suppose to be. Other than that The paella was great and so were the small plates we chose.
August 21, 2014|Excellent all around|5|Fantastic food and excellent service. Only complaint was the table/chair seating is not very comfortable (even though the heavy padding on the chairs might suggest otherwise, they're just a bit awkward). They accommodated our request to move to a booth as soon as one was available and we thoroughly enjoyed the Bocado Experience for 4. Servers were knowledgeable about the menu and the food just kept on coming. Looking forward to a return visit!
August 17, 2014|Great surprise|5|This has the potential to be a gem in Olneyville. We did the Bocado experience and tried 8 different items, all of which were expertly prepared. The Sangrias were also delicious. This may be our new favorite restaurant in providence
August 16, 2014|Superlicious|5|First time at Bocada. The experience for 2 was fantastic . Need to go back to try the things we didn't have. Everything tasted fresh and delicious! Very nice choice of wine and the sangria in any flavor u like was also excellent! Management waiters bartenders all extremely friendly. Some people have said the area in providence not the best but we felt comfortable and they have valet parking. Highly recommend!
August 16, 2014|Great spot!|5|"My boyfriend and I just moved here from New Jersey and we had some friends and family coming to visit us for the weekend. We went from a group of 4, to 3, then to 5 and Bocado was super accommodating in letting us change our party size and reservation time. Our server, Dean, was awesome! Explained the entire menu for us and gave us a few of his faves. We decided to try the ""Bocado Experience"" for 4 people as well as one additional selection from the a la carte tapas. It was the perfect amount of food! We also tried a pitcher of the mixed berry sangria and it was fabulous and refreshing. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"
August 15, 2014|Always wanted to try this place|4|"Not as good as I expected. We ordered the ""experience"" which as 2 choices from meat/cheese plates, 4 tapas, one rizzotto and a dessert. None of the food was outstanding...In fact the meal was meh...I put in a special request for gluten free when I ordered. No mention of it when we sat down for dinner. The fried goat cheese was ok, the duck was eh, the rabbit was eh, the salad was ok, the eggplant was ok...the vegetable rissotto was awful and the peaches and cream was something my kids could have thrown together. The best part of the night was that there was a pig roast outside with different alcohol vendors showcasing their products. The waitress was also good...unfortunately though, won't be going back."
August 9, 2014|new (tapas) kid in town|4|easy to find -large open space with a long bar- gets noisy. making it hard to hear the pleasant soft- spoken waiter at times. -one whole 2 sided drink menu-sherry flights, sangrias, wine flights and many, many wines by taste, glass or bottle, plus cocktails -and then a 2 sided food menu-tapas-fun to mix and match-the bluefish was outstanding and the fried goat cheese was second -so many choices-enjoyed it all-this place is going to really be hopping once it is discovered
August 7, 2014|Great food and wine!|5|My girlfriend and I ordered the experience for two and let me say, there was so much food! With so many delicious options, it was hard to choose for each course. She got the wine flight and loved how the wines were ordered from old world to new. All in all, the atmosphere is relaxing, great service and the food is tasty.
August 6, 2014|Nice tapas place|3|Great choices of tapas, seafood dishes, Spanish fare.
August 5, 2014|Still working out the kinks|3|I think this place was still a bit new when we went. It was a girls night out and we shared a bunch of dishes (a vegetarian side of the table and a meat eating side). The fried goat cheese is a must, the paella is a no go which is a shame because that's what this place should be about. Seemed like the rice was cooked and the options were cooked and then put on top of the rice. A true paella should be all cooked together and have a crusty bottom, not so here. The waiter was attentive and they have some great wines, I may try again another time to see if its improved.
August 2, 2014|Loud, hip, and fun!|3|The menu is massive and portions are true tapas portions, so you get to try many dishes in order to fill up...but our party of four had maybe 10 dishes and our bill was only $60 per couple...so it was very inexpensive for providence. We liked everything we ate and we even really loved several of the dishes. The yummy brownie for dessert was even quite satisfying!
August 2, 2014|Came with a group so we ordered the Boca...|4|Came with a group so we ordered the Bocado experience and the food was great. It was nice to have a break in between all the courses but the break between the tapas and the paella went too long and we didn't really feel like having the paella by the time it got to the table. We had ordered the vegetable and the classic and the vegetable was dry but that was the only issue we had with our food. I'll definitely be back.
August 2, 2014|Great food and service.    All the tapas...|5|Great food and service. All the tapas we have tried, we would order again! I also like the monthly specials. We will return!
August 1, 2014|Not impressed|3|I was looking forward to going there because of the good reviews but was disappointed. The food was below average, not authentic, and very noisy because of high ceilings and the floor plan is very open. Service was good in the beginning but later just had to wait forever for the tapas to come. And then got over charged on the bill. Overall a disappointing experience, would not recommend to my friends.
August 1, 2014|Find another tapas bar|2|We went to Bocado hoping to find that there are two good tapas restaurants in Providence. We were wrong. It's a shame really because while off the beaten path, the space is nicely designed and large. So much potential, but the food is just not very good. And it's more like small plates than traditional Spanish tapas. We won't be coming back.
Dined on August 1, 2014|Less than Impressed|2|"We arrived at Bocado ethusiastic about the environment. Built into a converted mill, Bocado has a high-ceiling open kitchen environment and has all the promise of a terrific restaurant. Unfortunately, the slow service coupled with the bland food left us wanting. We ordered the ""experience for two"" which provided a charcuterie plate, 4 small plates and an order of paella. To start, this is entirely too much food for 2 people. We noticed the waitress having to spend 3+ minutes at each table just trying to explain the menu design to befuddled customers. The only small plate worth mentioning was the prok meatballs. The lamb chops were entirely unseasoned. We tried the paella the next day and it too was underseasoned."
August 1, 2014|Flavors!|5|We have been to Bocado in Worcester a few times with a group, another couple, and as a couple alone. We have enjoyed it each time. We decided to try the Providence location when a Groupon popped up (we had not realized they opened one there). The food was just as good, if not a little better. I wasn't too excited about the open floorplan seating, but it didn't bother me, either. I personally think it is a very fair price for the quality of food you receive. Everything is very fresh, wonderfully seasoned, and well presented. Kudos to all of the waitstaff for being able to comment or recommend dishes on such an expansive and non-traditional menu. We enjoyed all 4 courses, but the Bacon-wrapped scallops were truly amazing! *****
July 29, 2014|good start|4|I really enjoyed: the authentic Spanish music, comfortable seating, authentic menu items with foodie appropriate/fancy twists (like the croquetas de pollo - best I have had). The wine list is quite good and pretty extensive. They touch on many of the amazing Spanish grapes there are, though adding Txakolina would make it even better. I went at an early time on a weeknight, so I don't know how the ambiance changes with the time of night. The restaurant stands out in its location in that it is the nicest thing around - it may be a changing neighborhood, but it still seems a bit incongruous.
July 27, 2014|New Trendy Tapas Restaurant|4|This is a nice new restaurant in a a region of Providence that is not known for its restaurant atmosphere. The newly opened establishment is chique and trendy. The atmosphere is relaxed but appears upscale and well done. The Tapas portions are appropriate, with lots of different choices. The paella was only ok. Overall, I enjoyed this new trendy restaurant.
July 26, 2014|We really enjoyed this restaurant|4|Great tapas and service! We will definitely be going back!
July 26, 2014|Erratic|3|We LOVE tapas and had high hopes for Bacado. Overall the night was mixed. Dinner for 4 took over 3 hours. We thought our server had entered the witness protection program... The room is nice- industrial chic. The food was up and down. The cheeses , flan and shrimp were wonderful. The scallop special was not even edible. The dates had such a frozen taste we left them. The paella was fair but unseasoned. I gave the restaurant 3 stars based mostly on potential. If you know tapas well, Bocado will not impress. If you are new to tapas, you likely will have fun and overlook the flaws. We will wait a few months and try again. Hopefully the management will make improvements as Bacado ages. I hope so. Providence needs a restaurant like this.
July 22, 2014|luckytofind!|5|I was so impressed from start to finish! The service was fantastic, the wine was delicious, the food just kept coming and every dish was more delicious than the last! Can't wait to go back!
July 12, 2014|Tapas for Two|5|My wife and I took advantage of Providence Restaurant Week to try a new place at the former home of Cuban Revolution. Bocado is a great tapas experience, and they are continuing to offer the restaurant week special through the summer as a way to introduce themselves to the area. Try Bocado if you are looking for a group experience or a nice foodie date night. The sangria is a good choice, but there are many fine Spanish wines to choose from. The bone marrow and the duck with pistachio apricot glaze tapas were my favorite, while my wife enjoyed the foie gras with garbanzo puree and fried goat cheese offerings. Everything we tried was prepared well and served with the appropriate timing by our attentive server.
July 12, 2014|So glad they're closer!|5|We are a huge fan of Bocado in Worcester so when we moved it became a bit of a hike - mainly reserved for special occasions. So glad to find them in Providence now. The menu is the same. The food is the same. The service was great especially for only being open for a few weeks. The must-haves are the fried goat cheese, clams and chorizo (ask for bread to soak up the sauce!), lamb lollipops and the sangria. There are a ton of options - literally something for everyone here. Plus, they know how to serve tapas: they offer assistance with the menu, they don't rush you, they bring out the plates in a logical order and stagger them so that you're not inundated. Oh, valet parking a plus too!
July 12, 2014|Loved it! Great food, lovely presentatio...|5|Loved it! Great food, lovely presentation and a really big selection. Especially good for large groups so you can try all of the tapas!
July 6, 2014|It's great to see a tapas restaurant in ...|5|It's great to see a tapas restaurant in Providence! The food and service were excellent. We have visited the Worcester restaurant many times, and are happy to have a branch closer to home. Highly recommended.
July 4, 2014| Niche Hospitality does it again|5|Having visited Bocado in Worcester many times. I have never had a bad experience, whether dining alone or with friends. It is always my first recommendation when someone asks where to go for dinner. I knew that I would be spending the 4th of July weekend in Providence with friends. We stayed in the Federal Hill area. When I found out Bocado opened a new place in Providence I made reservations. We ordered the Bocado experience for four. Delicious tapas (8) scallops wrapped in bacon, duck, a meat and cheese board, fried goat cheese, the vegetable paella. (which we took home) Churros and flan for dessert paired with a nice Sherry recommended by Nate. Our waitress was very knowledgeable (can't remember her name). Thanks Nate and JT and Niche!
