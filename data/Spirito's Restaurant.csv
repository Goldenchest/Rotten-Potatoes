February 19, 2016|Dinner with friends|5|We all had exceptional dinners. The Pasta Capri was awesome and we opted to add the shrimp which were so good and made this incredible pasta dish complete. We will definitely be back soon. We love the atmosphere of the restaurant along with the professional service we received.

February 14, 2016|Valentine's Dinner|5|First time at this location but went to Spirito's many times when in East Providence. The setting in an old Victorian House is unique as is it's past history of being used as a funeral home. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient. The food was hot and very good. Overall, very enjoyable night out with my special Valentine, my lovely wife.
February 14, 2016|always great!|5|food, service, and ambience can't be beat! Our choice for valentine's Day Dinner and it was perfect!
February 13, 2016|A Disappointment|3|"The atmosphere and service were great, but the food did not live up to expectations. My husband and I had gorgonzola stuffed garlic bread as an appetizer, which was legitimately delicious. However, everything went downhill after that. I ordered an entree that was supposed to be chicken breasts stuffed with ricotta, spinach and capicola, but there was hardly any spinach and only one small chunk of capicola present. I opted for potatoes au gratin as my side (which, in retrospect, might be a poor choice at an Italian restaurant), but this was a mistake - the potatoes were quartered and swimming in bland béchamel with a ritz cracker topping...huh? There was no cheese present; just béchamel, soggy ritz crackers, and undercooked potatoes; I was thoroughly confused by this preparation. The blandness was also a sore point throughout the evening - I'm not the type of person that adds liberal amounts of salt to anything, but both my husband and I agreed that additional salt and pepper were needed to make the food palatable. My husband had a house salad and chicken parmesan; he proclaimed the salad dressing as ""tasteless,"" but the chicken as ""crispy and juicy."" The wine selection was varied and affordable, but the rest of the food seemed pricey compared to the quality of the preparation. As much as I loved the ambience, I wouldn't recommend eating here - the service was stellar (our waitress was a rockstar - she had a party of 10 by herself and still did great servicing her other tables) the bottom line when going out to eat is that the food is good. Spirito's did not deliver on this, and even dining in an old Victorian home with an amazing server can't make up for that."
January 30, 2016|OK, but dissappointed|3|yelp rated this 4 1/2. No way. The main course of the veal Marsala and veal parm were very good as was the spaghetti bolognese However, do not order the garlic bread or ceasar salad, less than acceptable, huge dissappointment
January 30, 2016|Delicious food and service.|5|Delicious food and service.
January 15, 2016|Beautiful atmosphere, excellent service.|5|This restaurant has a Gatsby-like feel as you dine in the dining rooms. Very beautiful, as the architecture stood the test of time. We had reservations and were seated quickly. All the staff appeared happy and accommodating. Food was excellent, quality and portions. Time between courses was slow, but we rather liked it. This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry. Atmosphere and quality Italian food is why you come to Spiritos. Great restaurant.
January 12, 2016|.No recommendation to go to Spiritos|1|Spiritos used to be a great place to eat. I could not believe how it went downhill. Food was less than mediocre and certainly not appealing. I paid anyways because it was expected but I will not return.
January 9, 2016|Will certainly return|4|"1st time at Spirito's, thanks to a GC. Beautiful ""home"" turned into a very nice restaurant layout. Service was personable, and food was very good. My 100& Italian girlfriend claimed it was the best Veal & Peas that she has ever had. EVEN better than her mothers! But don't tell her mother. Will be back... very enjoyable. P.S. And it has it's own parking lot!"
January 3, 2016|Food was very good|4|Food was great even my picky 9 year old said the food was delicious

December 12, 2015|Always Amazing !|5|We love this 'secret.' We come from our home in Boston to shop at Federal Hill about every couple of months- We always have dinner at Spirito's. It's the absolute best food in Providence! (I think Spirito's is main reason we come- shopping is just an excuse to make the trip ;-) )
November 19, 2015|Super Service|5|"We had a really lovely dinner from the ""Wed-Thurs"" special menu. $40 for two included salad or soup, 2 entrees (from 6-7 choices), a full bottle of wine (3 varietal choices), and a desert. Food was excellent and the service in no way could be better. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We will certainly return."

October 4, 2015|Spiritos Review|4|Ambience of the restaurant was very relaxed and 'old world'. The waitress was exceptionally friendly, engaging and helpful. She was funny and made the family luncheon very enjoyable and festive.
September 19, 2015|Seriously this is our absolute favorite ...|5|Seriously this is our absolute favorite place in Providence, such a hidden gem. I am always grateful too for the fact that this is where my wife and I met for the very first time back for our first date. It will always have a very special place in our hearts and also our stomachs, haha!
September 19, 2015|A Great Way to Spend an Evening|5|"It was a perfect evening to spend dining at Spirito's !! Outside in the fresh air, great appetizers, wine, dinner and desert with friends. Dave and Greg always work hard in the kitchen to serve up amazing food and deserve a warm ""thank you"". Spirito's is always a great choice."
September 12, 2015|Meh|3|Not bad, but only if you're 75 years old or above. Food was average and the drinks were too. The place needs some freshening up and the food could use some modernization. The bread was a few slices of not so good packaged bread and you had to ask for olive oil, the espresso martini came in three separate vessels wasn't very good. Baked seafood platter was okay and the chicken salty was the same. Not bad and not really good. Bread pudding for dessert was the highlight of the night and don't go there if you're in a hurry.
September 4, 2015|extremely pleased|4|Our waiter John was friendly and attentive. Our meals were delish I especially enjoyed the Chicken Milanese special I ordered the chicken we crisp on the outside yet tender and juicy on the inside I ate every bite! Can't wait to go back!
August 7, 2015|Beautiful Home|5|This beautiful home converted to a very nice restaurant is wonderful. Food is excellent, service was remarkable and the overall experience I would recommend highly. We did dine on the porch Friday evening and it was a beautiful night. We usually dine indoors but the weather was perfect and no bugs. I tried their new dish the their menu which was Sea scallops and shrimp risotto. YUMMY!
August 7, 2015|Old school Classic|4|This restaurant is a fun classic. Old school Italian food, unique building. Sincere and attentive service. Convenient parking. A great experience
August 7, 2015|Father John|5|The ambience was great; Toni our server was cordial and affable and knowledgeable. We have been here numerous times and enjoy coming back to celebrate family birthdays .
August 4, 2015|consistently excellent food and service.|5|great ambiance. Servers always make us feel welcome and that they enjoy their job.
July 31, 2015|Excellent authentic Italian food|5|I took my family here for a special occasion. The service was excellent and the authentic Italian food was even better. We started with stuffed squash flowers and sautéed calamari for appetizers. They were both very good. For main entrees we had Veal Parms, stuffed chicken, Veal Marcella and several other dishes. Everyone was very pleased with the food. Overall we would highly recommend this to someone looking for good Italian food. The restaurant is located in a large old historic home that was a nice change from the typical restaurant building.
July 24, 2015|Excellent|5|Food, Drinks, Service was all excellent. Best Tiramisu ever. Will def. go back.
June 27, 2015|Terrific!|5|My family and I had terrific meals at this wonderful restaurant this weekend. Housed in a wonderful, old Victorian home, this restaurant has served thousands of terrific Italian meals to loyal (and new) customers for years! All of the veal dishes are superbly prepared. One couldn't ask for better service!
June 13, 2015|Great Place!!|4|This is the second time I've been to Spirito's and it was even better than the first time! The food is great, your glass of water is always full and the waitresses make you feel at home. The can handle bigger parties or just a table of two. Love this place!!!!!
June 2, 2015|Charming and Enjoyable|5|Spirito's is a charming venue with excellent food. Being Italian, we are super critical of the Italian entrees but Spirito's makes the A+ grade!!!
May 28, 2015|Never disappointed|5|Great food. Great service. Great ambience. The restaurant is of great historical significance

March 12, 2015|Love  Spirito's!|5|My boyfriend and I come here often. Love the food, the atmosphere, and friendly waitstaff. Linens on the tables make you feel special, too! (even if you dress casually)

Dined on February 21, 2015|Food was good, but not great. great character|4|Enjoyed the overall experience. Our waiter was just average. The building has a lot of character. The food was good, but not great.
February 20, 2015|Great Italian food, great service|5|We were on vacation from out of state, saw some tripadvisor and yelp reviews and decided to try it. First, it's beautiful inside and out. We were early for our reservation -no problem, we were seated right away. I had noted on our OpenTable res that someone in our party has a food allergy. The hostess asked about it, as did the waitress (before I could mention it). The super friendly waitress made some great recommendations and put the kids orders in first. The chicken escarole soup is amazing - my daughter said it tastes just like her grandma's. Pastas were great, meatballs too. The chicken Marsala was surprisingly light and the frutti di mare was excellent.
February 19, 2015|Great Food, Great Service, Great Ambiance|5|Excellent food and great service.... This is an excellent place; highly recommended.
February 14, 2015|Disappointing|3|"My wife and I have been to Spirito's several times in the past for special occasions and have always enjoyed it thoroughly. Unfortunately Saturday night (Valentine's Day) was an exception. After driving there in a snow storm we were seated promptly in the upstairs dining area (first time up there). The parking lot did not appear to be that full due to the weather so we were a little surprised to be seated upstairs. What the main dining area downstairs has in ambiance is totally missing from the upstairs. There were maybe 3 other table occupied and there were 2 servers working that dining area. Seems like it took an inordinate amount of time for our server to come and greet us and take our drink orders. Time between courses seemed to longer than usual also. My meal, seafood risotto was very good. My wife's dinner (the veal chop) was fair at best. She ordered the chop cooked medium and it was rare at best. Her sides, baked potato & broccoli were cold to luke warm. When it was time for the check we must have waited 10-15 minutes to get the bill back after giving her my credit card. I'm hoping this was a ""one off"" and not indicative of the service and food going forward. We will plan to go there again and we will make sure to ask to be seated downstairs."
February 14, 2015|The Best on the Hill|5|In my opinion, the best Italian food on the Hill.
January 18, 2015|Hidden gem!|5|"So, I will admit that I pulled up and was VERY skeptical. It looked like (and I later found out, used to be) a funeral home, and while we arrived before noon for a Sunday lunch, we were one of three cars in the parking lot, while the hipster place across the street had a line out the door. We decided to play it by ear and see what it looked like inside because we were in town from Boston and wanted one Italian meal in the Federal Hill neighborhood. We decided to stay based on the warm welcome we received and that all of the diners looked happy. Go here. It's not fussy or pretentious, it's some of the best no-frills Italian I have had in a while, the wine list is decent, the prices amazing, and the service was among the warmest and friendliest I have ever experience. This place should be on a Providence ""best of"" list. Loved it. In fact, loved it so much that we are planning to come back in a few months with the kids."
January 17, 2015|Consistent Excellence !!!|5|Great food, great service, attentive and always pleasurable !!!
January 16, 2015|Victorian Elegance|4|Great old house converted into an italian restaurant. Restaurant week specials were plentiful and the portions quite ample. Looking forward to tasting the regular menu. PLENTY of parking. Easy in and out.
January 16, 2015|Quite disappointing in every aspect|2|My husband and I went there with another couple. We were expecting a nice meal and good service as the restaurant had provided both in prior visits. That was not the case. Our waitress was surly. Her facial expressions and manner of speech let us know we were an inconvenience from the time we were seated. When we got our food it was lukewarm at best. The veal parm had a spoonful of sauce in the middle, very measly. At this point we were too untrusting of the server to ask for more sauce. It was actually a chore to get a second drink (either beer or soda.) It was not a comfortable night. Would not recommend Spirito's, and we have no plans of ever returning. In our opinion it has gone downhill tremendously
January 9, 2015|Great food. Love the Victorian Home layout.|5|The Italian food is really amazing here. The layout is interesting as its actually a Victorian home. Can't wait for our return visit. First of many more.
January 3, 2015|romantic spot|4|Pasta was wonderful with any you want on it, chicken , meat balls or shrimp. Seafood was cooked just right.

December 27, 2014|What a Gem and Pleasant Surprise|5|First time here and we were so pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is beautiful, and old victorian in a ok neighborhood. They have their own parking lot which is a real plus for this area. The menu was extensive and the food was fantastic....One of our new favorites...
December 20, 2014|Dinner on the hill|4|Spiritos is a wonderful neighborhood cozy restaurant. Great atmosphere, wonderful service and magnificent menu and food!
December 12, 2014|I have eaten here many times.|5|Love the decor. We used to go to East Providence more often for the early bird special. The food was great and loved the price.
December 6, 2014|Went to Spirito's on a Saturday afternoon.|4|Lunch menu had good selection. Good wine list. We had the veal parm-very good and good portion. and the eggplant parm also very good and properly cooked. Service was very good, atmosphere was nice, Be sure to save room for desert. Very nice dessert tray options, went for the Cannoli, they make their own filling , it was excellant. Best thing any reviewer can say,,,We will be going there again.

November 1, 2014|Delicioso!|4|What a fun experience! The atmosphere is charming, lots of old rooms with character. The food was awesome, some unique choices among the standard Italian fare, all well prepared and delicious. Good red gravy. Delicious dessert choices. Wait staff personable and eager to please. Can't wait to return!
October 25, 2014|Classic Italian|3|The appetizer specials were really good. The meals were average for the price range, nobody in our group of 5 had complaints but it wasn't knock your socks off either. Would have given 4 stars but while the service up until the salads was timely (this is not a place that will hurry you out the door), it was a long wait for the main course. We knew this based on the other reviews; they should sort out why the kitchen gets backed up as maybe the preparation/presentation could be a bit better. Our waitress & service staff were great, and the facility is unique. Would go back again.

October 18, 2014|Fantastic Lunch|5|I found this restaurant by reading the reviews - great choice. The lunch menu was extensive, the prices were reasonable, the staff was polite and professional, and the food was excellent. I will be returning when I have visitors from out of town!

October 14, 2014|Our weekly favorite|5|This restaurant has dependable great food and service. It seems that the wait staff here really likes their r jobs. They are efficient, personable and accomodating. I never had to ask twice for anything not even ice. The weekly specials for two dinners cannot be beat anywhere and it includes desserts!Spiritos is a good date night restaurant.Don't miss trying it .
October 11, 2014|Old School PVD|4|Great character and really good classic italian food. Veal was excellent. Make sure you take a walk around the whole place.
October 11, 2014|Outstanding !!!|5|Great food and great service. Servers are friendly and engage the younger members of our group. Helpful without being overbearing. You are served at a good pace without being rushed. Food is consistently excellent. Reasonable prices that make you want to try everything on the menu.
October 7, 2014|love this restaurant|5|A great mid week find with mid week specials. service is good and tsaff is lovely
October 4, 2014|Wonderful|5|This restaurant is must if your looking for great service, large portions and wonderful atmosphere. The pasta was wonderful and the baked seafood plate was cooked to perfection. Alex our waitres was really pleasent and quite atentive to our needs.
September 27, 2014|Great neighbor spot|5|"Great for dining as a couple for with a group. Chicken ""Toni"" the special should be a regular item - it was wonderful! Look forward to dining here again in the near future."
September 27, 2014|Nice ambiance and great food|5|Spirito's has a victorian look to it. The rooms are well-decorated and hence create a great ambiance. Food was awesome too. The wait staff and the owner were very courteous and took care of us very well.
September 25, 2014|Delicious food, elegant venue!|5|Beautiful Victorian ambiance, friendly staff, and delicious food. Park by the door. A nice selection of appetizers, house made pizzas, entrees from chicken to a delicious seafood platter and steaks, and a lovely tray of dessert offerings. Staff is friendly and accommodating, and the upstairs room can be rented for events. The baked haddock is superb, as are their Italian dishes (eggplant and chicken parm, tender veal - to name a few). They also have specials during the week (Sunday is all you can eat chicken for example). Definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner.
September 24, 2014|Fabulous Meal & Great Prices|5|My husband and I love this restaurant. The food is always excellent. We have been dining with David & Greg Spirito now for over 10 years. Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursdays they have a great 2 for special 39.95. Bottle of Wine, meal & desert.
September 21, 2014|Wonderful!|5|I loved the atmosphere, food and service at Spirito's. The wait staff is very personable and very helpful. I have visited the restaurant once before when we have stayed overnight in Providence and have gone to a hockey game. They have an great menu which is freshley prepared and the taste is amazing! My daughter loves the fettuccine alfredo. We will definately return the next time we are in Providence!
September 20, 2014|Great time|5|First time there - food and service was top notch. Would go back there in a heartbeat!

Dined on September 12, 2014|Great Place|5|Food and service is always great. Been here a lot. The old mansion this restaurant is in has beautiful woodwork.
September 12, 2014|Victorian elegance; delicious food!|5|Park by the door of this magnificent Victorian mansion, once the home of the owner of Providence's premier retail store 'downtown', or 'Downcity', as we call it here). Beautiful dining areas, many with ornate fireplaces. Attentive staff and great food. The eggplant Parmesan, seafood and pasta dishes were perfectly cooked and delicious. Sit on the wraparound porch and chat over cocktails and appetizers. Very generous helpings, weekday specials, welcoming owners and staff .
August 30, 2014|food and service|5|The food was delicious. The chicken and veal parm were great. The sauce was excellent, and the cappellini was cooked perfectly. Our server was very very good, being it was her first night here and we were her first customers! AND our first time also. She was very friendly and personable, and helpful. Sorry I can't remember her name, but she had a 'boot' on one of her feet, and she was from Salem. So we are definitely going back to try other meals! Outdoor seating is a PLUS!
August 23, 2014|Broadway Beauty|5|I have been a loyal fan of this Family Restaurant for years. And over the years it has become my Go-To for warm, family style dinning. Like being in the lovely home of a gracious friend. The food gets better all the time. Graci, Greg and David
August 22, 2014|Above Average|5|Nice place. Waited a bit too long upon arrival to be seated, but this was the only negative of our evening. The food was flavorful, presentation was there as well as portion size - WE WILL BE BACK!
August 17, 2014|It wasn't open!|1|We drove 45 minutes to meet friends who drove an hour and I wasn't open. Apparently it closes on Sunday in the summer! Ended up at Zooma and had a great meal.
August 9, 2014|Enjoyed our meal|4|I found this restaurant using open table and the reviewers comments. I was very pleased with the food and the attentiveness of the staff. I had veal and shrimp picatta, it was excellent. My husband had the seafood platter and said it was OK. the stuffing was more cracker than anything else.
August 2, 2014|just ok this time|3|Have been before and it was excellent. This time we felt rushed (and there weren't people waiting). As we were eating, busboys coming over asking if we are done with our meals- we had forks in hand and were eating and they wanted to take our plates! this happened more than once. My boyfriend's full plate of appetizer was taken from him. The serving plate was empty, she came over and asked if we were all set with this, looking at the serving plate, and I said yes, and she cleared everything. We were never told the specials by our waitress - we overheard them from another waiter. Food was just ok. Veal was overcooked, chicken had a funny flavor. We will probably go back, but it was definitely an off night.
August 1, 2014|Fantastic Find.|5|Spiritos is a great restaurant that we tried after reading reviews. We were very satisfied and truly impressed by this restaurant. I would definitely go back.
July 29, 2014|our favorite family place|5|Dining at Spiritos s is always wonderful. The food is outstanding and the staff makes sure you are happy. Everyone is in a good mood there and it is not unusual for someone in management to come make sure all is well. Danielle is our waitress and as usual she is a fantastic professional. Everyone in our party was pleased with their meal. My leftovers were great also the next day for lunch .We had a party of5.Thanks again!
July 12, 2014|The service disappointed|4|Our waitress started off very attentive and friendly. The meal was great and our table was cozy and romantic but once our meal was done and the leftovers boxed we waited almost 30 minutes for our waitress to return with the bill AFTER we chased her down. No offer of another round of drinks or dessert and coffee. It turned a nice evening out a little sour.
July 12, 2014|Always enjoyable.|5|We always enjoy the great service and delicious food at Spirito's restaurant. It is a favorite of ours.
July 12, 2014|Great Food|5|This is a beautiful restaurant with a lot of charm. The food was incredible, the service was top notch! The scallops are a must have, cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection!
July 11, 2014|Fabulous!!!|5|This was not my first visit, and I keep going back for the delicious food, wine and staff. I always have something different and I am never disappointed! Keep up the good work!!! By the way, they have the best tiramisu!!!!
July 9, 2014|Great Find|5|We found out about Spirito by buying a groupon. It was a great find that we will be going back to with our friends. The food was outstanding and the portions were plentiful. Staff couldn't have been nicer!
June 27, 2014|Good Food....Good Service|4|Good Food.....Good Service.......Good Value..........Friendly. Bus people need to relax....or they need to be managed better.
June 21, 2014|Always great|5|Have been coming here for years. Food and service is always great.
June 19, 2014|Elegant atmosphere; delicious food!|5|Beautiful old mansion with friendly, efficient staff. Many menu options with off-menu discount specials (it's lobster and steamers time!). Parking by the door and function spaces for small and medium-sized groups. Have drinks on the sweeping porch. Open for lunch as well, and great atmosphere for business meetings.
June 1, 2014|Lost in time|3|Restaurant appears as though it has not been updated since 1970s. In quiet section of Federal Hill away from vibrant attwells ave scene. Just gave us an uneasy feeling. Service was fair, and found about the same.
May 24, 2014|good italian food |4|very good italian food ..large portions with all dinners coming with soup or salad and side of pasta...well priced
May 24, 2014|Outstanding night out!|5|Made our reservations through open table which was very convenient and easy. The table was ready no waiting. The restaurant is located in a grand Victorian style home. We were seated upstairs. The atmosphere was fabulous. You could imagine the house in its day and those who walked the grand staircase. The food was delicious. We had the Gorgonzola bread, the mozzarella sticks and the Calamari. Our main dishes were the Veggie pizza, pasta, chicken Erica and steak. Would recommend any of these! The service was phenomenal. The waitress was so pleasant and we did not feel rushed, the timing was perfect. Would highly recommend dining here. The experience was superb! Looking forward to dining there again.
May 22, 2014|Outstanding food, Service and price|5|Spirito's has outstanding food and the price is remarkable. My husband and I like their two for dining specials at $39.99 per couple that includes a bottle of wine and desert. The choices on this special menu has something for everyone. You will never be disappointed when eating at this beautiful restaurant.
May 16, 2014|Must try once|2|I had been waiting to try this restaurant after many months. Finally a group of six ladies went on a Friday evening. I wasn't sure about this place when I walked in, knowing that it was a former funeral home, the carpet was old, torn and dirty. When we were escorted to the table, the room was beautiful, an old Victorian home with all its original woodwork still in tact. We ordered our meal, which took over 30 minutes to arrive. The food was good but nothing to write home about. The balsamic dressing was very watery and had no flavor at all. The clam chowder didn't have a clam in it. And the spicy shrimp was not very spicy. I am glad I visited but sorry to say, I won't be back again.
May 10, 2014|okay|2|we ate upstairs and it was like a cafeteria setting, none of the ambience that the downstairs has. The bathroom was not neat and clean and the walls need paint upstairs. The food was fair. The steaks were not very tender or flavorful, the salad dressing had no taste
May 6, 2014|You should really try this!|5|Attentive (but not intrusive) wait staff. Beautiful historic building, delicious food. Mid-week dinner special $39.95 dinner for two w/bottle of wine. Park by the door. What more could you ask for on The Hill?

April 30, 2014|Good dinner experience|4|Aside from the good food, the service made our night out. Service was exceptionally good.
April 26, 2014|WHAT A FINDI!|5|"Just a few blocks over from Atwells Ave and you'll find one of the best restaurants in RI. Spirito's serves up authentic Italian food with both great prices and large servings. I was with a party of four and everyone ended up with a take out bag. Their gravy is mild and delicious. I had the veal parm and my wife had the veal scallopini. The first thing to arrive at your table is a basket of crusty Italian bread served with both butter and olive oil. They had fried smelts as a ""special"" appetizer. They are a favorite of mine and some of the best I've eaten. The atmosphere is as good as the food. The atmosphere is where you would expect the prices to be a lot higher than they are. The staff is great and friendly."
April 26, 2014|very good food in a nice setting|4|The veal was very tender, the portion was a little small. very good bread also
April 19, 2014|A quiet gem|4|"When you're finished walking Atwells Street and sitting in the sun on the piazza by Venda Ravioli sipping a cool drink, try Spirito's for a quiet late dinner. It's away from all the ""young noise"" and commotion of down-town, but not too far away. The restaurant is housed in an old Victorian mansion and the furniture and decor is comforting and a little less than elegant. The food is typical Italian- not great, but plenty good. We go there every time we're in Providence. Just LOVE the whole experience of eating there! I think if you try it once, it will be come a favorite of yours too."
April 12, 2014|Always a great meal....very|5|Always a great meal....very consistent! Wait staff is friendly and we repeatedly go back.
April 5, 2014|Consistently Excellent !!!|5|My family and I always enjoy Spirito's because we know we are going to have a great meal with great service. Take the time to visit and next time you'll be going back with friends.
April 4, 2014|We had a party of 4 and none|1|We had a party of 4 and none of us enjoyed our meal. The food was was bland and tasteless. The homemade balsamic salad dressing was just water. The gnochis were mushy and for $18.95 we received very small portion. We were told that a bottle of wine was 25% off, so we ordered a bottle, when getting the bill, we handed in our groupon and were told you couldn't use two specials. I don't know why the groupon should cancel out the wine discount....We opted to use the groupon, since we have no intention on going back.
March 26, 2014|Birthday Dinner|5|I always like to spend my birthday with my family, but as the size of our group continues to grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a spot that can accommodate us all and still give that feeling of intimate family dining. Spirito's was PERFECT!! Our table was charming, the decor of the restaurant inviting, the staff friendly and courteous, the wine list more than satisfactory, and the ambience delightful! It's an added bonus that it's a small, locally owned restaurant - a little gem in the west end of Providence!
March 25, 2014|Great Experience!|5|As always...food was great, service friendly and attentive, and surroundings simply lovely!
March 23, 2014|Lovely Luncheon|4|Our experience at Spiritos made for a pleasurable Sunday lunch. Our server was fun, witty and knew her stuff. Overall the meals delighted with everything one expects from a quality Italian restaurant. One member of our party requested an item he had seen on the lunch menu and our server was quick to check with the kitchen and place his order. My husband felt his sauced Angel hair pasta and meatballs was a trifle watery but it did not stop him from cleaning his plate! My order of Eggplant Parmesan was tender, oozing with melted cheese and large enough to provide lunch for the following day. The Chicken Marsala dish was picture perfect and enjoyed. Adding to the ambience of the exquisite Victorian house is the ease of the huge parking lot.
March 19, 2014|Great For Lunch and Dinner|5|as always, excellent food and service. Looking forward to Spirito's again.
March 15, 2014|dinner special|3|the dinner special was awful. fried all panko and hardly any fish at all for $24.95.. the eggplant parm was excellent. would go back but would only order an italian entree. no seafood or dinner specials, italian or not.
March 11, 2014|Old Italian with a touch of flair|4|"Interesting place, traditional ""old"" Italian menu, a few bright spots. The stuffed quahogs were absolutely delicious, best we've ever had. This is the kind of old school Italian-AMERICAN fare you would expect Billy Joel to rave about in the 1970s, with Mama Leoni-style pasta dishes and lots of dinner entrees to choose from. Surprised by the extensive wine list and the dessert tray was very appealing. The restaurant has a lot of history and local flavor, considering that it is also the very first Italian-American club in the country. We would go again if we are looking for a semi-casual and reasonably priced place to dine on Federal Hill."
March 8, 2014|We have been to Spirito's|4|We have been to Spirito's on several occasions. We tried different things each time, and it has always been very good. Would recommend to anyone asking.
Dined on March 6, 2014|Amazing building and good food!|4|"I read many reviews, many negative, but some outstanding. I suspect this is the type of place you either love or hate! I can see some issues, especially about some of the food quality. Store-bought pasta is embarrassing, with so many local options, but the ravioli and the "" bullet shaped"" pasta is locally made & excellent. Our waitress offered that information, so we went with that. Our meals, 3 of us, were really good. I suspect ordinary jarred garlic, and much prefer fresh, but my veal florentine w/mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes was divine Why powdered cruddy Parmesan and little butter packets? Bread was great. The building is EXQUISITE...worth the trip for sure! Without that, maybe a B-, but I give it an A, with room for improvement."
March 1, 2014|A Disappointing Evening|1|With so many restaurants to choose from, I thought this one would be special for a birthday celebration. However, someone must have quit, and the waiter was so taxed, that our dining took 2 1/2 hours with an hour between appetizers and salads. What a shame because we were upstairs, and when the food reached us, it was not hot enough. I think it was due to a lack of wait staff. I bet the food would have been good if it was hot.
March 1, 2014|Spirito's is our favorite|5|Spirito's is our favorite restaurant. It offers everything. Good food, good price, good atmosphere and excellent service. We love Italian food and I live in a state that has many great italian restaurants. We feel Spiritos is one, if not the best, in the state.
February 21, 2014|Classic Italian|4|Settled in an old neighborhood mansion, Spirito's is old school Italian all the way. They offer classic dishes prepared the way they've been doing it for hundreds of years. You won't find anything crazy on the menu, but it's a very solid offering with lots to choose from. Definitely would go back. Our service was great, and the setting is unique. Worth a trip if you're looking for good food with no fusion neo-modern flair.
February 16, 2014|Good experience|4|Spirito's is easily accessible from Rt 95. The setting is a marvelous Victorian with high ceilings, chandeliers and decor. The food is very, very good, tasty and generous. Their Bolognese pasta rates with the best i've had and my 2 dining companions were very pleased with their food and first visit. The lemon cake was something to go back for in their opinion. Each of my visits has been very satisfying, trying different foods on the menu. I will be going back for more. Thanks Spiritos!
February 15, 2014|Wonderful Experience!|5|We made a reservation for 7 and arrived during a snowstorm. We were thrilled that the restaurant has it's own parking lot and it was plowed. The staff was ready for us and the waitstaff was wonderful. The meals were delicious. Would happily dine there again!
February 14, 2014|Restaurant in a mansion!|3|Went for valentines day with a group of 4, and host was very accommodating. They don't have a bar, but a lounge area. The restaurant doubles as an Italian-American social club, and that sets the tone of the place. Waitstaff was attentive, but food took a bit, maybe due to the holiday. Very cool space, feels like an old mansion.
February 14, 2014|another great meal!|5|"I wish we could afford to eat at Spiritos on a more regular basis. Not to say that they are overly expensive just not in my budget for regular dining. We arrived late (30minutes) due to traffic on 146 & 95. My wife and I thought this would mean a long wait to get seated (especially seeing that it was Valentine's Day). We waited no more than 15 minutes, a very pleasant surprise. Our server, Danielle was very funny, great personality. My wife and I shared fried calamari with peppers for an appetizer, excellent! My steak a la mama was cooked perfectly and my wife's veal & shrimp piccata was, in her words "" melt in your mouth perfect"". Another wonderful dining experience at our favorite restaurant."
February 7, 2014|excellent|5|first time but not last time. great dining experience
January 31, 2014|Great meal|5|I went there with my wife and the food was great and the service was wonderful. I would recommend Spirito's to everyone.
January 29, 2014|Spirito's on Broadway in Providence|5|Awesome place! Awesome food! Great service! How can you go wrong? We had the Wednesday night dinner for 2 - it was $39.99 and it came with a bottle of wine......best dinner we had all week!
January 29, 2014|We had lunch with friends|5|We had lunch with friends and had been to the restaurant previously. As always the food was excellent, our waitress outstanding. Spirito's is a very lovely restaurant with lots of charm. The décor is outstanding.
January 25, 2014|can you add/hold this to perfection|4|All around this off-the-hill restaurant is as good and in some cases better than being on-the-hill. Broadway being the next street over from Atwells makes it a simple and truly easy find. Choices were many and our table for 6 went in every direction; fish, poultry, classic Italian, can you add this, can you hold this, etc. - so you would think that one of the plates would not be very good or a mistake, therefore a diner that wouldn't be too happy. NOPE, not the case. Each plate came out cooked perfectly and every add or hold was spot on. GREAT JOB - from Toni our dining host in getting the details right and to the kitchen for making it all happen!
January 25, 2014|Will stick with Italian next time!|4|My husband loved his meal of veal brachiolle and spaghetti. My meal of filet and lobster was just ok. The filet was not great quality with 1/2 of it inedible because of white bands within the meat. Not sure why it was butterflied, although it may have been to mask the quality of the filet. The lobster was good though . Next time I will stick to an Italian or pasta dish. I've done that in the past and I have never been disappointed.
January 18, 2014|The Chicken Parm to end all others|5|Without any question Spirito's has a regular menu that can rival anything on Atwells Ave but the dish that is a must here is their famous Chicken Parmasean. It's pounded by hand breaded and fried to perfection which retains all the juice which pops in your mouth that first bite. Immediately hit with nostalgia that takes you back to that very first time you had Chicken Parmesan as a kid, only this is better. So if you every find yourself with a craving for Chicken Parmesan then you better book a table here so you can get the real deal experience you'll be talking about at work the next day.
January 18, 2014|We were seated within minutes|5|We were seated within minutes of our arrival. Frank, our server, was prompt in greeting us, taking our drink order and reading off the specials. My wife and I split an appetizer, the scallops wrapped in bacon. There were 4 nice sized scallops cooked perfectly. A nice start to the evening. We placed our dinner order, shrimp scampi and fruiti de mara. Both entrees arrived in short order, piping hot and smelling wonderful. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her scampi and the fruiti de mara was a huge plate that I was only able to eat half of. We then split the teramisu which was light and very flavorful. A beautiful end to a wonderful meal. Frank was attentive without being overly intrusive
January 17, 2014|Very generous amounts|4|This lovely building has been transformed into a wonderful, friendly restaurant. The food portions and sides were more than generous (including my manhattan!) , the prices reasonable,the food was delicious, and the menu was varied with loads of specials. A really nice alternative (with GREAT parking) ot the madness on weekends on Federal Hill. The service was a bit slow, but I liked the opportunity to be with friends and we weren't in any hurry. The rooms are small which kept the noise down.
December 18, 2013|Great place!!|5|We had a wonderful private dinner then attended a gathering upstairs. A great night out!! The food both for dinner and at the reception upstairs was outstanding.
November 30, 2013|Concern for Open Table|3|Sadly when we arrived the restaurant did not have our reservation. Open Table had confirmed it. Not sure what the problem was but this restaurant did not have the meet and greet area of the restaurant running well. The Hostess was often missing in action. The wait staff had to push by patrons to get to the kitchen, etc. They were putting leftover food in the take home containers right there in the reception area!!!! Thankfully the food and service were very good but I hope they make improvements in the reception area.
November 8, 2013|great Italian dining|5|Spiritos restaurant has everything you need in a great nite out.it is an a beautiful old mansion in the city the food is second to none , best Italian style cuisine. Definitely return visits. And also a beautiful place for any kind of special occasion..
October 5, 2013|For the most part the food|4|For the most part the food and service were excellent, although one of the people in our party did say that his food was not hot when he received it.
October 5, 2013|Outstanding delight !|5|The food is like being back in Italy. Good service in a unique surrounding. The menu is extensive, the portions are large and the food is always hot. You are not rushed to eat between courses but you are not waiting long to be served. The service is friendly. What a great way to spend an evening at dinner.
September 21, 2013|Nice Restaurant|4|Very good meal. Waitress was upbeat and helpful with recommendations. Enjoyed it very much.
August 31, 2013|Amazing as always! We dine|5|Amazing as always! We dine here often and are always extremely satisfied with the service, the food, the ambiance. Spiritos has it all!
August 31, 2013|Warm and inviting with great food|5|"Very quiet restaurant in a beautiful restored mansion. Nice elegant atmosphere without feeling ""stuffy"" - wait staff very friendly. Water glasses were refilled quickly. Food portions were large and the quality excellent. Great for a romantic evening, business dinner, or dinner with friends. Would not take small children here."
August 3, 2013|Good food...lots of it!|3|Everything about Spirito's is good. You are keenly aware that the owner is making every effort to please his guests, and I believe with great success. The place was very busy for a Summer Saturday night in Providence. There are plenty of offerings of traditional Italian food to choose from as well as specials. The portions are generous, the preparation excellent, and everything is good. Prices are reasonable, though I thought the specials were pricey. It's not Al Forno, but when you're in the mood for home style Italian, it's a good place to go.
August 1, 2013|Delicious food and awesome|5|Delicious food and awesome service.... Family owned restaurant and manager was super welcoming and had awesome suggestions
July 20, 2013|Wonderful dinner|5|Spirito's allows us to set the pace. We prefer to take our time with appetizers salad and drinks before dinner. We always enjoy our dinners at Spirito's. Their food is unique and delicious.
July 20, 2013|Good food good people|5|Very well prepared meals for a good price! Nice people from the owner to the staff! Was not Italian and they still welcomed me! Cool!
June 29, 2013|Good Food, Great Feel|4|I really like the victorian building for this wonderful neighborhood eatery. The food is wonderful, if they didn't run out. In our case, a couple of items were already gone, so a little disappointment. One personal peve of mine is when there is not a complete description of the food item. In this case, the gorgonzola garlic bread said nothing about being covered in balsamic vinegar, on the menu. When it arrived, it was, and so I could not touch it. Other than that, everything was wounderful. Nice wine list, including by the glass, and wonderful creme brulee.
June 15, 2013|The food was good, service|3|The food was good, service was very good however the dining room itself needs to be renovated and updated.
June 13, 2013|Nice night out|4|Enjoyed dinner for 6 the other night. The 3 course dinner special with a bottle of wine was just right for all of us. Our meal choices included, veal, chicken, and eggplant. Each dinner was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and had a great sense of humor. We will be sure to return.
June 1, 2013|Great meal. We did not expect|5|Great meal. We did not expect to have steamers but when we heard they were available, we gave them a try and they were the best we've had anywhere in the state. Actual meal was excellent - had the surf & turf - which was perfect. Had to run to a show so we couldn't stay for desert but the oreo cheesecake and chocholate lava cake looked great and we'll be back some day to try them both. Having their own parking lot is a great feature that was not lost on us. Overall a fantastic experience and while this was the first time here, it will not be our last.
May 18, 2013|Beautiful and accommodating|5|We had to change our reservation more than once and not only did they accomodate our party but the service and food were spectacular. A rare gem and a rare find.
April 27, 2013|Error in Open Table|3|The restaurant called me after I made the reservation to say that they thought they had blocked the time out as unavailable, and they could not honor the reservation. Forcing me to fill in the ratings when I didn't go is idiotic, but I will do it so I can submit this survey.
April 20, 2013|The food was excellent and|4|The food was excellent and the atmosphere was as well. Enjoyed our dinner.
April 16, 2013|Spirito's was a fun experience|5|Spirito's was a fun experience - great atmosphere and food with a very accomodating staff. The Polenta & Sausage appetizer (large enough as an entre) was outstanding. Would not hesitate to return or to reccommend to family & friends.
March 23, 2013|This was our first time at|4|This was our first time at Spiritos and we enjoyed it. The service was outstanding and the food very good. Reasonably priced. I've been in R. I. for 3 years now as a consultant working with several other consultants here. We have been eating out once a week at a different restaurant each time. I would certainly put this restaurant on my top 10 list.

February 15, 2013|casual atmosphere, serious food...|4|Its an old house and you can tell...but, food is really solid homestyle Italian and worth every penny. Excellent wait staff, great prices, and essentially a casual and fun night out in an old Victorian. Being just off the hill, and having their own free lot, makes this place regular material. Check it out.

A real value and you will always have left overs to enjoy at home. Week day specials are dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine & desert for $39.95. We love it!!!!
January 24, 2013|To Grandmother's House We Go......|5|"Highly recommended!! Really impressed with this restaurant. Did not expect the ""ambiance"", it was like being at your Grandmother's house for Sunday dinner...GREAT feeling!! The food was also a nice surprise! Their ""gravy"" was quite good and the veal dishes too!! Service was another PLUS...thank you Danielle for making our evening even more fun!! Spirito's can give the ""other"" Italian restaurants in the area ""a run for their money""...GO and you WILL AGREE....they will leave you wanting to return to their wonderful customer service and delicious ""down home"" Italian food (and Buono's bread too)! All they need is the Card Table set-up for High/Low/Jack after dinner!! Thank you Spirito's, another star for our list! We'll return!"

January 19, 2013|A nice, interesting place to eat|4|"Spiritos is located in a fascinated old Victorian, it's like having dinner in somebody's house. The food is very good, but not quite up to some of the best on Federal Hill. The exception is the tomato sauce which is excellent. The veal parm and chicken parm were both pretty standard fare. Service was slow but not obnoxiously so. Seemed like the staff was stretched kind of thin the night we were there. Also it was restaurant week, which might have had an effect. Parking is in a private, secure, well lit lot which is a nice difference from up on the Hill. Overall a fine ""just off the Hill"" choice for Providence."
January 19, 2013|A Neat Find in the Providence area!|4|We ate at Spiritos for the first time last Saturday night - it was restaurant week in Providence and we took advantage of the $29.95 dinner for 2 which included bread, soup or salad, your choice of entree, with pasta or potato and vegetable and a dessert. It was a different dining experience - big, old house with many rooms to dine in. The host was friendly, food and service was good, and parking available on premises was a bonus - we would return when in the RI area.
January 19, 2013|Reservations are a must on|4|Reservations are a must on Friday and Saturday. Had to wait for our table, but not to long. Food and wine was great! Service was on the slow side so don't be in a hurry. Waited almost 1/2 hour for dessert. Not sure why, but other than that had a great waitress and a great time!
January 19, 2013|"We went during ""restaurant"|3|"We went during ""restaurant week"" and had the special 2 for 1 menu....so the entree choices were limited. The parking was ample....a big plus in Providence. The area where we sat could have used more light...difficult to see menu. The bar area was just another room with tables...no actual bar. Overall a good restaurant but not one we would be anxious to return to....with all the other choices in the area."
January 19, 2013|extraordinary Italian food.|5|"extraordinary Italian food. Our group of five all had ""special orders"" to go home with us after the meal in house. These were all prepared with care and good spirit even though it greatly complicated life for our server, Ariana. I believe she is fairly new, but she was superb in both her attitude and her helpfulness in selecting entrees, etc. The setting is a delight; beautiful Victorian atmosphere; high ceilings; rich and elegant woodwork and furnishings. Why a 4 instead of a 5 for Ambiance? Don't know, really. Just felt it couldn't all be 5's. This restaurant is unique on Federal Hill and should not be missed."

The tomato sauce that accompanied the polenta was delicate and tasty. We would not hesitate recommending Spiritos and would certainly return."

This time we dined at the height of the holiday season so the place was decked out for Christmas. The dining area was crowded for a Thursday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. so we were glad we had made reservations via Open Table. The food was consistently good. The waitress warmed up to us after a while - by the end she was joking around with us and made us leave feeling like regulars. We will definitely return. It's a solid dining spot with good food and a friendly atmosphere.

All customer service staff were smiling and telling us they were glad we were there that evening. The menu is traditional Italian fare. My friend had the fresh fish w/mariana and the roasted root veggies. Ample portion of fish and veggies .. so fresh and tasty. I opted for pasta bolognese. Again more than ample portion with a ""gravy"" that was pure comfort food. Accompanied by ""slabs"" of the freshest bread, plates of the freshest basic salad mix....even with two glass of house wine, we spent less than $30 each. We will be back!"

It was a busy night because it was the last night to use your Groupon. Our server was accommodating but you could see the stress and she mentioned it a couple of times. My husband and I knew what we wanted but were surprised when we overheard another server mentioning the specials to his table, that we knew nothing about. However, the food was hot and good. It could have been hot and delicious but they are very light on seasoning. My only suggestion is to add a little salt to enhance your flavors. We will definitely be back!

The waiter we had was fantastic made suggestions,always there when you needed him and was also witty. The food was delicious. The calamari was very tender could almost melt in your mouth. The whole meal was phenomenal. I must say that the Tiramisu was the best I have had.

September 22, 2012|meh|3|I hadn't been to Spirito's in about a year; I went for the Shrimp Francaise, but it is no longer on their menu. I got baked stuffed shrimp and was happy with it. We had trouble seeing our menu due to the dim lighting. I was seated next to the dimmer switch and tried to make it slightly brighter, but someone quickly came over and darkened the room again without asking why we may have tried to make it brighter. Interestingly, light bulbs were burnt out in the same light fixture for our last 2 visits. Service was EXTREMELY slow. No chocolate on the dessert tray. I doubt I will get my husband to go back.

September 18, 2012|Spirito's dinner for two for|5|Spirito's dinner for two for 40.00 is a fantastic deal. A three course meal and a bottle of wine mde for a very pleasing evening. The restaurant itself is elegant and filled with old world ambiance. Our waiter, John, was efficient, patient, and accurate and his sense of humor delighted our party of four. Both soups (chicken escarole and lentil) were delicious as were the very fresh house salads. Three of our four diners enjoyed the tender veal while the other raved over the delicately prepared eggplant. Accompaniments of various types of pasta and fresh vegetables were cooked just right. Spumoni and cheesecake were selected by our group and both finished off the meal making it a perfect evening.
September 15, 2012|Awesome|4|Such a beautiful place. I love the victorian home that they turned into a resturant. Its has a romantic setting and of course the food was better then the Italian food you get on the Hill! I will definetly be back!

August 8, 2012|First time and won't be the last|4|I took some colleagues from work out to dinner and was taking a chance on Spirito's because I'd not been there before. Well, we were not disappointed. The location is a beautiful victorian house with ample parking. Our hostess was polite and receptive and our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. We enjoyed everything we were served. The best part of eating out is being treated like you're the most important priority. Spirito's made us feel like we were. Thanks.
July 31, 2012|We have never had a bad meal|4|We have never had a bad meal here. The food is always consistant. We live all the different rooms that are available to dine in. Give it a try, I'm sure you won't regret it.

Sincerely, Ken Polselli
May 11, 2012|Although most of the food|3|Although most of the food was very good (party of 4), I had the misfortune of ordering the baked seafood platter. The fish and scallops were tasteless and textureless. The crab also lacked flavor. The stuffed quahag was dry and lacked flavor. The stuffed shrimp were just OK. The majority of the dish was left uneaten with no desire on my part to take it home. I was never questioned by the waitstaff if my meal was acceptable. Overall the dish was very disappointing and should not be on the menu at all especially in the Ocean state where good seafood is easily found at most fine restaurants.
May 11, 2012|Always Exceptional|5|Spirito's is an exceptional resturant. Chef David puts heart into every dish that is served. You will not be disappointed in your dining experience. Best Calamari in the world - melts in your mouth.
May 11, 2012|Loved the Victorian living|5|Loved the Victorian living room feel; cocktails were enjoyable and there was a variety of reasonably affordable wines to choose from for the table. Entrees were typical for an Italian restaurant but the specials were the highlight for some. Service was very friendly, warm and attentive. We will definitely be back with friends. It was a relaxing and pretty setting for our graduation party.

May 1, 2012|Very good!|4|We celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday at Spirito's. It was our first time dining here and the food, wine, service and atmosphere was very good! The prices were a bit high, so I can only see going here on special occassions. Overall it was a good experience!
April 28, 2012|A great Italian meal|5|Fantastic, old-school yet expert Italian dining experience. Great food, great prices and set in a beautiful Victorian house perfect for the Federal Hill setting. We had a party of 6, but they could easily accomodate an intimate dinner for 2. I also appreciated the professional waitstaff who were attentive but didn't overdo it.
April 21, 2012|the service was very slow.|3|the service was very slow. it was an hour and 5 min from seating to our food being brought and we did not order an appitizer.

April 14, 2012|The restaurant was very pretty|4|The restaurant was very pretty inside. Based on pictures on the website it appeared that you would need to dress for dinner. Atmosphere is less dressy and a nice pair of jeans and a top would have been fine. The wait staff was very friendly. Food was good, just not great. Meals did come in large sizes and there was plenty.
April 14, 2012|Great Food, Service & Charm|4|This beautiful, historic house creates a wonderful, cozy setting for a great dinner with friends. We will definitely return to try more delicious food. Extensive menu with good variety of dishes with a unique touch. Many interesting specials. Warm, friendly service by entire staff, including the owner. Excellent veal - hand-pounded thin & tender with flavorful veggies. Our friend raved that the lamb special was outstanding. Generous portions made with fresh ingredients. Tiramisu was good, but a little heavy on the coffee flavor. Overall, a definite winner! Easy to locate with ample parking. Looking forward to dining outside in warmer weather. We'll definitely recommend Spirito's to our friends.
April 7, 2012|Right off the bat we loved|4|Right off the bat we loved that it's located in a historic house right on Broadway. Kind of tricky to get into though because there's three entrances but only the front has a sign to enter through the back. Food was good and inside the house was beautiful. We enjoyed it a lot.
March 31, 2012|The food is good here but|3|The food is good here but this location is so stuffy and old! I loved their previous location in East Providence. It was alive, cozy and friendly. This Providence location is set in an older home.The wait staff runs up and down the stairs to the kitchen everytime you ask for something and it really feels as if you are in a converted funeral parlor. The food is good but due to the atmosphere I just can't recommend it to anyone. This was my second visit to this location, wasn't happy after the first visit but thought I'd give it another try but I don't forsee myself and husband returning.

March 30, 2012|The atmosphere was relaxing|5|The atmosphere was relaxing and we liked the fact that there more than one room to dine in. The food was fresh, served at a good temperature. The fried calamari was light and very tasty. The homemade, house favorite, stuffies were exceptional. We enjoyed the wine selections we had as well. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. This was our first time dining here and we have already made a reservation for this upcoming week.
March 24, 2012|Great food, slow service|4|Waitress was good but the kitchen side of things needed help . . . very slow . . . over 1 hour to get main course.
March 13, 2012|My husband and I took friends|5|My husband and I took friends from Florida. Our friends were so impressed with the excellent food,and ambiance. A true treasure in the Federal Hill area of Providence. They also have specials Tuesday-Thursday. A bottle of wine and dessert with your meal for about $40. What a deal!!! Affordable and delicious. Calimari is the best. Melts in your mouth.
February 25, 2012|Simply the best|5|The food was fantastic, from the Spirito’s Farmers Special appetizer of cannellini beans over bruschetta and the light and tasty Fried Calamari. The evening’s special of melt in your mouth Veal Osso Buco served with mushroom risotto was superb. The tasty Baked Seafood Platter with an ample amount of succulent scallops, lump crabmeat, two large stuffed shrimp and a stuffed quahog were baked to perfection, all this in a casual and friendly atmosphere. A must try.
Dined on February 22, 2012|Awesome, lucky find. We were|5|Awesome, lucky find. We were visiting Providence for a college tour, and found this restaurant. The food was outstanding - from the fried fresh mozzerrella and fried quahogs to the fresh, crisp salad, to the Lobster and Shrimp Arrabiata and Lobster Ravioli in Pink Sauce. But the real star of the entire meal, besides our amazing waiter, was the bread pudding dessert. Warm, sweet but not too sweet, and moist beyond expectations, this was the best bread pudding we've ever had. Here's hoping our daughter picks this college - so we can come back to Spirito's.

February 14, 2012|Came here for Valentine's|4|Came here for Valentine's Day 2012. The restaurant itself is in an old Victorian house, which makes for a unique setting. We had a table downstairs so we cannot vouch for the upstairs portion, but both the girlfriend and I were pleased with the setting. Food was good and moderately priced. She got the Chicken ala Mama and I had the Shrimp/Lobster pasta. Quick service no complaints.
February 14, 2012|I think the lack of ambience|4|"I think the lack of ambience was due to the fact that we got seated upstairs in a smaller room which made it feel very ""banquet"" esq and awkward for all that were seated up there. I wish we had been seated downstairs and had a better waitress. But it was overall a nice spot for special occasion dinners with a romantic partner."
February 4, 2012|Let the Spirit move you...|5|Frank our waiter made our dinner experience a pleasant one!!! Food & service was excellent...will be back with friends!!! The best tiramisu...gives Boston's North End a run for the money!!! Spirito's will not disappoint you... The chef will prepare gluten-free entrees if needed.
January 28, 2012|Our party of 4 went during|2|Our party of 4 went during Restaurant Week to celebrate 2 birthdays. We had reservations, arrived early and waited 35 minutes past our reservation to be seated. The bar area only has tables for two. We were told 3 times someone would take our drink order, after a long wait we got it ourselves. The restaurant has many dining rooms as it is a grand old building, we were seated at a table in the hallway in front of a door. It took another 30 minutes to order our food. The food was good but very slow coming out of the kitchen and no one checked in on us to see how the meal was until they came back with the next course. With so many Italian places in Providence, this restaurant most likely will be off our dining list for the future.
January 28, 2012|Food was good, not great.|4|Food was good, not great. Soup was bland and cappocinno was very small cup for $4.50. If you want great Italian food, Federal Hill is the best.
January 27, 2012|Italian cooking at its very|5|Italian cooking at its very best. Truly a gem. The Victorian style building and interior is truly beautiful and gives a special feeling to your dining. Dress is casual. Menu has something for everyone and it is moderately priced. Offers Tues-Thurs a Dinner for 2 including desert and a bottle of wine for $39.95.
January 21, 2012|We went for dinner on Restaurant|4|We went for dinner on Restaurant week. The quantity of food we got for the price was terrific. Also our dinner was scrumptious.
January 20, 2012|Our server was friendly and|2|Our server was friendly and attentive, but the food was neither very flavorful nor comparable to what is available at the many fine restaurants a few blocks away on Atwells Ave. There obviously were some returning, regular guests dining there and I'm sure their opinion of this neighborhood restaurant differed from ours. Some (but not all) in our party thought that the aura of the building's prior life as a funeral parlor was unpleasant.

And the prices are very reasonable. The strolling guitarist was the icing on the cake. Even the ""hard to please"" one in our group has stated that she ""loved this place""."
November 30, 2011|Great Victorian house that|4|Great Victorian house that includes a wonderful restaurant. The atmosphere was very nice with the rooms having 15 foot ceilings. Also the restaurant had a wonderful large parking lot. The food was excellent. Top notch all way around.
November 12, 2011|The food and service were|4|The food and service were excellent. Even had some Italian dishes that most Italian Restaurants don't offer. This used to be a funeral home that was converted to a restaurant. To me that is a little creepy, but they did a nice job with the conversion, but more could be done to make it look as though it was never a funeral home. There is a children's menu and the prices are good. Plenty of parking.
November 8, 2011|This is my second time dining|5|This is my second time dining at Spirito's. Just fabulous - plus it was nice to see that they kept the history of this magnificent structure!! So impressed that I took some friends back last week - they were equally impressed and plan on taking their friends!!! So - a ripple effect has begun - word of mouth is the best possible advertising. Looking forward to my next visit!!! Thank you!! Gail
November 5, 2011|Great for a group|4|We took a chance and went to Spirito's for an early dinner before a show at Lupo's. We chose this restaurant due to the variety of choices on the menu (chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian) since there was 6 of us with varied diet choices. Our server was friendly and prompt, and the food was reasonable quality and portion - especially for the price. We loved the decor/ambiance as well. Everyone in the group said they'd return.

October 8, 2011|We were very disappointed|3|We were very disappointed that the service was so slow! Our reservation was at 6:30 and by 9:30 we were ready to get out of there! We even skipped dessert (my favorite part of any meal) just to end the waiting! Other than that, the food was good - but would never go back there again!
October 7, 2011|Outstanding Italian food & ambiance|4|Spiritos has an Old World Italian charm with outstanding food to match. I will definitely go back. We experienced a variety of chicken and veal dishes that were all delicious. The ambiance in this old treasure of a mansion was also a treat. The architectual details are amazing. Also, reservations are extremely easy with Open Table. Skip the high prices and parking nightmare on The Hill and definitely give Spiritos a try.
