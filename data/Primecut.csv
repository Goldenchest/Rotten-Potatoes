February 12, 2016|Food/service -- Friday night|3|The food was great... Portions were just right - not to big or too small. Service was so slow in the beginning and there were hardly any other customers. I counted 7 waiters and 2 bartenders and it still took us 17 minutes to get our drinks from the bar. The check came two seconds after we finished eating, so we felt rushed. The food was really delicious, so that's it's only saving grace.
January 17, 2016|Primecut|3|This restaurant is very nice and I really liked the upscale feel to it. The food was delicious however, it did take a long time for our orders to come out which was odd because the restaurant was not full at all. Our server was okay but was hesitant to take me and my friend's drink back after we took a small sip and realized we didn't like the way it tasted. He called the manager over and the manager of course granted our request to get new drinks. There's a lounge right across the restaurant that looked pretty fun. The only downside is that there was a concert happening so in order for the restaurant to tune that out, they had loud house music playing which wasn't really ideal for dinner.
January 2, 2016|First time, good impression|5|A co-worker recommended this place so I treated my husband to New Year's dinner after the crazy mobs of people. We had a nice quiet dinner and shared the special $99 steak. I can't recall the name but it was delicious! The service was superb and the ambiance was relaxing. Not bad for a first time. I hope to come back again!
November 28, 2015|Romantic Anniversary Dinner|5|First time visiting and was very impressed. The food, waitstaff, ambiance were perfect! We both got the filet mignon and was the most tenderly cooked I've ever had. The lighted menus were a hit due to the low lighting which was very nice and romantic. The outside fireplace was lovely on this chilly night and very inviting setup outside. We will definitely return in the future.
November 14, 2015|Amazing food!!!|5|Primecut is a hidden gem of a restaurant. Comparable yet better than Capital Grille. The food is amazing. I've had the best filet there and a great scallop special. The sides are to die for. After dinner you can enter the lounge Mezzo for a night of dancing!
