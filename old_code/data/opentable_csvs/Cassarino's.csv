February 27, 2016|Brian Fall River|3|The service was kind of poor but the food was fantastic.
February 27, 2016|Great Service|4|We arrived about an hour early do to a quick basketball game. They were able to accommodate us with only about a fifteen minute wait. The food was delicious and the helpings were enormous. An entrée got you two full meals. I also asked them to add sausage to the gnocchi, they did it with no hesitation. Well done!!
February 27, 2016|Great dinner spot on Federal Hill|4|Nice spot for an Italian dinner in Providence. It was really crowded on Saturday night, so reservations are a must on weekends. Three of us in our party got the linguine with clam sauce (white and red). Both sauces were excellent and the clams were very fresh. Great portion sizes!
February 27, 2016|Cassarino's|5|I absolutely LOVED eating here. Cassarino's is just as good, if not better than any Italian restaurant that I have been to in the North End of Boston. We weren't rushed out of the restaurant and the chefs took their time to cook the food. The food was very fresh. I had a delicious house salad with balsamic vinaigrette for an appetizer and for dinner I had the pasta primerava with olive oil, which was the best that I have ever tasted. The vegetables that they included blended well together. The vegetables included capers, olives, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and broccoli. Also, the tomato sauce is the freshest that I have ever tasted and is well worth trying. Also, an added plus is that they accommodate food restrictions very well even though they don't have a separate gluten free menu. I have a gluten intolerance and a dairy allergy and they were able to easily substitute any pasta dish with gluten-free penne pasta and replace with Italian house dressing (which had dairy in it) with balsamic vinaigrette. The atmosphere was also very spacious and the staff was very friendly. This is definitely my new favorite Italian restaurant!!
February 27, 2016|Awesome time at Casserino's|5|Casserino's is my favorite restaurant on Federal Hill. Great food, great service, great time. Staff was very pleasant and attentive. Food was delicious. Staff attentive to requests. I have been going to Casserino's for over 15 years and have never been disappointed.
February 26, 2016|Cassarino's never disappoints!|5|"We took our son and his new girlfriend who were up from Florida to Cassarino's to celebrate his 25th birthday. The food was excellent and service great as well, as always. They wanted to try something ""very Rhode Island"" and I suggested Cassarino's because it is our favorite Italian restaurant on the hill. The calamari was really awesome, best around."

February 20, 2016|Best place on the hill.|5|Great food, great service, free valet parking. The chicken marsala was amazing.

We had to ask for menus, my napkin fell on the floor, the waiter noticed immediately, picked it up before I noticed, forgot to bring me another. We both ordered Veal dishes, but were given butter knives to use to cut. Food was good, but not up to their usual standards. We have been many times in the past, and had great meals and service, but this was not one of them.

February 15, 2016|Lunch on President's Day|4|As always, food is delicious. My sister, mom, and I shared calamari and Caesar salad then each had an entrée. I also had a nice glass of Riesling. I only gave three stars for service because we had a young man who although very nice, wasn't very polished in terms of serving in a nice restaurant. No biggie though. Won't be long before we return for the umpteenth time!!!
February 14, 2016|Perfect date night|5|Cassarino's has become our Valentine's dinner tradition for the past 5 years. You will need to make reservations in advance for any weekend or holiday dinner. If you can, request the top floor by the window for a beautiful view of the city and federal hill area. We love this place for a delicious meal in an intimate setting, and reasonably priced. Downstairs is more casual with a full bar, but upstairs has a more quiet romantic atmosphere, with the third floor being my favorite for the view. Complementary valet is also very convenient in the Federal Hill area. We've never been disappointed and plan to return for years to come <3

February 13, 2016|Always fabulous - always delicious.|5|My mother is from Italy and is a phenomenal cook. I am very choosy about where I eat Italian food out. Cassation's is as close to eating in my mom's kitchen as I get. The food is never a disappointment. The waitstaff are all very friendly and at the top of their game. I always request a seat on the second or third floor at the window, overlooking Atwells Ave. For me, at night, the view is gorgeous.
February 13, 2016|Excellent establishment got there 20min ...|4|Excellent establishment got there 20min early and was seated right away b4 the rest of the party arrived was given plenty of time to chat and look over the menu didn't feel rushed at all even though it was Valentines weekend the waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines and food very helpful in decision making the bread was fresh and warm the food was great for the rest of the table my meal was a little dry but it was a 1st time special the meal was cheap though for 4 people and 2 bottles of wine was under $210 that's with 3 apps and desert which was awesome definitely go back again
February 13, 2016|Kerrie|4|Was very busy to be expected Valentine's weekend. Seated on time for our reservation. Food and service was great even with a busy night . Great night
February 13, 2016|Great food, horrible service.|2|The food was delicious, as usual. This was a Valentine's lunch for my wife and I. Our issue was with the service. We were seated at the same time as 2 other tables. We ordered drinks and an appetizer. No one ever dropped off bread, as they did for the other tables. Our appetizer arrived and we were eating it, still with the large menus on the table and without anyone checking on us to take our order. Finally our order was taken after we completed the app (while holding our menus on our laps. We had to ask twice for bread, and it finally came after our meals arrived. The waiter never came back for me to order a second beer and our water glasses were empty for the entire meal, only refilled after I requested it when ordering dessert.
February 12, 2016|Service was disappointing. The assistant...|3|Service was disappointing. The assistant was always very prompt, but the main server was very slow & aloof. We ordered the baked herb goat cheese (very good), bracciola (very dry), Gorgonzola crusted sirloin (good), and a cannoli (very good). Their red sauce was not as good as some of the other Italian places on Federal Hill.
February 10, 2016|Lunch|4|Brought clients for lunch during a convention at RI Convention Center. Quick cab ride or 10 minute walk. Service was great and atmosphere was friendly and quiet enough to chat during lunch without straining to hear. We had a group of 6, and the server had a custom made ap platter that was fantastic. Everyone enjoyed their meal. J would go back for lunch or dinner with friends and clients.
February 6, 2016|Appetizer never came but dinner was good|4|The slip for our calamari got lost. Was comped for a half portion. Dinner and drinks were delicious
February 6, 2016|Great meal!|5|Always a great meal. The calamari always makes the trip worth it.
January 31, 2016|Continue's to Impress|5|We went to Cassarino's after a PPAC Matinee Sunday show. They offer free Valet parking. Not overly crowded. It's been a couple of years since we have been to this restaurant. Sat on the first floor rear seating area which was very comfortable. Had the toasted ravioli which was good but not a wow factor. The entree's were very good. Service was adequate as our server was busy with several tables. Servers work as a team which was nice. In my opinion Cassarino's remains one of the best Italian restaurant's in Federal Hill and a great value. Highly recommend.
January 21, 2016|No good|1|It was unfortunate because they had a beautiful live music playing evetything was fell flat! The steak no flavor! The vegetables were oily, how can you mess up vegetables. Because the steak was bad I need A-1 sauce and the sauce bottle was empty.. It took forever to get the attention of our waiter, so we just got the check. Calamari were over cooked and dry, this is RI national appetizer, to over cook seafood you lose all its flavor and texture. Mariana sauce, this is an Italian restaurant, the red sauce taste like canned sauce. The wine, I had seven daugthers moscato and it seemed dry, maybe the bottle was left open and that's why it was bad. Overall I would never ever go back it was the worst food in RI..
January 21, 2016|Restaurant Week Specials|5|I love Cassarinos!!! The restaurant week menu was unbelievable. My BFF and I had Caesar salad and Calamari for starters. Both choices were full sized and delicious. The rest of the meal was just as excellent. Balsamic filet and Chicken Casalinga. Yum. Dessert was delicious too. Had a great server, but I am afraid I can't remember his name. It was a great evening. Can't wait to return. Wasn't my first visit and won't be my last, by far.
January 20, 2016|Restaurant weeks|3|We came here on a Wednesday night, the food was good fairly good size dishes. The waitstaff was young and seemed to lack experience. The restaurant itself was very average compared to other restaurants we have tried during restaurant week.

January 16, 2016|Awesome place|5|Cassa Reno's is in An amazing place for a romantic dinner with someone very special. My fiancé and I loved the food and the service was outstanding. We will definitely be going back there again soon
January 16, 2016|Restaurant week|4|We went there to celebrate a birthday during restaurant week on a Saturday at 12:30. They told my daughter they were not using lunch menu on a Saturday and that was not stated on restaurant week website. When she said we would not stay they gave us the lunch menu. The food was good, service was very slow. Maybe the kitchen was too busy with not enough help.
January 16, 2016|Cassarino's- Federal Hill at its finest!|4|The value at this place is second-to-none on Federal Hill whether you go during restaurant week or not. Their lunch and dinners are authentic and delicious with large portions and a reasonable price. Their wait staff are always cordial, professional and attentive. We love Cassarino's, whether for business meetings or celebrations with family and friends.
January 15, 2016|Great Food and Dining|5|My wife and I stopped in here after she picked me up at TF Green after a very long week in Las Vegas. The food was outstanding and service was wonderful. My wife had the sausage and Rabe with gluten free penne. I had the Seafood Alfredo with a side of Rabe. Everything was OUTSTANDING. I'm a bit of a rabe connoisseur and usually prefer my own version, but this did not disappoint. The only disappointing thing was my failure to order a second helping to take home. We split the molten chocolate cake, and while it was very good, it was missing the molten center. We really enjoyed the leftover meals for lunch the next day! We can't wait to go back and try some new dishes. Thought the price was very reasonable. Excellent value for the money. Great dining experience.
January 14, 2016|A Must Experience !!|5|Cassarino's is a treat for the eyes, ears and palate !!! The service was fantastic , a jazz combo played ithebackground and the food was beyond excellent !!! Nothing but great here !!
January 13, 2016|The Perfect Lunch|5|This food experience was amazing. Visually, the calamari appetizer was a perfect golden brown. My son said it was the best he had ever eaten, immediately rating Cassarino 20 on a 10 point scale. A Caesar salad, steak tips, frutti di mare, cheesecake, and tiramasu made this a food lover's perfect experience.
January 10, 2016|Awesome!|5|Food was fantastic! Waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.
January 9, 2016|Amazing service and food|5|The food was so good from the appetizers to the entrees. Our server Michael was amazing.
January 2, 2016|Anniversary Dinner|5|I love this restaurant! It is my absolute favorite on Federal Hill. My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary and we were NOT disappointed! I ordered the Scallops Aurora and it was absolutely delicious.......the only thing I would have liked more was if there were more scallops in the entrée.........My husband had the pollo rabe and that too was delicious! We also ordered the calamari with the balsamic glaze, also delicious! Everything we had, right down to our drinks (red sangria for me and Bacardi and diet coke for my husband) was outstanding! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend and we will be going back there ourselves very soon!
January 1, 2016|Classic federal hill restaurant|5|Have been numerous can times and always very good. Last time ate at the bar and was very enjoyable

December 19, 2015|Very nice night.|5|We have been here before. Once again, we were not disappointed. The waiter was excellent. Knowledgable, attentive, and with a great attitude. We were celebrating my sister in laws birthday. Reservations for 6 people for 7 pm. Providence was buzzing with the Waterfire Weekend. We were not rushed at all. Very comfortable and quiet. The food was fantastic. I see a return visit soon. Very well done, very well done. 👏

November 11, 2015|Great food and nice atmosphere|4|It took a little while for the server to make contact with the table after being seated. The manager did stop by to let us know that the server would be there momentarily, but it still took a while after the manager touched the table. When she did arrive, she was fantastic. The food was phenomenal and came out in a timely manner. The server had great timing with firing the courses. It was only a few minutes after appetizers were finished when the main courses arrived. Very nice atmosphere. While there was music playing, it's not what one would think of when going to an Italian restaurant. It wasn't unpleasant, but I would have preferred the typical crooners like Frank or Dean rather than the Dave Matthews that was actually playing. Overall, it was a great night with great food and and good service.
November 7, 2015|First Visit - Fabulous Food|5|We made reservations on Open-Table based on reviews and availability. This was our first visit to Federal Hill, we were headed to the WaterFire Gondola ride and time was short. We got our food very promptly considering the restaurant was packed full. We ordered fried calamari with the balsamic glaze - it was incredible! I could have eaten a full order myself! We ordered the Pollo and Rabe and Pollo Parmagiana. Being raised by an Italian father, broccoli rabe was a staple in our home. The Rabe was the best I have had out! Lightly sautéed in Olive Oil and Garlic with a sprinkling of prochuitto.... delicious. Sadlly, we had to rush through our meal, but had a most understanding waiter who got us out quickly. We can't wait to go back!
November 7, 2015|Fantastic Meal|5|I went to Cassarino's as part of a large group. Our table was ready upon arrival and we were seated promptly. Our waiter was courteous and attentive. Cocktails and wine were tasty. We ordered calamari and bruschetta and both were delicious. The main courses were superb! Even though it was a busy night, we never felt neglected or rushed. We will definitely return to Cassarino's!
November 2, 2015|More, More More!|5|I am so happy that my friend recommended Cassarino's. Both the food and the service were top notch. For lunch, the portions were huge. I will be back for more!

October 17, 2015|Mediocre at best|2|Waited 50 mins for our food. It wasn't like it was prime time. It was 9pm. The place was more empty than full. 50 mins and the food was just ok. Mediocre at best. Would not go back again.

October 10, 2015|great time|4|Even though they were slammed due to the columbus day festival, they took good care of us and we enjoyed a great meal. Our server was excellent.
October 3, 2015|Food was good, atmosphere was not|3|Table for 2 - we were seated in the middle of the 2nd floor seating area. We had a large table next to us and a large table behind us so it was loud. Heavy traffic area. Not the least bit relaxing or romantic.
October 2, 2015|last minute|4|Needed to find a table on the hill last minute on a Friday night for 8 people. This was the place! We had young and old and everyone was happy. Very kid friendly and overall comfortable place. Service was well above average.
September 28, 2015|Great meeting place|4|The food was excellent and it was a great meeting place, it allowed for great conversation and fostered a level of comfort that is rare in most place.
September 26, 2015|Family Birthday Dinner|5|We made a reservation for eight people to celebrate a family birthday. There were 6 adults and 2 little girls. The hostess took us upstairs to our table almost immediately upon our arrival. Our server was very attentive without being overbearing. We all agreed that our meals were superb! We spent more than 2 1/2 hours and had a wonderful time. The place is a bit noisy, but it didn't diminish our excellent experience!

September 14, 2015|First time dining.|5|I'm a first time diner at Cassarino's and it was hands down one of my best dining experiences. It's a classy, non pretentious atmosphere. Our server was knowledgable , attentive and had a great personality. The food is amazing, hands down. Everyone loved everything they ordered. I'm definitely going back.

September 12, 2015|Great Time|4|I came to Cassarinos on a triple date my boyfriend and friends. We all had a great time and the food was amazing. I had the lobster ravioli and it was delicious.
September 12, 2015|My fett. with shrimp and scallops dish was bland.|3|Overall I feel as though we will probable not be back. It was very hyped up by coworkers etc. My Dish though was very bland I had the fett. with shrimp and scallops. My boyfriend had the fruti De Mare and his was better then mine. Our server was not around very much. We had the calamari as an app. and it was alright very bland as well. It was my birthday and the restaurant was notified and nothing.

September 10, 2015|Very impressed|5|This was my first time here; it was recommended by a friend of mine who lives in Rhode Island. I had the Chicken Cassarino and it was delicious. The portion was huge also. My wife had the Lobster Ravioli and she loved it. By the way, she's had lobster ravioli ast a lot of places and is a picky eater - so I know oit had to be darn good. A friend of ours had the filet and raved about it; though it was too big for her to finish. It looked awesome and I was tempted to try a bite, but I had so much on my own plate that I knew I had to concentrate on that. I also had a small salad to start and it was good. The italian bread they served with the meal had a proper crust while remaining fluffy inside - excellent bread!! My wife and I will definitely be back.

August 27, 2015|Good food at a reasonable price|4|We went to Cassarino's for lunch with a group of six and the food was very good and the prices were very reasonable. I would recommend it for lunch. They even have free valet parking, which is a blessing as parking on and around Atwells can be hard to come by.
