February 13, 2016|Ey|3|Alcohalic drinks were terrible, we went on saturday before valentines day. We ordered several drinks and had to keep asking for them to be fixed. Food was good but not incredible. Was very loud but that is to be expected when it is open to the hotel lobby. We won't be rushing back.

December 31, 2015|New Year's Eve|4|Food was suprisingly good although the menu was somewhat limited. Service was good. A little pricey but not as bad as other New Year's eve set menus. Nothing stood out as being awesome, but for a decent sit down dinner it served its purpose.

September 15, 2015|Less than average|3|Was very disappointed with this restaurant, service was ok, new waitress. Was their for a food challenge and found the food almost unpalatable. There are better choices in the area.
August 29, 2015|Surprising Find|4|With a weekend stay at the Marriott Providence with plans for a show at the VETs, I had hopes of dining close to the VETs. When I found that many others, who were attending the show had the same idea, I had to look elsewhere. What a great surprise to find such a fine restaurant right in the very hotel where I was a guest. Our waiter, Daniel, was very polite, attentive and friendly. Except for the music, which was very annoying, I would not hesitate to dine at the Bluefin Grille again.
May 16, 2015|A little disappointing , but the Tuna Was a Winner|3|This restaurant was not what I expected based on the reviews and pictures that I saw on line. The facility is right off the hotel lobby and it was rather small and not very nice. The biggest problem was that the glasses of Rose wine we ordered smelled so much of dishwasher soap that we asked for replacements. Would you believe even the second glasses also had to be exchanged. Eventually our waiter got it right and we were able to enjoy our wine without soapy residue. The best part of the evening was my Ahi Tuna dish which was excellent. I even asked our waiter to tell the chef how much I enjoyed it. The presentation was great and the tuna was some of the best I have had. The chef, Juan, even stopped at the table to say thank you for the compliment.

The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was as fresh as ever, all in all great dining experience

My wife told the hostess that we came at the recommendation of the television show. She offered to have us speak to the chef! We were thrilled. Our first course was the small neck clams. Delicious! Next, I had the Lobster Bisque and my wife had French Onion soup. Both were outstanding. Bisque was smooth, creamy and savory. Onion soup had the perfect amount of melted cheese and caramelized onions. The sweetness stumped my wife, but the chef told us it was made with a Medeira wine. He just came out to meet us as my wife was finishing her soup. Next, I had the Seafood Scampi and my wife had the Pan Seared Scallops with Butternut Risotto. Both dishes were great, and plenty for us to take home. Our dessert course was my wife and I sharing the Boston Cr√®me Cake. Tiny in size, but perfectly blended pastry, cake filling and chocolate. We highly recommend Bluefin Grille.
