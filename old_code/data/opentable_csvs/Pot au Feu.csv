ays ago|A Fantastic Evening!!! Highly recommend!|5|You all need to experience the wonderful service, unique ambiance, and deliciously satisfying food at Pot au Feu! My daughters and I celebrated my birthday. We were treated like VIPs from the moment we walked in the door until our fond farewell. Service was exactly what it should be--friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, and professional. We started with the escargot--so tender--perfect with the restaurant's warm freshly baked bread. The complimentary organic salads of baby greens were a prefect touch--with such yummy home made dressings. Go for the blue cheese! Our meals--steak frites, beef bourgignon, and half chicken-- were all perfectly prepared. Attractively plated, hot, and so delicious! Very generous portions had us all bringing home leftovers Dessert of creme brûlée and pot au chocolat were the perfect finish to a magical night. Both the owner and chef checked in with us during the evening. On every level the personal time and attention made our evening a delight! A night to remember! Highly recommend!
February 27, 2016|Service was unacceptable|1|We didn't get seated until almost half an hour past our reservation. An hour after we were seated, our entrees still hadn't come, and we had to leave. The appetizer was good.
February 27, 2016|Seating horrid - decline in food quality|2|"I have been to the restaurant on a few occasions. Prior experiences offered excellent food, service and ambiance. I made reservations over 2 weeks before 2/27/2016. Made 2 follow up calls to the restaurant verifying same due to my last 2 Open Table reservations were not on record when we arrived at 2 different restaurants. It was an Open Table issue that necessitated follow up calls. We had an early dinner time of 6:30. I dropped 2 women companions at the door then parked blocks away. When I arrived at the restaurant found our party had been seated at a table obviously there for the night - inches from service area entire wait staff trying to do their job while encumbered by a patron table in their way. I asked about relocating to a different table (7 were empty) was told ""they are reserved"". I responded as was ours weeks ago. This being a special event for one of my guests I did not escalate or make a fuss. If this were just a dinner out I would have left to seek other arrangements. The staff was overwhelmed with work ( staff worked very hard and were pleasant - simply not enough staff) , several menu items were 'out', noise level at our location prevented real conversation. My meal was awful, shrimp and scallop dish served cold with a runny sauce, vegetables were also cold and overcooked. My guests said there meals were fine (they were being polite). I will not return to this location and have retracted my positive reviews to family and friends. Shame the one true French bistro in the area has gone downhill."
February 26, 2016|Pot au feu and the Providence French Film Festival|5|"I was visiting Providence, as I do every year, for the Providence French Film festival. I was staying with a friend who has moved to Jamestown. He went to Brown, but he, his wife and his aunt had never been to the Pot au feu. It was a good thing that we did go there, because the experience at the Pot-au-feu was the bright spot of the evening. Even with the presence of Geraldine Pailhas, who acted in the film and whose daughter attends Brown, the film ""Le dos rouge"" was a disappointment. But not the restaurant. I think that we will remember the dinner we had here long after we have forgotten ""Le dos rouge"""
February 26, 2016|Food a disappointment.|4|Been enjoying the Pot au Feu since they first opened. Never had a bad meal or felt disappointed until our last visit. We both selected the Bouillabaisse and agreed it was the worst we have ever had anywhere. At $32 or $34 dollars it should have had some actual fresh shell fish and white fish in it. The cod had passed it prime, the scallops were tiny bay scallops that were tasteless and rubbery and the shell fish was a joke without going into anymore specifics. It was a huge disappointment and will make us think long and hard before going again. The bread, pate and salad all seemed to be less tasty than in all of the past visits. The room was not even half filled on a Friday night so we wonder what the future holds. Very sad to see this happen.
February 20, 2016|Birthday celebration|5|Food was good company was great,restaurant was lovely what more could we have asked for. There we're eight of us and plenty of room around the table. Service was great. Thanks for a great night!
February 20, 2016|Love this spot, owner so nice as well!|5|My wife and I visit for special occasions, typically our anniversary. The owners, host is so nice a true gentlemen. His staff is super nice and his chef skilled! The dinner spot is totally like in Paris as is the flair of the room. Parking easy, the walk nice and the vib perfect. Five stars!
February 14, 2016|Very poor service|2|Went on Valentine's Day and it looked like extra tables had been crammed into the space. Waited 45 minutes to be seated, then another 30 before anyone even stopped by the table. Service slow all night; very little checking in. Saw the bread girl more than our server. 3 hour meal. Food was rather bland compared to previous visits. A couple of unopened shells in the bouillabaisse.
February 13, 2016|Overpriced - Disappointing|2|Overcrowded seating. Waitress & staff kept bumping into us & our table. Cocktail made incorrectly had to be sent back. The salad was no better than what I could have gotten from a packaged bag from Stop & Shop. One meal overcooked, one meal under cooked. It may have been a little better if it wasn't the Saturday of Valentines & if we gotten seated near a wall instead of in the middle of the room. Our bad luck of the draw I guess. The overall experience left me feeling as though I would have been better off throwing my $140 out the window as I drove by. No Valet parking on a zero degree night should have been enough advanced warning that service wasn't a top priority of this establishment
January 30, 2016|Great expereince to return to Pot Au Feu|4|It has been a very long time since I was at this Pot au Feu and am so glad I rediscovered it. The food and atmosphere was great!
January 22, 2016|Great Feu!|4|Good food, but great desserts. Went for restaurant week so reservation was necessary. Main course was a bit cold but lobster bisque appetizer and crepes and chocolate mousse for desert were outstanding!
January 15, 2016|This is one of our favorite places in Pr...|5|This is one of our favorite places in Providence. We went for my wife's birthday dinner. The food was tremendous and the atmosphere was excellent. The owner stopped at every table and talked to every patron in the restaurant. You generally feel welcome. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and made perfect recommendations. This is far better than any of the expensive steakhouses in Providence. You can't beat it for a special night out.
January 15, 2016|Overall nice experience|4|Appetizers great. Escargot was amazing. Entrees were not on the same level as the appetizers. Ambiance and overall appearance added to experience. The food could be slightly improved to validate the prices. Friendly staff.
January 13, 2016|romantic french cafe|5|We've been coming here for birthday and anniversaries for almost 40 years. As good as ever! Beef bourguignon and creme brulee to die for!
January 8, 2016|The escargot was outstanding. The best w...|5|The escargot was outstanding. The best we've had since Paris. Food was authentic and so delicious. We met the owner and the chef; both were attentive and kind. Can't wait to go back.
January 2, 2016|The food, as usual, was very good.  Alth...|4|"The food, as usual, was very good. Although the service was prompt and the food was served hot, the server made two serious errors on the bill which should have been detected before the final bill was presented to us for payment. That aspect of the experience left a ""bad taste"" in our mouths. Unfortunately, this experience will make us overly vigilant in the future which will be unfair to those servers who will bear the brunt of our sour experience. That said, this will not deter us from dining there in the future simply because the food is sooo good!"
December 31, 2015|Always a treat|5|We have always been fans of Pot au Feu and try to make it at least once a year. The food is always amazing. Hardest part is deciding what to get there are so many favorites. One thing that is never a question is saving room for the Crème Brulee, simply the best.
December 31, 2015|Wonderful Experience|4|We dined here on NYE and it was great! A show was offered upstairs with a special menu but we opted to stick with the regular menu as we had a separate event to attend following dinner. The foie gras was absolutely delicious and went well with the warm bread being passed around by an additional waiter. We ordered the salmon dish and the beef Bourguignon (chef's recommendation) and both were yummy. The one drawback was the lobster bisque wasn't as creamy as we expected but the house potatoes with dill sauce made up for that. We will definitely dine here again when visiting Providence.
December 31, 2015|new years evel|2|"Love this restaurant and generally am very pleased. Ordered the tournedos, cooked ""medium"". When served, the meat was well done. The server knew of our problem, but did not offer a new plate. With another couple there, I was not going to get into a problem. We ordered 2 desserts and coffees and they provided those ""on the house"". Certainly, an attempt on their part to recognize their error, but it was a $35 entrée. I would have enjoyed the meal better if the meat was prepared as ordered."
December 31, 2015|New Year's Eve regulars|5|This is our big night to splurge going here for NYE. Food was delicious as always, and Heather was the best server!! The only negative was there was little to no space between tables so getting up and out was a little awkward at times.
December 30, 2015|Fantastic Experience!!|5|we have dined at the Pot quite often over the years. It continues to remain very consistent and even gets better every time. We introduced two new friends to the restaurant to prepare them for our upcoming trip to Paris. A preview of coming attractions so too speak. Bob and family have done a tremendous job and continue to please the pallet and heart. Charlie and Claire were terrific hosts; we shall return very soon!
December 22, 2015|Less than impressive|1|Maybe we ordered the wrong thing? Don't waste your money
December 12, 2015|Wow!|5|Fantastic food and beautiful atmosphere. Gourmet food with generous portions. Personable and attentive servers. A gem!
December 11, 2015|Romantic French Bistro with tasty food.|4|We always enjoy this casual French Bistro. The food is good and the service is very friendly. It's a small cute romantic place with a very French style menu. It's like in in France without the travel!
December 11, 2015|Wonderful Experience|5|We celebrated my wife's birthday with our 21 yo daughter who had never been to Pot au Feu. It had also been a few years since we had been as well. First, it was a very relaxing evening; fairly crowded at times but certainly not overly noisy. We did not once feel as if we were 'hurried' to make our table available. The waitress was very personable and knowledgeable; she gave us plenty of time to make our various decisions. She was helpful to my daughter as she described the different types of sauces my daughter could choose from with her dish. I ordered the Pot au Feu, a traditional french stew that I believe can be made with many different kinds of meats and vegetables - this was served with chicken and beef and both meats were tender and even moreso when you dipped it in a bowl of broth that is part of the dish. All of the vegetables - potatoes, carrots, onions, cabbage and celery - were cooked perfectly so that you could experience each the way it seems as if they were meant to be eaten. With the beautiful understated surroundings, the white tablecloth service, the chef and his assistant, in full view, expertly preparing meals at the entrance to the dining room, one could easily mistake Pot Au Feu as a gem in the middle of rustic and rural France. Dining and dining well, dining as an experiential art, is the aim of Pot au Feu, and what an aim they have. We highly recommend it, especially for couples and families with older adolescents. This is not really the kind of establishment to take young children to.

December 4, 2015|Outstanding French food and service in Providence|5|We dined there with our son on December 4, 2016. We had an amazing meal. The service was superb! I could not have hoped for a better experience. The bartender makes a great French 75!
December 3, 2015|Fabulous Dining Experience|5|Recently, a friend and I dined at Pot au Feu in Providence, RI. From the moment we entered the restaurant until the time we reluctantly left, we had a fabulous time. The service was friendly and professional, each bite of the food was to be savored, and the wine list was extensive. We ordered exactly what we wanted at a cost of $115; but spending that much is not necessary. We will definitely return...soon!
November 28, 2015|Not what I Expected|3|Found the atmosphere at Pot au Feu to be lovely. However, the food was not as good as expected. The price is above average so there were some expectations especially due to the Phantom Gourmet endorsement, etc. The veggies were cold, the portions were fair, the potatoes were charred. My friend's lobster bisque was disappointing. I was underwhelmed and since it was my birthday, I was disappointed for my friend who took me there for the occasion. The server was friendly. The owner stopped by the table to greet us.
November 25, 2015|Great Restaurant|5|The chef prepared excellent food. Service was great too!
November 21, 2015|Fine|3|Our experience was mediocre. The food (vegetarian and fish) was adequate but lacked flavor. The bread was fine but nothing special. The house wine was good, and the creme brulee was excellent (and also huge, enough for two to split and then some). Service was slow but friendly. The room, in a basement, had a nice character to it but was somewhat cramped and loud. The owner was friendly and accommodating, and showed his concern when told that the food was a little disappointing. We may be back to give it another try.
November 21, 2015|Outstanding bistro|4|Excellent French country bistro food, charming setting (exposed brick walls), and friendly, knowledgeable servers.
November 20, 2015|Fantastic gem in the City|5|Fantastic meal and the atmosphere is great too. Will make it a regular spot .

November 10, 2015|What happened?|2|Since it had been several years since my last visit, I was looking forward to dinner this week. Surprised when there was no other diners at what would be prime time. Service staff was courteous and efficient. I feel that the bistro needs updating - get rid of the wine bottle decor. Famous French onion soup was good, and spring green salad was fresh. Entree was a crepe dish, edges burnt black, and over cooked vegetables just didn't feel fresh. Very disappointing. My fellow diners dishes were the same. Pot au Feu needs updating and food quality needs improvement quickly. It almost felt like it needs a Chef Ramsay type intervention. Sorry!
November 7, 2015|Pot au Feu is a typical French Bistro.|4|The duck was delicious - perfectly prepared. The Gravalox were excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and will return. Great Service!
November 7, 2015|Love this place.|5|Cozy, basement bistro feel. Excellent service, the matre'd was the owner the night we went. Even though we arrived late, like many others because of many events in town causing heavy traffic, they treated us a s kindly as ever. The food is very dependable, I've never been disappointed. Very nice wine selection.
November 4, 2015|love this spot|5|We stopped for dinner before the show and so had a limited time. The waiter was very helpful with suggestions of what to order and getting things to us timely. The ambiance is just what I prefer...not fancy, but classy. Also like when you can have a conversation without straining. As for the food here, I love it!
November 3, 2015|Perfection|5|Everything we ordered was excellent...great ingredients perfectly cooked. Excellent service.
Dined on October 24, 2015|Great food & Service|4|Food. Great. Service Stellar. Very loud. And it feels like they've added a few tables to the already tight space since the last time we'd been. We were in the center of room & were continuously bumped, jostled or apologized to by other diners trying to get by. All in all we had a great night & were able to tune this stuff out. But I wish they'd open up the op stairs to give diners more room.
October 24, 2015|Best French restaurant in town.|5|A restaurant full of French atmosphere. The menu is varied with excellent choices. The wine list is not extensive but the selections are excellent. It is tight between the tables as you would expect in a French bistro. You see the chef work and the owner makes rounds to greet every guest. We love this place.
October 22, 2015|A Favorite|5|"This is a wonderful French Bistro in downtown Providence across from the old historic Arcade ""Mall."" It is a hidden gem and has been a culinary masterpiece since the '70's. The French Onion Soup alone is worth going for. It is the BEST you will ever taste! Pot au Feu is a special place."
October 17, 2015|Pot au Feu just as great as it was 30 years ago!|5|I was pleasantly surprised to see that Pot au Feu was still in business. I remember it well from my college days, so I was excited to return and it didn't disappoint. The service was fantastic, the food was great and for a few hours it felt like we had escaped to Paris. So great to be back. Highly recommend!
October 16, 2015|Better Than Ever!|5|Perfect meal from beginning to end! Crepes were so good!
October 10, 2015|Outstanding as always!|5|The service, food, and drinks are always amazing! We have been coming here for years and always come back for our favorite dishes!
October 9, 2015|Disappointed in the duck|3|Took my wife here for a birthday dinner and and everything was as expected except when the duck order came. The sauce was a 5 star, but the duck was over cooked. This was a weekend visit with the owner coming over to the table for a charming conversation. Had someone paid more attention in the kitchen it would have been a wow evening instead of the disappointment it turned out to be.
October 2, 2015|Service/food fair. Don't' go if you are hungry.|3|We have eaten here several times over the past few years and we are disappointed. We had reservations, got there late (called ahead to say we were in traffic) arrived with only 2 other diners but we still sat at our table for over 10 mins before waitress came to take our drink order. We waited for bread to come to the table (had to ask) and we were so hungry that we ate a lot of bread. Bread is fresh but it's almost you have to get out of your chair and yell for someone to bring bread to your table. Service is not rated #1. The salad was poor. Was just a bunch of wilted greens (nothing else but blue cheese) no other veggies. Dinner was just as bad. We both had sole almondine. Wasn't great. The only item that was great was the dessert. We both ordered pot of chocolate (or something like that)
September 26, 2015|Always Great Food|5|Been going here for 25 years and never disappointed. Bob Burke, the owner is an affable Irishman who takes his work and restaurant seriously. The food is comparable to a Parisian bistro and always fresh and tasty. Would definetly recommend. A Providence 5 star eating experience you won't want to miss!
September 12, 2015|Classic French|5|A wonderful classic French bistro setting. Great ambiance, although a little 'cozy'. Expect to find the tables close together. The food and service are both excellent We were greeted warmly and made to feel welcome. Our server was attentive ,knowledgeable about the menu and willing to make suggestions. The food is outstanding. Preparation and presentation was perfect. Sauces were outstanding. The wine list is not extensive, but well chosen. It offers something for every taste and price point. We would definitely recommend, and we will be back.
September 12, 2015|Wonderful bistro|5|Totally enjoyed dinner at this quaint bistro. The ambiance is such that you really feel like you've stepped across the pond into a different country and can totally relax. We had a party of three. Our entrees were the Boeuf a la Bourguignon, the Poulet Romarin et Limon and the Caneton Framboise. Appetizers enjoyed were the Soupe a l'Oignon, the Filet de Saumon Cru & the Soupe du Jour (which was lobster bisque). Everything was prepared perfect, tasted great and the portions very satisfying. Our service was top notch. Will definitely come back.
September 8, 2015|A Superb Dining Experience|5|This is the best restaurant in Providence, not only for French cuisine, but for its service, its ambience and the care taken by the owner, the wait staff and the chef to ensure a superb dining experience. Pot au feu is an international class eating establishment. Mr. Robert Burke is the consummate owner who values the well-being of each customer. His personal attention to diners is as welcome as it is rare.
September 5, 2015|Never disappoints|5|If you love French food or you want to try it, this place cannot disappoint. Keith the chef loves cooking and it shows. Fois gra is awesome!
August 29, 2015|Hmmm|4|I ordered the filet and it was fantastic. Bread right out of the oven with soft butter! My red wine was luscious too
August 29, 2015|Absolutely wonderful!|5|"Pot au Feu is excellent and owner Bob Burke, a superb host. Our pate, steak frites and desserts were all in line with some of our best memories of France. Compliments to the chef. I can see why Julia Childs loved the place. Don't miss her fabulous photo in the stairway: unmistakable grin of surprise, a crepe wrapped on her forearm as she helped prepare 600 such crepes for a book launch...and Bob Burke to add: ""she flipped the crepe right back into the pan and just carried on!"" The restaurant is downstairs, a lively Saint-Germain-like caveau, decorated along the walls with many of the Jeroboham/Mathusaleh Champagne bottles, sabered open by Mr. Burke. We will always go to Pot au Feu when visiting Providence. Merci!"
August 25, 2015|Quaint and Delicious|5|Like being in Paris only in the heart of downtown Providence convenient to Waterfire and more! Great service, great food and great conversation with owner Bob Burke
July 24, 2015|Fabulous find!  Excellent food; great me...|5|Fabulous find! Excellent food; great menu - many choices including standard favorites. Server was friendly and knowledgable, answering our questions with patience and full information about the food and restaurant. She was a pleasure. Pate de maison was delish; salmon cooked perfectly; best bernaise sauce I've ever tasted (and I've tasted a lot!). Overall terrific experience. First visit was for Restaurant Week. Will definitely return - many yummy dishes to try.
June 30, 2015|pot au feu is always an excellent meal|5|Pot au feu offers excellent food and amazing service. Each time we return to this Prividence gem we are treated to the same amazing experience. I recommend it unreservedly!
June 13, 2015|Mediocre|3|We went on a Waterfire night which strains all restaurants but the service was extremely slow. We waited 50 minutes for our entree. The fish in my bouillabaisse was rubbery and tasted old. The bread was stale and didn't taste homemade. Everything except the funky cellar decor was a disappointment.
June 13, 2015|sub par food with outstanding food prices|2|I had the vegetable crepes. The crepes were soggy, rubbery and room temperature. They were filled with overcooked mushy squash and peppers which was the same as the side dish. On top were artichokes, tomatoes and tomatoes that looked and tasted canned. It's summer so fresh vegetables are available..My dining companion had the stuffed chicken which was also room temp. it had almost no flavor and the mouth feel of being boiled. I moved away from RI 17 years ago and at that time this was my favorite restaurant. Either my taste has improved or they've gone way down hill. I have spent twice as much to eat at other restaurants so it's not that I mind spending a lot on food. I just want it to be fresh, flavorful and interesting. I've had better fare at food trucks. It was a waste of time, money and calories.
June 13, 2015|Amazing!!!|4|The food was amazing! A great menu with a lot of variety. With the atmosphere and service you felt like a guest in someone's home. The owner made it a point to check in to see if we were happy. Can't wait to go again!!
June 4, 2015|Fantastic French cuisine.|5|We've never had a bad meal here. The chef de cuisine is fantastic, and the professional wait staff is always fantastic. This is one of our favorite restaurants.
May 23, 2015|French done right!|5|Lovely bistro, excellent service, superb authentic food, delightful owner. No wonder Julia Child loved this place. We had a romantic dinner just after the lighting of Waterfire and then a gondola ride to top off the night. Pot au Feu was a perfect interlude. Couldn't be happier about our experience. So memorable!
May 21, 2015|My favorite dining spot in Providence!  ...|5|My favorite dining spot in Providence! Family owned finest French afire in the area. Wonderful atmosphere for intimate or special occasions.
May 16, 2015|Just like a bistro experience in France|4|As advertised, Pot au Feu is very reminiscent of a bistro in France. Charming and cozy lower level setting, with decor lifted right out of a French setting. Traditional bistro menu choices In every course. Food was well-prepared, very delicious, and reasonably priced. Wine selection was very good as well but overpriced compared to the food.
May 1, 2015|It's going downhill.|3|"We've been to this restaurant many times. Love the small, romantic ""French"" ambiance. But last night, they were out of their lamb dish (and we were there early - 6:30). It was disappointing because 2 of us wanted to order it. And then, the Chardonnay that 2 of us wanted was not chilled. The previous time, all of our meals were overcooked - steak, pork and scallops. Unfortunately, I think we're done with Pot Au Feu. Too bad, as it used to be one of our favorites."
April 21, 2015|The food was very mixy in quality.|3|My expectations of this restuarant was very high. The Escargo, onion soup and creme brulee were fantastic. They need to work on the quality and presentation of the main courses. Also, they did not have a cheese assortment.
April 18, 2015|Pot au feu is bona fide excellent Europe...|5|Pot au feu is bona fide excellent European dining experience right here in Providence. Food, ambience, service and attention to detail are top notch. An added art attraction Is the affable owner's personal attention to his diners. Our very favorite restaurant anywhere. Simply, the best in every way.
April 11, 2015|A  nice experience|4|"Having been to Paris many times, I was impressed with the offerings on the menu. All were very authentic for the most part. Also reminiscent of Paris ambience is the décor of the lower level. Very ""personal"" however, a bit too noisy the night we were there. I was slightly disappointed with the Steaks frites. The steak was not as tender as I was hoping for however enjoyable just the same. Another ""major"" disappointment was that the espresso machine was ""broken"". Being a French/European restaurant, that is something that should ""never"" happen! I was looking forward to a nice finish to a good meal. The Crème Brulee'......EXCELLENT!!!!"

April 9, 2015|We had a good experience.|3|The restaurant was fine, but we were a bit disappointed in our main courses. We had expected fine thin crepes, but these were somewhat thick and doughy. The sole almandine was fine, but hidden under a fairly thick crust.
April 1, 2015|79 Birthday party|5|we had a table of 12 service was great! A rustic feel old stone bluilding with wine bottles as decoration. The food was perfect my Mother had a great time with family! Highly recommend if you want good French food good service!
March 16, 2015|Too cold!|2|"We go to Pot au Feu often but usually not on a Monday evening. It is typically bustling and cozy. This visit was very quiet, which was fine, but it was so cold inside that I had to keep my coat on during the entire dinner. Apparently they hadn't bothered to turn the heat on until we got there! I was VERY disappointed that this special birthday celebration was ruined. I couldn't wait to get out of there just to warm up. The food was wonderful, the waiter was friendly but sounded very ""scripted"" and it seemed clear he couldn't wait for us to leave as well. When we asked for dessert he practically ran to get it and didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea. When I shouted that I wanted coffee, he kept walking away and we had to shout again to add 2 teas! It was only 9:30PM by the time we left so he shouldn't have been too put out that we were ordering dessert."
March 13, 2015|Good sauces|4|Pleasant dinner. Traditional french bistro. Dishes are quite recognizable. Bread was a bit burnt (a surprise). Service not intrusive but also a bit inattentive. Good for a group if you have time to talk. We had a good time and enjoyed dinner. Comfortable. Classic.
March 11, 2015|C'est magnifique|5|From the start, they got the drink right. Very few places in the US make a Kir Royale correctly which is Champagne and Crème de Cassis not Chambord. The fresh bread was continuously coming out of the oven and straight to our table. We sampled the fois gras and two different patés which were rich, creamy, and excellent. The bouillabaisse was superb with more of that fresh hot bread. Love this place and will keep coming back and back and back again.
February 28, 2015|Consistently Great|5|Pot Au Feu has been around a long time but is always great. My parents used to go for date night and now my husband and I love it. Food is always great. Don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Classic french but approachable french....like having dinner in a french home. The lamb melts off the bone and the cassoulet is the ultimate gourment comfort food.. Atmosphere is cozy.
February 21, 2015|Consistency|5|Consistency is what' i look for at this stage of life. The pace of change has surpassed my ability to keep up. But, every once in a while i think about the boeuf bourguignon that i've savored in the past and know that i will find it twenty years after my first taste at Pot au Feu. It was delicious back then and is just as delicious today. Great food, great service, a table visit by the owner, great wine and amazing ambiance. Treat yourself to a great meal.
February 21, 2015|Perfect pre-Philharmonic experience|5|Lovely dinner experience, from the first welcome by Bob Burke, a brief chat at the beautiful Pot au Feu bar, and then on to a delicious dinner with outstanding service. We look forward to a return visit soon.
February 20, 2015|Traditional French bistro food|4|Authentic French bistro food. First time and tested authenticity by ordering traditional onion soup and cassoulet. Both did not disappoint and we would return. Service was pretty good for a busy Friday night. Perfect ambience for a cold winter night as dining room is downstairs and could be dark on a nice summer day. But you come here for the food, first and foremost.
February 14, 2015|Another fine restaurant in city of Providence.|4|My wife and I have been many times and are always pleased with this decision. It is easy to get to, parking lot near by, but most importantly, the food is always delightful. The crepes of the day never disappoint, coupled with warm fresh bread, homemade salad dressings and nice choice of wines always make it a special night.
Dined on February 14, 2015|The Best!|5|Our favorite restaurant for special occasions. The best creme brule in the world!
February 13, 2015|Great traditional French food in candlelit comfort|5|We have come here many times as a couple and with groups. It is quiet, with low-key personal service, white tablecloths, but not too fancy. More like a neighborhood bistro. A Providence gem for many years.
January 17, 2015|Very nice place, the Host was the owner,...|5|Very nice place, the Host was the owner, really nice person, checks on folks over dinner and says thank you for coming on the way out. I had the best French onion soup in my life and the Streak Fritz, cannot wait to go back! Ps the duck was OMG!
January 16, 2015|Great new find for us!|4|Lovely French inspired food. We went on a crowded Friday night, but the food was amazing.
January 16, 2015|Amazing!|5|We went for restaurant week but will be back! Wonderful food and amazing service!
January 15, 2015|Definitely one to try again|5|i was here many year ago and was not impressed with the food (rather heavy, not very current). This time, I was extremely impressed-- it felt more contemporary while still being classic French. Will definitely be coming back. Wine list was awesome.
January 3, 2015|Fine bistro food|5|"Great atmosphere, just enough ""noise"" for energy without pain, fine, sophisticated service, extensive, creative and very French menu, delicious food."
January 3, 2015|Ocassional visitors|4|We arrived on a snowy night, so the restaurant was empty at 6:00 PM. Service was great, food was very good and in spite of the weather others began to venture in beginning at about 6:30. It was an enjoyable evening.
December 31, 2014|The Best!|5|We had a late reservation for New Years Eve! An amazing meal, once again! You just can't get better than Pot Au Feu in RI, or anywhere else... I love the food, service, wine, etc... Simply....The Best!!!
December 30, 2014|Unique and delicious|4|Wonderful spot with a varied menu for a special occasion or out-of-the-ordinary dining. Cassoulet, salad and wine were delicious. Service was attentive, unobtrusive. $$$
December 20, 2014|Antigone (sp?) was an excellent server. ...|5|Antigone (sp?) was an excellent server. So friendly, attentive and knowledgeable on the menu and wines. The duck was great!
December 20, 2014|5 stars|5|As always Pot au Feu was to die for. A perfectly cooked fillet that was worth every penny and the service can't be beat. Already planning my next visit..
December 20, 2014|Best meal of the year !|5|least dinner out at least twice per week and this was my beat meal for 2014. I had been here several years back but had somehow not been back. It is a small French restaurant that is very cozy and comfortable. The service was friendly and attentive and the food was fantastic. I started with the Foie Gras which was has a sauce that even my wife insisted on dunking her bread into. My wife had the tournedos of tenderloin with two different toppings that she raved about. At the recommendation of the waitress i tried the duck which was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Expensive but not outrageous. Well worth the money for a special dinner.The wine list is good but limited and the prices not bad.
December 13, 2014|enjoyable eve.|4|I brought my wife here for her birthday and she thoroughly enjoyed it. The ambiance is nice, it was crowded when when we were there. Service was a bit slow.
December 11, 2014|Excellent Pre-Christmas Feast|5|Once again Pot au Feu outdid itself in service, culinary delights, and style for my party of nine as we gathered to celebrate the close of another academic semester together. From the warmth and hospitality that greeted us, to the attentive care given us by the wait staff, and fantastic feast set before us by the skilled chefs and kitchen we were treated to an evening we will continue to remember. Thank you for making this evening a very special event for us!
December 5, 2014|The service was EXCELLENT!!!  The food w...|5|The service was EXCELLENT!!! The food was DELICIOUS!!! The ambiance is CHARMING!!! This is a restaurant not to be missed if you are in the PVD area!
November 29, 2014|Simply love Pot au Feu!|5|Simply the best service around, with extraordinary French dishes from the traditional to the inventive, always very tasty. Terrific wine selections and an ambiance that is impossible to match. Always recommended for a wonderful experience!
November 29, 2014|Great food but too fast!|4|Arrived at 645pm was seated got a cocktail, soup,salad, main course and my check and was out the door by 745pm. . Food was amazing but way to fast! !!! Wasn't the experience I was looking for that I have received in the past.
November 19, 2014|Food was delicious.|4|Salad greens were fresh and the warm, baked bread is a welcomed way to begin the meal. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Wednesday night, and yet the waiter had to come back to tell us that they didn't have one of their described nightly specials, after my husband had ordered it. This was a disappointment, given that it was their special of the day, and they weren't busy! However, the dishes we received were delicious, and we had a lovely evening.
November 10, 2014|Sbm7|4|The food was awesome. The service and feel for the place immpecapable, we went and were very pleased. The only recamendation I would have for the chef is ease off on the horse radish a little it is a very srong root & if someone is not crazy for it. It can be over beareing. Otherwise your food is suberb!!
November 6, 2014|Lovely French bistro|5|The lamb shank was superb. My husband had the cassoulet du maison, which he loved. And my son had the duck, which was also wonderful. Great service, lovely ambiance. They are not busy on week nights, so a great place to go if you're looking for a quiet evening.
November 1, 2014|Great place.|5|Went here with my girlfriend for a birthday dinner, highly satisfied. Food was amazing, service great, a little pricy but fine for special occasions.
November 1, 2014|Delicious but lonely ...|3|The food & ambiance were outstanding, however; our server never checked on us once we had our plates. The steaks were not cooked as requested, fortunately, we both like rare (had ordered medium rare). We had finished for about 15 minutes before she came by & it took another 10 minutes to get the check. All in all, we had a great time, as we were out without kids & this a lovely little spot. But, I would have liked a little more attention from our server. It seemed they were all overwhelmed. We love the Pot, and this is not a typical experience. I wouldn't call this a bad experience, I'd say a solid B, but I know they are capable of A+++++.
November 1, 2014|Pot au Feu|5|We were celebrating the engagement of a couple and had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was charming and romantic. Even, though it was cold and rainy outside, once we entered the restaurant we were in a different world all of our own. The service was wonderful---our server was a sweetheart and she worked hard to please us. The food was outstanding in all respects. The owner came by to visit and chat and to see how our dinner was going. He also was very friendly, helpful and charming. That gesture was much appreciated. We were able to linger for as long as we wished; there was no hint for us to finish and leave. Yes it was somewhat expensive to dine here, but even though we traveled from NY we would definitely love to come here again.
October 25, 2014|so glad to have found this place!|4|First time dining here,great food we felt like we were transported to Marseille and that Julia Child was present
October 18, 2014|Lovely Time|5|Very accommodating staff and friendly host. Food was very good and the ambience reminded me of Toulouse!
October 18, 2014|Pot au Feu is fabulous|5|My recent dinner at the Pot au Feu was wonderful. I have dined there many times over the past 20 years and have always been very pleased. The food is excellent and consistent. The service was terrific. We had to get to a performance so time was important. Service was staged so that we had enough time for dessert without feeling at all rushed. The owner personally visits the tables.
October 11, 2014|two for two|5|This was our second visit, and once again it was just wonderful. Love the atmosphere. Service was attentive, and professional, but not at all stuffy. The appetizers and entries were perfectly delicious. We will come back and definitely bring friends that enjoy special food.
October 11, 2014|Lovely as always|4|Pot au Feu is a providence institution. Under Bob Burke's, Pot au Feu provides fabualous French food in an italian dominated restaurant scene.
October 11, 2014| Nice atmosphere.|4|My husband and I had a lovely time. Soups were good, meals were ok. service was spot on and the ambiance was perfect.
October 11, 2014|Mom & Daughter|5|Loved the food, wait staff and general atmosphere. Perfect for an personal dinner with my daughter. Might be even better for a romantic twosome.
October 3, 2014|wonderful food wonderful experience|5|Very comfortable environment. The owner came around to each table to make sure you were enjoying yourself. Our waitress couldnt have been sweeter! The food.....outstanding. Real authentic french cooking. Perfect for a fall winter meal.
September 20, 2014|C'est delicieux!|5|This is our second time to Pot au Feu and it didn't disappoint! We will definitely go back in the future since there's daily specials for crepes, soup, appetizers and entrees. Their chicken live mousse is buttery and savory and their French onion (l'oignon) soup is probably the best I've ever tasted. I got the Steak et frites, my husband the Duck with framboise sauce and a friend got the Boeuf Bourginon - all received rave reviews. Wine is a little overpriced but that's usually the case with any fine dining restaurant but a wonderful selection, I had the GSM which was lovely.
September 20, 2014|Fine bistro food|4|Pot au Feu has been a consistently fine bistro for more than 20 years. It remains delightful, with excellent food, its good menu always enhanced by interesting specials. It is in an area of Providence that is redolent with the history of the city in the most charming way. Absolutely lovely.
September 12, 2014|Not what it used to be|3|"Wanted to celebrate a special occasion with some friends who had never been there before. The menu selection was very nice. The service was ""dis-jointed""...due to a private party upstairs. We ordered 3 soups for an appetizer and only 2 were brought out...our server had time to help two other patrons take numerous pictures of themselves... All salads were served with blue cheese when one should have been without. The entrées were good, however the potatoes served with the dill were rather over - cooked and the dill ""sauce"" was nothing special. Again, for the price of the entrée, everything should have been prepared to order. Will pay the price for fresh quality. Not many people there - should have been a clue! We won't be back."
September 5, 2014|"A great Providence dining ""must""!"|5|Great food, wine, service, ambiance & overall dining experience!!
August 30, 2014|Outstanding.|5|The best value for fine dining I have ever experienced. Each bite was like a symphony of superior taste and indulgence.
August 25, 2014|Pot au Feu|5|Having been Pot au Feu before my wife and I chose this restaurant for our wedding anniversary. We truly enjoy the atmosphere and superb service and food. We have dined here before in larger parties and just by ourselves and have never been disappointed. We look forward to dinning at Pot au Feu again!
July 26, 2014|Pot auFeu is a top-notch authentic Frenc...|5|Pot auFeu is a top-notch authentic French Bistro .Not only is the menu appropriate,intriguing and descriptive but the open kitchen is evocative of France, that is, miraculous food created by a chef who gets fabulous results in a small kitchen. The granite and brick walls add to the decor .It is remarkable.We arrived early to have cocktails at the bar and had the good luck to find the owner himself filling in while the bartender on duty was picking up food for bar-dining patrons.The owner spent considerable time with us there and in the dining room.-a delightful touch along with our lovely French server who was wonderful. The wine list is as impressive. Leave room for dessert. Awesome Creme Brulet and Pot au Chocolate-Intense.
July 26, 2014|START TO A GREAT NIGHT|5|great food and great service love that place. THE FOOD WAS PERFECT, GREAT COOKS,
Dined on July 19, 2014|Paris in Providence|5|My wife and I have been dining at Pot au Feu for over ten years. The food is consistently excellent authentic French cuisine, they have a nice wine list, and very attentive service. Poulet Farci du Jour, Boeuf Bourguignon and the Saumon Citron are all great choices. The overall experience is about as close as you can get to an authentic French bistro here in Providence!
July 19, 2014|Would def recommend|4|Loved the menu. Food was excellent! Clean. Open kitchen. Love that!!! Small and quaint yet roomy enough to feel as though your not on top of your neighbor. Had the steak fritas and chocolate crepe! Both very good!
July 18, 2014|Very pleasant surprise|5|"We went to Pot au Feu during restaurant week. I've heard mixed things about it so I figured that with their prices (a bit on the expensive side) restaurant week is a great way to try it out. The food was outstanding for the most part. The salad is ""meh"" - just a handful of greens and they give you the dressing on the side. However, the soup and the entrees were phenomenal. We got the steak au poivre and the salmon which wasn't on the restaurant week menu but they were out of sole so they substituted. The citrus mousse was very nice as well. The fruit crepe was a bit too chewy but was overall ok. The ambience is great, typical French. The music was lovely and it's just a very nice restaurant for an intimate date or a special occasion."

July 9, 2014|Riding on their Reputation?|3|Julia Childs raved about Pot au Feu when she was alive. I have had a couple of outstanding meals there, but this wasn't one of them. My Pate Maison was superb. My companion's carrot ginger soup was too thick, and garnished with stringy bits of leek that were like straw -- inedible. Our Steak Frites were difficult to cut -- not sure if it was the cut of meat (unidentifiable) or the steak knives. Frites were excellent, but a French restaurant SHOULD be able to do a decent French fry! Dessert was an OK, very firm chocolate concoction with old whipped cream on top, served in a small coffee cup. We ordered from their prix fixe menu, since this was Restaurant Week in Providence. They were out of one of the items on the menu!
July 7, 2014|The staff couldn't be nicer.  They knew ...|5|The staff couldn't be nicer. They knew their food and wine and made excellent recommendations. Food came to the table hot, appealing and it was delicious. I will go back to try other food choices that I couldn't try on this visit.
July 5, 2014|Excellent dining experience|5|We went to Pot au Feu to celebrate birthdays for 2 people in the group. The food was excellent and our waitress added to the experience (excellent recommendations for wines and desserts). An added bonus is that we were able to talk to each other without yelling over the background noise. There was lovely jazz/French music, but it was kept quite low and didn't interfere with conversations. We will definitely make plans to return.

June 27, 2014|Not Quite Perfect|4|The very best aspect my dinner was the waiting staff. Don't misunderstand, the food was very good--especially the Coquille and the lemon mouse. Vegetable were also nicely done. All in all, a very good meal.
June 7, 2014|Great dining experience.|5|Food was amazing. Really impressed that owner took the time to visit our table to find out if we had a pleasant dining experience. You never see that anymore. Waitress extremely knowledgeable regarding food and wine. Our special occasion will be a memorable one.
June 3, 2014|My fiance and I ate at Pot a Feu for his...|5|My fiance and I ate at Pot a Feu for his birthday. The restaurant itself is beautiful, the table set up was very romantic and intimate. The server was absolutely wonderful and gracious, and the food was amazing! The only downfall was noise level, but this was only because after 15 minutes of us being the only party (Tues at 7pm) a group of 7 or so came in who was a bit loud but of course that's out of the restaurants control. I especially loved the specials from France section of the menu. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!
May 30, 2014|30 Years of history with Pot au Feu|4|"My wife and I both started coming here with other partners years ago, and were delighted to find out that each other loved the restaurant. It is one of our ""Special"" night out spots. If you love French Cuisine and a small romantic place is of your liking.. Pot au Feu. This visit makes at least our 40th visit between us in the last 30 years. We both had the same thing to eat. Snail appetizer was not as impressive as usual, a bit bland. Beef Bourguignon was wonderful, perfectly cooked and flavorful. The bread which is served in a basket to all tables as it comes out of the oven is so delicious. Our server Madeline was the best wait staff we have ever had at this restaurant. She was lovely, witty, engaging and attentive."
May 16, 2014|Great Romantic Spot|5|I had booked a reservation for my boyfriends' birthday and it was perfect. we were seated right away and the food and wine were amazing. We stared with the escargot because well, wen in France. It was deliciously buttery and not overwhelmingly garlicky. I had the duck which was probably one of the best things I've ever eyes, while my boyfriend got the perfectly cooked salmon. for dessert we got the chocolate crepe. Overall the wait staff was very pleasant. The only issue, which really want that terrible, was the parking. we didn't have any cash so we had to go to the garage and use out credit cards. Overall a fantastic experience.
May 6, 2014|Excellent pre-show restaurant |5|I ate dinner here before a show at the PPAC. Our waitress asked if we had plans and accommodated our schedule to ensure we could enjoy our dinner and not be late. The food was excellent - we ordered the boulabaise and stuffed chicken of the day (which was brie and pear). I would definitely come back here next time I'm seeing a show in the area.
May 6, 2014|classic French|4|Pot au Feu offers a slice of France right in the middle of Providence. The menu features a crepe of the day, along with a daily quiche and also other French specialties like Pot au Feu, or Steak Frites. Our meal came with a fresh green salad with mustard vinaigrette which was fresh and tangy and my entree, Coquille St Jacques, featured beautifully cooked large scallops and a few equally large shrimp bathed on a lovely cream sauce. Alongside this was fresh asparagus and potatoes . Overall a nice sized serving, nice presentation, good service and an excellent opportunity to visit France right in New England.
May 2, 2014|always before a show|4|e have been eatingnat pot au feu fo over 20 years. We always gobefore a show at thr P P A C the food is alwys excellent ad a any frenh restaurant a very good wine list. its an epensive dinner but you do get what you pay for

April 19, 2014|Good food, too pricey|4|The food was delicious, but certainly not worth the price. Any meal we had should have topped off in the mid $20 range. Overpriced much like a designer label.
April 12, 2014|Disappointed|3|I have been to this restaurant several times in past years. My favorite dish has always been the onion soup. It seems to be different now. It is not as good as it has been in the past. It is no longer the supreme standard. I was there as a party of three. The entrees were very good, but, as like the soup, they were not blow you away good, certainly not worthy of the outrageous prices. Honestly, I have had equally good, and better, entrees at other restaurants that cost a lot less. The service was great, however, the food did not justify the cost. I regret that I will not be going back.
April 10, 2014|Good, but used to be better.|3|The menu selections are very interesting, distinctly traditional French dishes. But the quality isn't quite what it used to be. The salad greens were limp (and less interesting than previously); the duck a l'orange sauce was unusually thick and sticky; the cassoulet was dried out; but the lamb shank was delicious, tender and succulent, and the blue fish pate appetizer was excellent; also, the wine-by-the-glass selections were very good. Service was fairly good, but we didn't receive exactly what we ordered (wrong potatoes). The bread was fresh and warm and we were frequently offered more! The desserts were quite good. Ambience, lamb, and wine were the best part. We'll go back, but no longer the old favorite.
April 5, 2014|Cozy atmosphere, attentive service|5|Had dinner here the first time with a friend on Saturday night. I really liked the cozy atmosphere. I'd never eaten at a true French restaurant before so I was a little unsure if I would like it, but the menu had plenty of options. The food was excellent and the servers attentive and friendly. You should plan to have a leisurely evening (in the European style) as the entree took quite a while, but it was so comfortable we hardly noticed. I'd recommend it to anyone, even if you don't know whether you like French food.
April 5, 2014|A definite when looking for|5|A definite when looking for a special place to enjoy a great night out. The atmosphere couldn't be friendlier and the uniqueness of the menu and quality is outstanding. All the little things are done well....Highly recommend
April 5, 2014|Fantastic french food|4|Overall we had a lovely experience here and french food is very very good! This was my second time back.
April 5, 2014|Good food, great ambiance,|4|Good food, great ambiance, great little bar, absolutely exceptional service.
March 26, 2014|love this place for its cozy|3|"love this place for its cozy romantic atmosphere and usually good food...was a little disappointed this time though. One of us had the duck which was delicious...it came with a choice of French fries, couscous or potato...I opted for couscous and was so surprised to see a thimble full on the plate along with 4 pieces of vegetables...couscous isn't that expensive and for an over 30 dollar meal, there should have been more on the plate along with a few more vegetables. we also had the ""special"" which was a white bean,duck, pork dish and the waiter kept telling me it was a lot of white beans, which I like. unfortunately it was MOSTLY bread crumbs in butter. so disappointing, again, over 30. for the meal."
March 21, 2014|Special|4|This was our second dining experience @ Pot au Feu. This time was to celebrate our 27yr wedding anniversary. We wanted a special dining experience and we got it. The food was expertly prepared. I had the Marceilles mixed seafood platter and my wife a stuffed chicken breast entree. We have a particular disdain for restaurant food which is overly salty. Pot au Feu did not dissappoint there. My only gripe was that I felt the glass of win we ordered with dinner was a bit short on quantity- though the chardonnay was excellent.
March 15, 2014|Delightful French bistro|4|We had a delightful dinner Saturday night at Pot au Feu. The dinner entree we selected were tasty and well presented. The escargot was too rich for me though. The restaurant ambience was inviting. The service was attentive and friendly. It was nice of the owner to greet and chat with the diners at each table. A wonderful place for special ccasions. we will be sure to recommend the restaurant to our friends and hope to return.
March 8, 2014|Quaint French|5|This place is fantastic! Food was phenomenal, service attentive and atmosphere was perfect. Only negative was the enthusiastic 4-top at the next table. The owner came by every table and we had a great conversation. Will definitely be coming back
February 25, 2014|Pot au feu & a film festival|5|A friend from Providence who attended a summer camp with my brother thirty years ago and I met at Pot au Feu. I had come up from Connecticut to attend the Providence French festival at the near-by Cable Car Cinema. In spite of limited time, Pot au feu served us a delightful meal and got us out in time for the film, Queen of Montreuil. The crepes were very good, my duck was the best I have ever had, superb! But our experience with Pot-au-feu was not over. In delight at the dinner I managed to leave the restaurant without my winter cap and gloves. The following day I emailed the owner, who set the articles aside and handed them back to me the following Saturday.
February 22, 2014|Nice atmosphere and delicious food|4|Very nice atmosphere and delicious entrees. The appetizers were excellent. The owner was very attentive.
February 22, 2014|Great experience!|5|Excellent food, and attentive unpretentious service.
February 21, 2014|A Wonderful Evening|4|I surprised my girlfriend with a trip to this lovely restaurant as a belated Valentine's Day dinner. The staff was kind and attentive to us, even with a small rowdy group next to us, providing bread when it ran low and keeping our glasses full. The food was fantastic, definitely worth a return visit. Definitely made up for me being unable to celebrate on actual Valentine's Day.
February 15, 2014|Wonderful place and consistent|5|We've been going to Pot au Feu across its many iterations over the years, and have always loved it. The ambiance - in a tastefully designed space complete with wine bottles everywhere - makes it feel very much like eating in a bistro in France. And the food follows suit, tasting just like Savoyard cuisine across the pond.
February 14, 2014|Still outstanding!|4|A basement bistro with a long history of fine management and wonderful food continues to be a real treat. A must for all lovers of fine fun food.
February 14, 2014|A Perfect night out!|5|My girlfriend and I went on Valentine's Day last week and the experience was nothing shy of perfect. The food was great, the service was good and the restaurant was wonderful. The hostess was very polite when we had called saying we were going to be 25 minutes late for our reservation due to traffic on Atwells. The hostess assured us it was no problem and directed us through Providence on a quicker route. We arrived and the noisy but quaint dining room was filled to the brim with Valentine's Day reservations. We were sat immediately and every was great from there on out.
February 14, 2014|Oh well|2|We booked this restaurant for Valentine's Day which maybe the reason we had a bad experience. The restaurant promotes that it is the oldest French Bristro but there are now a number of excellent French restaurants in Providence, this I did not think was one of them. The menu seems dated and more suited to American's who are unfamiliar with French cuisine. The blue fish pate was tasty but the hard bread unnecessary to go with it. The filet was ordered medium but came rare. The mushroom demi glace was too heavy and more like a gravy, the broccoli rabe had a funny taste. My date ordered the swordfish which was a small thin piece and looked a bit over done but he said it was fine. The dill potatoes were hunks of deep fried potato.
February 14, 2014|Getting Close on Valentine's|4|We went to the restaurant on Valentine's Day, which is also our anniversary. We have been there a many of times and knew what to expect. It was obvious that extra tables had been placed in the restaurant to handle the demand and it was packed. We were placed at a little table set off from the entrance by a folding screen and right in the aisle which put us off a bit, but, surprisingly, no one bumped into us once. You could feel the draft from the door and it was a bit noisy. Beyond that, everything was exactly as we had expected. The food was amazing and the service was more than adequate considering the crowd. To top it all off, Mr. Burke filled a special meal request for my wife, a dish they have not served at the restaurant in years.
February 14, 2014|Valentine's Night|5|Fabulous night at Pot Au Feu! Food was out of this world and it was a very romantic setting to spend with the love of my life! The staff was great. The evening ended with creme brûlée that was to die for!
February 14, 2014|very,very good|4|I don't give outstanding ratings very often but Pot au Feu was very, very good on Valentine's Evening. The duck was very large, tasty, and expertly made. My wife's crepes stuffed with chicken, spinach, and mushrooms were also yummy. The place had the feel of a real Bistro with mostly tables for couples. I suppose that was because it was Valentine's Eve. The wine selection was substantial and we enjoyed a robust B & G Chateauneuf du Pape. Altogether, it was a lovely evening.
February 12, 2014|Pre valentine|5|Enjoyable meal. We patronize pot au feu occasionally, would go more often if it were not so pricey. We like to linger and enjoy multiple courses...like in France. Only criticism, my boeuf bourgonone had no vegetables. No carrots or onions...and no mushrooms...unlike in France.
Dined on February 11, 2014|Excellent Dinner|5|We went with two other couples and had an excellent time. The food is outstanding and the comfortable cozy setting makes for a great evening. This consistently provides great food. Can't wait until our next visit!!!
February 8, 2014|Cold evening in Providence.|4|What could be a more perfect way to warm yourself up after a cold week than the have a hearty but delicate meal at a fine restaurant in a romantic atmosphere? Pot au Feu is the perfect answer to this. We stumbled upon it quite by accident but would highly recommend it to any one. I was concerned about other people saying the device was slow but we weren't in a hurry so made the booking anyway. Our service was excellent. No one tried to hurry us but our food arrived in a timely manner. The wine list is excellent. Lots of interesting choices and the server was very knowledgable about the wine list which is all too rare.
January 30, 2014|slow|2|We had an early reservation before the theatre in an empty restaurant - not sure how it took almost two hours and we still had to hurry the waitress for the check.
January 30, 2014|This is my second time at|2|This is my second time at pot au feu. If this review were purely based on food it would get much better ratings because honestly the food has been great both times! The escargot was great as was the quiche special and the stuffed chicken. I have yet to have any room for dessert because I usually finish everything on my plate! This is part though because the wait is so long!! It took an hour and half to get entrees on a very dead week night. The service overall is appalling, and this is not just a waitstaff review because our server was lovely. But Pot au Feu seems like a place which could care less if it were a restaurant. It gives you the feel of an intrusive house guest that they are hoping not to impress too much so you won't return
January 18, 2014|Neighborhood Gem|4|When one thinks of eating out in Providence, this place is almost one of the last, since PVD has a plethora of Italian restaurants. We decided to check out this place on a snowy Saturday and we had a wonderful time! The servers were great and attentive. The host came by a few times to check on us! The food was great and reasonably priced. The only complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cramped and loud, but I think that adds to the charming factor of French restaurants.
January 17, 2014|Always great|5|I always love going back to Pot Au Feu. Any place that was a favorite of Julia Child has to be good, right? It always is. The owner is always present. The service is always great. The food is always fantastic. One of my favorites as well!
January 17, 2014|One of our favorites.|4|My wife and I enjoy our nights out for dinner on the weekends and Pot au Feu never disappoints. The service is attentive and friendly, the food is classic French, and always excellent. The owner is always there and drops by the table to chat and make sure all is well. I love the sunk-in lower level with the brick walls and soft lighting, it's a very comfortable dining environment. We will be back soon enough, and we can't wait.
January 9, 2014|Delish|4|Dined with two friends for Restaurant Week. We enjoyed our food very much. One person in the party has a food allergy, which the server was happy to assist with/accommodate as needed. Will definitely return! Just a note, though, that this restaurant is slow-paced with courses, so it won't be a place where you can get in and out quickly! However, if you have the time, the food is worth the wait!
January 7, 2014|Great food, a little slow|4|Everything was wonderful. We were a group of 6 and the only issue was that dinner took us three hours.
January 3, 2014|some items we have had in|4|some items we have had in the past were no longer gluten-free, so that was a slight disappointment. But overall, still a restaurant we love. the food we did get was great as always. Will continue to recommend Pot au Feu for sure. But hope they go back to using corn starch or something else gluten free in the sauces.
December 31, 2013|Very nice restaurant.Tables|4|Very nice restaurant.Tables way to close to each other...
December 31, 2013|NYE|5|Perfect place for new years eve dinner! Super wine list, and coffee listing. My son and I enjoyed delicious entrees and desserts that were served by superior servers, who made it extra special!
December 31, 2013|Romantic|5|Beautiful romantic little bistro with amazing food!
December 30, 2013|Romantic Dining|5|First timers but will definitely return. Food and service was outstanding. Dining room was very intimate but slightly cold.
December 28, 2013|Excellent Seafood and Service|5|The food was excellent. We both had the French onion soup to start. It was seasoned perfectly and was served at the perfect temperature. The scrod and swordfish were both cooked to perfection. The swordfish is the best that I have had to date. It was not dry, but it was cooked all the way through so it was not mushy in the center. We had the Pot au Chocolate for dessert. It was very rich. Two people could share one if you are just looking for something sweet after your meal. The service was impeccable. We never had an empty water glass or wine glass (until we chose to). Freshly baked, hot bread is served and the waitress delivers it to the table piece by piece as soon as you finish the piece you have. I will return.
December 21, 2013|Fantastic evening.|5|Fiancee had been here with her mom as a child and requested we go. I held off for about a year, but finally gave in. From the second you walk it you note that it's a welcoming atmosphere, the Owner introduced himself and wished us a happy evening. Besides all the small stuff... the food was wonderful. The french onion soup was real good. Blue fish pate' was real real good. Entrees were perfect and desert was the cherry on top (literally). I wouldn't recommend for a casual dinner, but if you are comfortable with treating yourself and spending between 70-150 bucks depending on getting wine,desert, apps... please go. You will not be disappointed.
December 7, 2013|Always a treat|5|Reliablely creative and always well prepared and presented dishes. Quality is apparent and friendly & capable staff. Classic.
December 6, 2013|good food, bad service|2|The restaurant was beautiful and most of the food was good. I loved the carrot and ginger soup of the day, my beef burgundy was a little dry. The restaurant was half empty when we arrived and there were what seemed to be an adequate number of staff to accommodate the restaurant at full capacity. I am still not sure who our waiter actually was. After we were seated it took over 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink order, we were ready to order our dinner at that point, but the waitress said that she would put the drink order in and be right back. She was gone for over 10 minutes. We could see other people being served and checked on frequently. The restaurant was not busy. It felt like we were put in a corner and forgotten.
December 6, 2013|Wonderful dining experience|5|Pre-theatre dinner. Food was exceptional. Innovative specials by the chef. Staff extremely attentive. An overall wonderful dining experience.
December 6, 2013|FRENCH IN PVD|5|"Every once in a while you need to do something other than fish, steak, Italian in Providence. Hard to find traditional French but the Pot has it in a cute, south of France atmosphere. They Evan had a (Cassolet) which I had never even heard of until trying it in Provence. We had a wonderful, before theatre, dinner, a nice bottle of wine and a short, though rainy, walk to PPAC. The owner came over to talk and his take on the city is interesting. I like the bar for a quiet glass of wine on a winter's day. There are only a few seats and it's probably meant as a waiting area but it's very welcoming and the giant map of Parisbrings back ond memories of past travels. Yes, we were happy with. ""The Pot"" and recomend it to others."
December 5, 2013|Seriously?|2|Food was overpriced! Portions were tiny but the prices were huge. The service was good. For the prices they expect you to pay, I would have at least expected to sit in a comfortable booth or chair. The tables and chairs was super old, right out of my grandmother's kitchen. The owner came around 3 times while we were there and only went to two different tables of obvious friends that he knew. At the time we were eating there were only 5 tables being served. I would have expected him to hit each table? I can honestly say I would probably not go back.
December 4, 2013|Pot au Feu-forgot how nice it was|5|Hadn't been here it quite some time. Made reservations prior to a show. Wait staff very aware of our timeline and did everything to make the experience wonderful but have us out in time for the show. Forgot how good the food was, I had the duck and wife had the lamb shank. Will come back !!
December 4, 2013|Great as usual. The perfect|4|Great as usual. The perfect place for dinner before theater in Providence.
November 30, 2013|Special|5|Pot au Feu has a warm, welcoming atmosphere; the food is delicious and comes in generous portions; and the staff is knowledgable, polite and upbeat.
November 30, 2013|An experience|5|As always, the food is simply outstanding. The meal is made all the more enjoyable by the intimate atmosphere, the good wines, and the professional wait-staff.
November 29, 2013|Always a treat!|5|We love this place! It reminds us of restaurants we see in Europe - small, wonderful ambiance! Food and service are consistently great. Type of place you can dress up for a special occasion, or go casual. Next time we'll eat at the bar - looks like fun! Just a couple of blocks from Performing Arts Center and Johnson & Wales. Creme brûlée is to die for!!
November 16, 2013|Will NOT Go Again|2|The food was ok at best. Could have been better experience if the server that sat us had given us a more appropriate table for a couple. Would not recommend to a guy looking for a romantic dinner or someone looking for really good french food. If you are staying in the area and not really that particular and decide to give it a try...INSIST you don't get table 49. Take care.
November 16, 2013|A lovely French gem in Providence|5|We had an early dinner reservation on Saturday night at 6 PM. We got there early - just after 5:30 PM and got seated right away in the Bistro downstairs. Our server was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and the specials being offered for dinner. Everything was wonderful, including the California bubbly that we ordered by Chandon. We had the daily cassoulet dish with white beans, chicken and two kinds of spicy sausage, and one order of steak frites. The creme brulee and the chocolate dessert in the champagne flute were to die for - the perfect ending to a marvelous meal and experience. If you want to have a leisurely dinner with great food, wine and dessert, go to Pot au Feu in Providence, RI
November 12, 2013|Great Place to Celebrate|5|We recently flew to Providence Ri to get married. As French food is my Partner's favorite, we decided on Pot au Feu. WOW. What a great choice. It was intimate, romantic and the food was fabulous. The service was top notch. My Partner had the Steak Fritte' and I had the Salmon Citrone. Both were the best we've had. The owner stopped by the table and we had a nice conversation. What a great experience. It's no wonder this restaurant has been around 41 yrs and was one of Julia Childs' favorite. We can't wait to come back to Providence and of course come back to Pot au Feu.
October 26, 2013|My daughter, who studied in|4|My daughter, who studied in France for 4 months, loved the dinner at this small and yet authentic French restaurant.
October 26, 2013|Perfect Little Piece of Heaven|4|My fiancee and I went there hoping for a romantic evening and good food. This place is so much more. The atmosphere is charming and quaint. We both ordered a glass of merlot and went with the waitresses suggestion. The wine was subtle and not overpowering. I ordered a steak (filet) it was so tender and flavorful. My fiancee ordered the crepe florentine which was stuffed with chicken and spinach. We will definitely be back and hopefully get the same table. I loved watching the chef in the doing a very difficult balancing act.
October 19, 2013|Waitress with an attitude|3|Visited this restaurant with my adult son and my boyfriend late on a Saturday evening. Very cozy atmosphere and food was tasty though overpriced Our waitress made a point of asking each of us if we wanted blue cheese crumbles along with our salads. My boyfriend said yes but didn't get any. When she came back to the table after we finished our salads, I informed her. She proceeded to sarcastically state that she would make sure to take the extra $1. charge off the bill. When she finally delivered the bill at the end of the meal she again made a sarcastic point of having removed the $1. charge. The whole time she was looking and smiling at my boyfriend and avoiding eye contact with me, trying to make it seem like I was being a cheapskate!
October 19, 2013|My all-time favorite!|5|Pot au Feu has been my all-time FAVORITE restaurant for over 20 years!! The food cannot be beat. Amazing!!
October 19, 2013|great!|5|Husband and I loved it! Great food, great waitress, darling little place!
October 18, 2013|Very French|4|Solid French food: bouillabaisse Marseilaise, pot au feu, steak frites--all done well. Salad with, marvelous dressings, Raspberry Balsamic Vinaigrette or Housemade Mustard Vinaigrette. Huge crock of superb onion soup. Cafe au lait, choclate mousse and crepe with orange sauce (which turned out to be berry sauce -- menu not updated) were perfect ending. Service the tops, no rush, everything spaced out with time to enjoy and savor and gab, decor, rest rooms, pleasant surprises. Pricey but worth it.
October 5, 2013|Julia child was here|4|Incredible French restaurant in an Italian restaurant town. Great foie gras, amazing!!!
October 5, 2013|This restaurant was very good|5|This restaurant was very good from honoring a seating request to service to dessert. You don't find many restaurants that give you a complete meal anymore that includes salad, potato and vegetable. Even though it may be small, it enhances the ambience of the restaurant. The swordfish was absolutely cooked to perfection but the best part was the creme brulee. You may be a little shocked at the price of $12 but believe me two people can eat this because it comes in a soup dish not a ramekin that most brulees come in. I would definitely go back to this restaurant again and highly recommend it.
October 5, 2013|We were late for our reservation|4|We were late for our reservation due to lack of taxi, but they were very understanding about it and they held our table. Great service, great food, 2 minute walk to Waterfire.......
September 30, 2013|Great food, service, and ambience|5|Enjoyed every aspect of our experience here. We cannot wait to return.
September 25, 2013|Knockout|5|The service and the atmosphere made for an amazing experience. My first time in Pot au Feu was above average but my second visit was superb. We will be back!
Dined on September 14, 2013|Nice ambiance, disapointing food|3|We were very charmed upon arrival, lovely French ambiance. However none of the food lived up to even moderate french food. Stating with the bread, definitely NOT French, more like soft Italian. The Salad was just OK. We had crepes, quite and the bouillabaisse. The Bouillabaisse was the best of the orders, good, not outstanding.The Crepes were dry and and quiche was curdled. Sorry, but we won't go back. The staff was courteous and attentive. So in a nutshell the place was nice, the food a disappointment.
September 13, 2013|Fine but....|3|prices are high for the quality, this restaurant is riding on it's reputation. Food is good but not spectacular.
September 12, 2013|temperature was warm inside,|4|temperature was warm inside, but the food was great.
August 24, 2013|This restaurant is a great place for an ...|5|This restaurant is a great place for an unforgettable dinner on a special occasion. Rather, it makes any occasion special. My coquilles was unbelievable, and the chicken specials are out of this world. I never dreamed a chicken breast could be so delicious. The owner always says hello, and the first time I went, he shared wonderful stories of a visit to Florence. You cannot go wrong here if you like French food. I can't wait to go back.
August 10, 2013|Excellent food as always.|5|Excellent food as always. French food in a relaxed bistro setting. It's a consistently excellent Providence restaurant.
August 3, 2013|This is a gem of a French|5|This is a gem of a French Bistro as it is truly authentic in its ambiance and menu. All dishes are executed at the moment and to perfection, and the service is friendly, attentive, and polite. Excellent wine list.
July 27, 2013|Annual treat|5|We have two July birthdays in our immediate family and began celebrating them at Pot au Feu years ago. It's a great family tradition that we wouldn't miss. Terrific food, service and atmosphere.
July 26, 2013|Fun Date Night|4|Went to dinner, walked around for dessert and a movie at cable car. Good night!
July 25, 2013|My favorite|5|Pot au Feu has long been my favorite Providence restaurant. Everything about the experience is first class, including its terrific owner, Bob Burke.
July 20, 2013|Delicious romantic dinner|5|Cozy intimate setting, impeccable service, delicious food. We had a wonderful evening at Pot Au Feu. We especially loved the citrus salmon, bluefish pate, crispy dill white and sweet potatoes and chocolate creme dessert. Can't wait to go back.
July 20, 2013|Rustic, good food&excellent service|4|"I liked the rustic feel of this space. It was earthy with stone walls and brick floor and low lighting and a view of the kitchen/chef. Service was wonderful, attended to every need and request. Food was very good, french fries, i.e., ""frites françaises"" outstanding. Had an enjoyable meal in a comfortable environment."
July 19, 2013|spectacular foie gras and|5|spectacular foie gras and coquille st. jacques with scallops and shrimp
July 13, 2013|Just Wonderful!|5|Made Reservations here for a Romantic Evening which included Providence's Waterfire. A Great Staff, Food and Ambiance to start Our Date and Wonderful Evening together. Thanks to All at the Pot Au Feu!!
July 9, 2013|lovely restaurant. great ambiance--|4|lovely restaurant. great ambiance--very romantic. i was very pleased that they were willing to offer me a vegan entree even though it was not officially on the restaurant week menu.
July 9, 2013|Excellent food, but the service|4|Excellent food, but the service was quite slow. Not sure if this was because of restaurant week, but for the prices, an second waitress would help.
July 8, 2013|Went for Providence Restaurant|5|Went for Providence Restaurant Week and got a 3-course prix fixe meal. I got the chicken pate, savory crepes stuffed with beef, and the pot de chocolate au creme for desert. She got the smoked bluefin pate, salmon, and dessert crepes. The food and service was outstanding, great place for a nice night out.
July 5, 2013|An unmemorable meal :(|4|The service and the ambience were very nice. Our waitress helpful in the wine selection. It was fun to watch the Chef in his one-man kitchen. My husband enjoyed his meal, but was not wowed. My chicken was overdone making it dry and a disappointment. Since we were from out-of-town and traveling we were looking forward to having the doggie bag for a snack, but I guess they did not have small takeout containers for liquids, because my husband's was missing the essential au jus. My husband did mention that if we would return to Providence in the future he would not plan to return to this restaurant.
July 2, 2013|A truly gem|5|My first visit to Providence and decided to try Pot au Feu. What a good decision. The main course, with the restaurant name, was simply delicious. Our waiter was attentive and always trying to please. I will go back
July 1, 2013|Simply amazing.|5|One of Julia Child favorite restaurant in RI. Amazing French food. See you soon again.
June 27, 2013|classic|4|Classic French Bistro...warm, inviting. Wonderful owner and host, Bob Burke who oversees professional but friendly and knowledgeable staff. Delicious food...done right every time.
June 20, 2013|One of the restaurants that|4|One of the restaurants that is in the rotation when we go out in Providence. Always good food and good service. Easy to park for the restaurant when attending a show at PPAC.
June 15, 2013|A great French Restaurant|4|My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how lovely Pot au Feu is, with good French food and ambiance. The level of service is excellent. Some drawbacks are related to the lack of valet parking and other variables, such as patrons talking too loud and thus interfering with the overall satisfaction of those on a romantic date.
June 15, 2013|This long-time country French|5|This long-time country French bistro has become sort of a hidden gem, as tourism in Providence moves more and more away from downtown and toward Providence Place. Still, Pot Au Feu is located on the Independence Trail in an historic district. Its downstairs location reeks with European charm and atmosphere; and its entrees, salads, desserts (especially the amazing creme brulee) and bread cannot be beat, even in parts of rural France. The owner and manager is an unforgettable character who cares deeply about his restaurant as well as his city. Providence is lucky to have him. Customers who love French food are lucky to have Pot au Feu.
June 10, 2013|Fantastic|5|My husband and I chose the Pot au Feu to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. The night was wonderful, the food was fantastic, the wait staff was attentive and really made our celebration wonderful. We will remember our meal and intend to go back for another meal soon.
June 8, 2013|Cramped and Disconnected|2|The restaurant was cramped and the servers seemed to have trouble navigating around the tight space in the dining room. My biggest problem was that the meals didn't really fit well together. Whatever you ordered you had a choice of a potato (baked regular, baked sweet, french fries, herbed) plus a veggie (zucchini/squash). These were more of a throw in to give you more food rather than a well-planned compliment to the food item you ordered. I had the seafood crepes which were OK and my friend had 3 cheese quiche which was very good but the extras didn't fit. The escargot was very good and the wine was great but the discontinuity of the food just didn't make sense and because of that I don't recommend this restaurant.
June 8, 2013|Extraordiary food!|5|Hadn't eaten here in over a decade (rarely in Providence), and it was even better than I remember it. Spectacular service, food and persentation extraordinary, and having just returned from three weekks in Europe, still one of the best meals in a long time. Trying to get back to Providence in a month or two to eat here again. Highly recommended.
June 7, 2013|Old but Glorious Favorite|5|A true staple of the Providence food scene! Always perfect from greeting to goodbye! Sweet and russet friend potatoes with dill dipping are amazing! House pâté with the freshly served bread is a perfect start...creme brûlée is the perfect finish! The owner personally ensures your experience is grand!
June 1, 2013|Great time, everything was|5|Great time, everything was perfect, just as we expected
May 29, 2013|Tres Bien|5|The service was great, the food was amazing. I will be coming back. French food at its finest/ Food in general at its finest.
May 11, 2013|French Basics|4|Solid menu, solid dining experience - not memorable. The staff is very amiable and the service was terrific. The food was predictable, well made but nothing to rave about. As with many French brasseries, this was French comfort food. Too many menu choices perhaps doesn't allow the chef to create anything magical. But I am sure this is an eatery that will serve you well over extended visits. Good wine list would be improved with more by-the-glass offerings. I am unsure of other French options and if there aren't any then this is worth going to.
April 27, 2013|Great food and service|5|Great atmosphere. Homemade dressings, fresh baked French bread right out of the oven. Our meals were perfectly cooked and delicious. Service was excellent. Wonderful dining experience and I look forward to going back.
April 20, 2013|Party of 5. Very cozy dining|5|Party of 5. Very cozy dining room with great atmosphere and brick walls. Romantics will enjoy. Great place for a date. Started with small salads and delicious homemade dressings that come with each meal. Fresh baked French bread right out of the oven and still warm is passed out by servers and is yummy. Really enjoyed it with the salad. All 5 of our meals were perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. There is a nice wine selection and full bar. The service was excellent. Our server was very attentive and polite. Our water glasses never went empty. It was a wonderful dining experience and I look forward to the next time.
April 13, 2013|We'll be back but...|3|We have been fans of Pot au Feu for many years. Admittedly we had been on hiatus for the past year and returned this past weekend. The food was excellent as always. However we were disappointed to find that there were probably 6 tables added to what had been a charming and comfortable setting. The space is not large to begin with, and it now seemed too crowded, too loud, and too busy. I understand the business considerations in such a move, but something was definitely lost in the experience. We will return, but now we'll apply a certain discomfort factor to Pot au Feu, when we consider our restaurant options.
April 13, 2013|Food was good but service|3|Food was good but service was slow. Our waitress seemed to have forgotten about us.
March 30, 2013|First visit and have been|3|First visit and have been looking forward to dining at Pot au Feu. Terrific menu, we had escargot and gravlax which were ok but not great, beef barley soup was great, pot au feu was very good as was filet. My issue with the restaurant was their wine list, limited and my first two selections were wrong vintages. Not one year off but a 2009 for a 2006...way off! I would try again as the menu is exceptional
March 26, 2013|A taste of France in Providence|5|Pot au Feu is a lovely friendly bistro type restaurant with a terrific menu of foods quite reminiscent of what one would find in provincial France. The cassoulet was amazing. Bob Burke, the owner and host, goes out of his way to make diners comfortable and has a terrific knowledge of French cooking and wines. Just outside the doors begins a marked walking trtail of historic Providence, which was Bob's brainchild.
March 24, 2013|Tasty food, eh service|2|The food was very good, but the service was not great. One waitress for many tables and she wasn't exactly friendly or attentive. The menu is varied but you can't really tailor anything to your particular taste or dietary needs. (and the waitress was rather disparaging when I asked about it) We probably won't go back, which is too bad because we have seasons tickets at the performing arts center near Pot au Feu so this would be a great place to go before/after a show.
March 9, 2013|Exceptional Restaurant|5|My husband and I always enjoy our evenings at Pot au Feu. The food, wine, ambiance and the Pot au Feu family are always outstanding !
February 28, 2013|The food and service were|4|The food and service were quite good here. I've never been big on French food, but I did enjoy the duck here as well as the creme brulee. I would recommend it to friends who do enjoy French food more than I.
