February 27, 2016|View/decor fantastic roof top rest. in RI|5|"I felt the food was great; however, the burger ordered took nearly an hour to come out! I was attending a performance at the Vets Auditorium, and time was running late. I was with the Producer and Host of ""Color of Jazz"" Radio, and was treating. I was embarrassed that I nearly had to cancel this one food item. Every time I asked wait staff if it was coming up shortly, they said yes. Then, more time went by. Other than that, amongst the best drinks, root top view and ambience in the city."
