And while it was rather loud it never became overbearing and was a testament to the relaxed and inviting atmosphere. Service was great from valet to management.
February 26, 2016|Best Pizza|5|Best pizza I've ever had in my life. Great spot, but be sure to make a reservation.
February 21, 2016|PizzaPerfection|5|Another Superb visit to Providence Coal Fired Pizza. Our App, Cocktails, Pizza and Service were excellent
February 21, 2016|Fantastic pizza steps from performing arts center|5|In and out quickly, and great coal fired pizza. Perfect before the show we attended 2 blocks away.
February 19, 2016|Excellent wings, pizza and 2 Noreasters ...|5|Excellent wings, pizza and 2 Noreasters each for drinks. One criticism is that I made a reservation 4 hours ahead, arrived a few minutes early and when our time was up, we were offered a high top or we could have to wait for a table. We took the high top (and glad that we did), but we're not happy with the way the hostess presented it considering that we have ample notice via OpenTable.
February 19, 2016|Food and atmoshpere great. Service was sub par|4|Arrived there just after 5:00 and the valet was no where in sight. Finally dropped my party off and parked on the street a few blocks away. Food was great but waitress was a bit rude and not very attentive
February 14, 2016|pizza|5|Thin crust pizza with mushrooms and ricotta was awesome as was the spinach and ricotta dip. Service was good, environment was good, solid choice. Would definitely come back here for pizza again.
February 12, 2016|Awful service. He was not attentive and ...|1|Awful service. He was not attentive and did not give our table any attention. The waiter didn't even notice we didn't order our meal yet and took our menus away. Didn't even take every guests order and tried walking away. Not happy.

February 6, 2016|Great time|4|We had reservations but arrived early so we had a seat at the bar. The bartenders were so personable that we decided to stay where we were. They recommended the pizza special of the night and it was fabulous. The house special wings were delivered quickly and were delicious. Will definitely be back!!!
February 6, 2016|Not Good|1|If I burnt a pizza at home, as bad as the one I ordered, I would throw it away. If you like the taste of burn, you'll love this pizza. The bottom crust was totally black but when I pulled off the crust, the dough was undercooked. Guess I'll stay with the ordinary, old fashioned oven baked pizza, that's cooked well and is crispy and tastes so good.

January 30, 2016|Wings and Pizza|5|If you're looking for a healthy pizza and wing combo, with great ambiance and service, look no further. This place is by far the best pizza place in all of Providence. There selection of pizza's are amazing and the specials they offer you can not compare to other restaurants in the area. If you don't like pizza, don't worry they have plenty of other selections your typical pizza joint would have. The bar area is beautiful and they have a back area to sit, eat and watch the pizza's get made.
January 30, 2016|Great spot for Excellent Pizza|5|I have been to both the Providence and North Kingstown locations - they offer an outstanding choice of awesome pizzas! Staff is great, ambiance is fun. Love to watch them making the pizzas. Always a first choice when going to PPAC!
January 30, 2016|Great Pre-show Lunch Venue|5|Great place to eat lunch before a 2 PM show at the PPAC.
January 29, 2016|Great food and excellent service.  We ha...|5|Great food and excellent service. We had the wings and goat cheese appetizers and then a few pizzas which was all excellent. Drinks were solid. Would highly recommend it.

January 26, 2016|Reservation delay|3|We had a reservation for 6:30 and had to wait 20 mins. Bus staff seemed clueless about which table to set next. Plenty of open tables but still had to wait. We were taking clients there for a basketball game and one was a diabetic who needed to eat very soon. He was cranky but we dealt with it and he did not make too much of a fuss. The server and our food were fabulous!!! Been here 10 times and this was the first time with an issue of any kind.
January 26, 2016|Can't wait to return|5|Food was absolutely delicious. We were a party of two. We ordered an arugula salad, spinach ricotta dip and a margarita pizza. Our server was friendly and efficient. We made a reservation to return before we left!
January 24, 2016|Excellent Pizza!|5|"My wife and I, New Yorkers, are frequent visitors to Providence. Pizza is my favorite food and it will not be astonishing for others to read that we New Yorkers can be a tad arrogant and geocentric when it comes to pizza (and maybe a few other things too); ""nothing comes close to NYC pizza!."" We've tried several recommended places for pizza by Providence locals, but PCFP keeps its place on the top of the list. The pizza crust is outstanding. Also, the side tossed salad was more than ample and very fresh. Highly recommended."

January 16, 2016|Great After even at the Dunk|5|Great place to go before or after a game. Great food and service.
January 3, 2016|Great Pizza|4|Great Pizza and waitress. We had the special and chicken wings. Great meal
January 2, 2016|Best Pizza I've had in a Long Time!|5|If you're not in the mood for the thin airy crust at Fellini's or the thick and substantial crust at Caserta's, but crave something in between, a chewy, crispy pie with some out-of-this-world toppings - look no further. My husband and I split a pizza here on a saturday with the intention of taking some home, which did not happen. In fact, we agreed we could have easily eaten another one, haha! Well worth the trip.
January 2, 2016|perfect lunch|5|this was our 1st time to pcfp and will not be the last. we choose to have lunch before going to the providence college mens basketball game. the service was great, the food very good and the atmosphere was very up beat.
January 1, 2016|Limited menu|3|I didn't realize that the menu is basically limited to pizza and a few appetizers. The food was good, just not enough variety for me. My grand daughters loved it, so a good place for kids.
December 23, 2015|Post theatre|5|Made a reservation for dinner after Trinity Rep. Staff was courteous the table was ready, we were a couple of minutes late and they did not mention it. Food was good the wings had been mentioned by other reviewers, we found them tasty but a little salty. The pizza was great, thin crust, toppings were fresh and well paired. We had kids with us age 11-18 and the atmosphere was appropriate for this age group. The service was quality, would recommend to friends.
December 19, 2015|Great food = great time.|5|This was probably my 4th time being to Providence coal fire pizza. The food did not disappoint and neither did the drinks. I've never had anything but a great experience with the wait staff. They're always offering suggestions for drinks and food. Just an overall great place.
December 19, 2015|Best Wings Ever|4|Sure, the pizza is good and the service is good, but it's the chicken wings that are beyond compare. Be sure to smother some pizza crust with the carmalized onions!
December 18, 2015|Delicious|5|Great food, friendly service, cool cocktails, love the atmosphere. Will definitely be returning.
December 13, 2015|Excellent dining experience|5|Although we had updated our reservation to include four additional people here on OpenTable the restaurant did not receive the update; nevertheless, the manager was very accommodating and made sure we had a table large enough to handle our large party of 14. The waiter was adept at making sure we had everything we needed and giving us the time to enjoy catching up with old friends and the great food. From the appetizers (the chicken wings were amazing!!) to the salads and the pizzas, each course was outstanding. Everyone at the table commented on how much they loved what they ordered. I had only been here a few times and I was a little unsure about how it would be with such a large group; everyone in our party had a wonderful time and I highly recommend it for large and small groups! Thanks for a wonderful evening!
December 13, 2015|the food and table service were excellen...|4|the food and table service were excellent. .. the hostess was not good at all. We gave our name as we entered, she enver acknolwged us just gave the menus to someone to show us to our table Very poor.
December 13, 2015|Great find!|4|We found this place after attending a show at Trinity....now whenever we go Downtown for any show we make it our go to place....we are looking forward to trying the newest location as well. Food and service are always good!
December 5, 2015|Great food and good service.|5|Valet parking is great, especially if you're going to a show or concert. We were seated at the pizza bar, fun to watch and the chefs are friendly. Pizza fantastic, The Rocket was delicious with the goat cheese & roasted veggies for an app. Our waitress forgot us for a moment, but the pizza chef noticed and grabbed our pizza. No problem. A little noisy on a Sat. night, very busy. Nice people all around.
December 5, 2015|A great first experience|4|We were looking for a reasonably priced lunch in downtown Providence. This restaurant is spacious, the service was great, and the food is well presented, tasty, and served fresh and quickly. We would definitely return if we were in the area.
November 27, 2015|Great wing|4|Pizza is on the expensive side but very good. Our waitress wasn't exactly inviting.....she had a smug look on her face like we were bothering her....
November 27, 2015|Great spot in Providence for pizza|4|Excellent atmosphere. Great selection of Pizza, draft beer menu is good, selection could be a little better. Our server could have been a little more upbeat and enthusiastic, just seemed like she would have rather been someplace else. Overall good place for coal fired pizza.
Dined on November 21, 2015|better than i remembered|4|i ordered a build your own pizza and it was great. i got a caesar in hopes that i wouldnt eat too much pizza. couldnt stop eating either......
November 21, 2015|Excellent food and service|5|Excellent food and service
November 21, 2015|Great pizza|4|We visited for the first time this past weekend. It was a busy Sat. Night with a PPAC show and PC game scheduled. We had a 5:25 reservation and where seating promptly and out the door with an hour. The pizza is very good- I am from New Haven so am rather picky about my pizza. The crust is thin and somewhat chewy. We got a meatball pizza and a Margarrta. Both very good but meatball better. We ended with the cannolis. We will go back for sure!
November 21, 2015|small size pizza, greasy, expensive, rus...|2|small size pizza, greasy, expensive, rushed service, overated
November 20, 2015|Mills|4|Nice little fine within the federal hill area. Would come back again
November 17, 2015|yummy conrad, boring caesar|4|the conrad pizza was very delicious. it was a little overdone but I like pizza that way. the caesar salad we shared was mediocre at best; little dressing and browned romaine, croutons seemed stale.
November 15, 2015|Great place for quick eats before or after a show.|3|Nice place, good food and bustling atmosphere. Not fine dining but great for quick eats before or after the show.
November 15, 2015|Great pre show dining spot|5|This was our first time at Providence Coal fired Pizza. We loved the hummus plate that we ordered and the pizza was delicious. We will definitely return to try other items on the menu. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Prices were reasonable. It was a great dining spot before going to the PPAC.
November 15, 2015|Nice pizza place close to Performing Arts Center|4|We were looking for an informal place to have a bite to eat prior to an event at the Providence Performing Arts Center. Prov. Coal Fired is a block from the Center and is a pleasant sit-down restaurant with superbly-prepared thin crust pizza and high-quality salads and starters. The pizza toppings are not overly adventurous, but the quality is high. The wine and beer list is solid, and the staff is exceptionally friendly.
November 13, 2015|Delicious Pizza|5|My husband and I came here before a concert at Lupo's. We split a ceasar salad, which was enough for two and had a 1/2 and 1/2 Rocket and Broccoli Rabe. Loved the red sauce on the rocket dog, that was our favorite. Crust was outstanding. Service was great, prices reasonable. We will definitely come back.
November 8, 2015|Light supper was super!|5|Was looking for a restaurant close to the Providence performing arts theater and this was the perfect spot for a salad and a pizza.
November 8, 2015|Providence Gem|5|Always a great meal with a great atmosphere. Chicken Wings are the best and the pizza is delicious. Excellent service!
November 5, 2015|thursday night|5|Had the wings, Caesar salad and the Conrad. All delicious as usual! Service was excellent even though they were hopping!
November 5, 2015|Good food but noisy|4|The food and drinks are always good but the noise factor makes it difficult to have a conversation.
October 31, 2015|Fabulous!!!|5|Six of us went and had the wonderful margarita pizza and the terrific steak pizza. Our waiter was fun, friendly and was so attentive! We loved it!!!
October 31, 2015|Special pizza with Brussel sprouts, baco...|5|Special pizza with Brussel sprouts, bacon was awesome. Wings always excellent.
October 22, 2015|PPAC DInner|5|We have season tickets to PPAC and just love eating at Coal Fired Pizza. The wine list has enough selections to accommodate the pizza selection. My wife and I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant. Just a great place for dinner.
October 17, 2015|We were late for our reservation and the...|4|We were late for our reservation and they were kind enough to wait for us on a Saturday night nonetheless.
October 17, 2015|great food & service|5|our table for 7 was waiting for us when we arrived - there was a wait & it was a busy Saturday night. We had 2 vegetarians & a vegan in the group, all were happy. The lentil & hummus salad was outstanding.
October 17, 2015|The pizza was yummy!!|5|It's not cheap but the food was yummy!!! The atmosphere was fun! Will definitely go again!!
October 16, 2015|"Awesome wings and ""The Conrad"" was great..."|5|"Awesome wings and ""The Conrad"" was great also!"

October 16, 2015|Great dinner!|5|We visited Providence Coal Fired Pizza before going to a show at PPAC. The food was wonderful, drinks very creative, waiter was helpful and they were able to provide all of this while giving us plenty of time to get to our show. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and plan to visit again soon. Thank you!
October 12, 2015|Great Thin Crust Pizza|4|This restaurant specializes in coal-fired thin crust pizza and it's fantastic! We ordered the basic margherita and it had just the right amount flavorful sauce, fresh basil and mozzarella. The outside edges of the crust were crispy and the bottom was cooked perfectly. We ordered a couple of cocktails and the one with the blueberry and lemon was outstanding. They have a variety of other menu options, wings, hummus etc. for those who aren't feeling like pizza. Saw a few reviews stating that they thought it was pricey. Maybe compared to fast food Dominos or Pizza Hut, but we paid $15 for a pizza with 8 slices. The quality is outstanding and we felt the price was worth it. Check this place out; you won't regret it!
October 10, 2015|Good pizza but loud|3|Good pizza, but it seems to cater to families. So, not the best venue for adult couples. Service was efficient, place was clean. Wish they had a separate room that was not so loud and crazy.
October 9, 2015|"The ""Conrad"" was excellent, the wings we..."|4|"The ""Conrad"" was excellent, the wings were excellent. The service was very good. The high top tables are not that comfortable."
October 3, 2015|Go for the wings|5|Best chicken wings anywhere. Above average, attentive service by Alonzo. It was nice having Phil, the manager coming around and asking how we were enjoying our dinner. Would highly recommend going for the wings.
October 3, 2015|Excellent will go again and again.|5|Thank you for a great experience. I had reservations for a bachelor party and I was late. Not only did they call me to make sure everything was ok. They held my reservation which was awesome and tried our party of six with class and great customer service. Loved the wings I highly recommend them to start they were delicious. Can't say enough how much we enjoyed the place. Thank you again.

October 2, 2015|Great before a show!|5|I booked an early reservation because we were going to a show at PPAC. We were waited on immediately and the waiter asked if we were going to PPAC, which I appreciated. The food was delivered in no time and it was hot and delicious. I have had some good pizza but this one was fantastic. It was noisy but it was just five o'clock and there was a group at the bar, probably having some drinks and apps after work. Who can blame them for blowing off some steam after a long week. It did not bother me. I just love the ambience and the wait staff is so friendly. Oh, did I mention the home made butterscotch pudding? It was so yummy and slid right down! My friend had never been there and loved it. I would go again in a minute. Thanks so much!
September 25, 2015|Liz is a great server and friendly. Food...|4|Liz is a great server and friendly. Food was okay. Pizza overdone and the rest okay.
September 20, 2015|Great food and awesome service|5|Our waitress provided absolutely great service. The food was also perfect. Four of us shared salad, pizza and wings. It was a great assortment of food. The drink list is also great.
September 20, 2015|Great as usual|5|Great wings. Great pizza. Great drinks. Great service. What else needs to be said?
September 19, 2015|Dodd is ALWAYS off the chart!  Cool pizz...|5|Dodd is ALWAYS off the chart! Cool pizza place, good beer selection, but LOUD! I super highly recommend it (don't go without getting the wings)!
September 18, 2015|Dinner experience|4|The food was good but a meatball pizza was very lightly sprinkled with meatball for the cost. We ordered a antipasti and had very little meat on.
September 14, 2015|Tasty Handmade Pizza|5|This was my first visit, and parking was convenient in the adjacent lot. The two of us shared the namesake offering of a coal fired pizza. The pizza was served quickly and hot from the oven. One pizza is plenty for two. The crust had excellent flavor, the sauce was just right, and the toppings were generous. Service was very attentive and friendly. My only issue was the noise level even on a Monday night with less than half capacity, which made conversation difficult. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone for the food, drinks, and excellent service.
September 12, 2015|Worth a visit.|4|Enjoyable meal and in the heart of Providence. We would go again.
September 7, 2015|Best pizza in new england|5|We are foodies and one of my favorites is Frank Pepe in CT, this coal fire pizza is excellent and easily beats out anything around the area.
September 7, 2015|Great Evening Out!|5|When to PCFP last night to celebrate the opening of a year working together, a group of ten of us. PCFP was great in accommodating us and even more phenomenal in making our meal and time there something special. Kevin our server was terrific -- making sure that our order was taken correctly, refilling our drinks, keeping us update on our meal. Everyone was fantastic. PCFP is a really great place to go to celebrate being together and sharing a good evening and terrific meal with friends! Thanks PCFP!
September 6, 2015|Worth Driving To|5|There are plenty of places to get pizza and beer but this is one worth driving 30 minutes to get to. Which we do. The location (downtown Providence) and atmosphere (lively restaurant/bar scene) are a little more special than your typical pizza place. The servers are very knowledgeable and professional. The food is outstanding and very reasonably priced. As most reviewers have probably said - for a pizza place, they have outstanding chicken wings. They also have outstanding pizza. We've been here three times and have enjoyed everything we've ordered. The salads are also excellent. The beer selection is pretty large. A very good place to go if you're in or near Providence.
Dined on September 6, 2015|Pizza with veal|5|Absolutely delicious! Crispy thin crust with veal on top. Dessert was the crisp with mixed berries.
September 4, 2015|When even we are in Providence, we stop ...|4|When even we are in Providence, we stop by for pizza. The food and drinks are excellent. My only complaint is the noise level in the restaurant. Makes it hard to have conversation with friends at your table. I am sure during an off time, it is fine.
August 25, 2015|Great pizza|4|Love their grilled pizza...we got the meatball, but we have tried their pepperoni one too... All great..
August 23, 2015|A hit every time|4|Their pizzas are awesome with the open coal fire that makes it very authentic. They are super accommodating if you want to do half-half on one pizza and/ or remove ingredients from some of theirs. Appetizers are awesome also. A mist for pizza in Providence in a comfy place!
August 15, 2015|Great service.|5|Always enjoy your restaurant. We had Rachael serve us on Saturday night. She did a great job. Had my two young kids with me, one who doesn't really like pizza. She willingly brought him some grilled chicken to eat as a meal and when he (10 yrs old) asked her for ketchup and none was in the restaurant she actually went next door and grabbed some from them so he can have it. She went above and beyond. Being a professional who oversees staff, these are the types of employees you want!! Great job.
August 8, 2015|Very good food. Good service nice atmosp...|4|Very good food. Good service nice atmosphere. Definitely coming back. The pizza has a beautiful crispy crust great sauce and fresh toppings.
August 8, 2015|Consistent  Always|4|Can't say enough about this place. My wife and I are frequent diners and it never fails as to just how good and fresh the ingredients are. The service is top rate and you can't fail if your server is Alonzo or Rachel. By the way, free valet so take good care of Manny..always smiling. Pizza's , salads cannot be beat. Do yourself a favor and get to a place that exudes consistency each and every time we go there...it is the best!!!
August 7, 2015|Got seated exactly at time of our reserv...|5|Got seated exactly at time of our reservation. All service prompt and friendly. Best pizza around. Reservations highly recommended. Walk-in wait at 6:30 Friday was 1 hour.
August 1, 2015|What a fun place - great for pizza and c...|5|What a fun place - great for pizza and craft beers!
August 1, 2015|Excellent pizza and service!|5|Our whole dinner experience was great. Our server explained the size of the pizzas and how they are cooked. And she was very knowledgeable about the extensive beer list without referring to anything on paper. Our pizzas were very tasty and our server was very attentive throughout the meal.
July 26, 2015|Best chicken wings I've ever had.|5|The pizza was a delicious thin crust eight very fresh ingredients, but the chicken wings blew me away. Coal fired with rosemary, sea salt, garlic and topped with onions they were absolutely delicious.
July 10, 2015|Everything was exceptional!|5|"Really nice setting and ambiance. The hostesses were friendly and attentive. The server was a little ""dry"". I've seen him before and he's usually ""up"" - maybe he was having an off day. However, the service was really good. The food is GREAT!!! Awesome salads, the wings are a must have, and the pizzas are delicious. There's a really good beer & wine selection, too. It's more expensive than your average pizza place, but it's not your average pizza place!"
June 26, 2015|Best NYC style pizza in Providence|4|Love this Pizza! Moved up from the NY metro area and been living in RI for almost 40 years. If you wanted good pizza you had to head up to Federal Hill. PCFP does it right every time. Great Arugala Salad and a beer or bottle of wine and you're golden. Not crazy about the appetizers which are a little quirky, but hey, we go for the pizza. Valet parking makes it much easier to get in and out given the Providence downcity parking situation, but for a few extra bucks is well worth it. You gotta try this place!
June 24, 2015|Delicious food...upscale atmosphere...ve...|5|Delicious food...upscale atmosphere...very loud at times
June 19, 2015|Great Service, Meal and Location|5|This was my first visit to Providence Coal Fire Pizza and I can't wait to go back, from the moment I walked into the restaurant to the moment I left, it was truly a great experience, I can't wait to go back soon! Our waiter was fantastic, Alanzo (sorry, not sure if I spelled that correctly). The pizza was fantastic, drinks were great and dessert was amazing. I highly recommend. Thank you.

June 12, 2015|Colsstone Pizza|4|We had 3 appetizers, pizza, food was excellent, very reasonably priced. We sat outside, the dining room, bar very noisy. I would definitely go back.
June 11, 2015|Theater night|5|We had a reservation for two before going to PPAC. Our server was Sarah. She was pleasant , funny, and super efficient--attentive but not overbearing. She was perfect! As usual the food was great! We had the hummus appetizer and split a pizza. It's a great place to visit before a show or anytime! Highly recommended.
June 6, 2015|Great  Restraunt|5|We had a great time at coal fire pizza, the service was outstanding, the pizza as always is delicious. The chicken wings are to die for so good . I love when a restraunt is adding something new to the menu and they let the customers try it and give feedback - we tried a crabmeat stuffed mushroom cap which was unbelievable ,so good The sangria red and white are very refreshing , the overall experience was great

June 6, 2015|Interesting Pizza|4|I really enjoyed the Broccoli Rabe and Mushroom pizza! My daughter would have appreciated a bit more cheese on the margarita.
May 30, 2015|The Best of Both Worlds..Great Service, Great food|5|Pizzas, wings and salads are what keep us coming back time after time. You will not find a better team to serve this incredible food roasted in a 900 degree oven. From the manager Vicki, to Sarah, Alonzo or Rachel, service and smiles are not put one but these people really care about your food experience and will go out of there way to have you returning time and time again. Free valet service on arrival (say hi to Manny) great guy, great smile! At times, this place is vibrant with people of all ages so be sure to make a reservation if you don't want to wait in a long line...the food is that good and they always have special pizzas of the day. With spring and summer upon us, there are also a few tables outside for bistro dining.
May 30, 2015|Great Providence eatery|5|After 4 years of trips to Providence this was a first experience at Providence Coal-fired Pizza and an absolutely delightful experience. Great variety of pizza and salads. Creative beer selection and a knowledgeable and attentive staff. On this day many families celebrating a college graduate and all served in a way that made them feel special.
May 26, 2015|consistently great pizza and salads.|5|Crust is crispy but at the same time has a bit of chewiness which we like. pizza sauce is fantastice--not too sweet.
May 23, 2015|The pizza and the meatball appetizer wer...|4|The pizza and the meatball appetizer were delicious. Was disappointed that there were only 3 meatballs in the appetizer. Also thought there were supposed to be more items on menu than just pizza, appetizers and salad. Waiter was friendly and attentive. A bit noisy and would have liked a better table.
May 22, 2015|Best chicken wings around.|4|Fun and relaxing atmosphere but not my favorite for the pizza. Maybe it's the oven but crust is always to charred for my liking. That's all you can taste. I prefer FlatBread pizza company or Bob and Timmy's in the Hill.
May 16, 2015|second time not a charm|2|I hate to leave a bad review because I hate to be negative. Unfortunately, the service was so bad this time at the restaurant that we won't be back. The first time we sat at the bar and had delicious food and great service, this time was anything but. Our appetizer was very good, but unfortunately our pizza was overcooked this time and not great to say the least. Our server R****l was some of the worst service we've had in a long time. She wouldn't even let us finish ordering before she would walk off, this happened multiple times. Not to mention never even saying goodbye or to have a good night. Between her service and the food being disappointing this time, we won't be back. It's a bummer because we really enjoyed our first visit, but with so many great restaurants around consistency is key!
May 10, 2015|Off Day|2|I've been to Coal Fired Pizza many times since it opened. I always rated it the best pizza in Providence. Today, the pizza was awful and it seemed smaller than usual. I hope this is not the beginning of a trend. Or it will be off my list quickly.
May 2, 2015|Excellent again. We will always come bac...|5|Excellent again. We will always come back. Cozy and comfortable
April 25, 2015|Date Night for 2|5|I visited here with my boyfriend since we were in town for the weekend and WOW, what a great surprise this was! The meatballs and the sauce with it were OUTSTANDING. The pizza is slightly overpriced but was very good. Would give this place an A overall and would gladly return for a future visit.
April 23, 2015|Coal Fire|5|The best wings and pizza in Providence! Thursday nights is Meat Lovers Pizza night! Yum or build your own. Make reservations it's always busy !
April 22, 2015|My new go-to restaurant for PPAC show nights|4|Such great ambiance to grab a bite before a show at the PPAC which is within easy walking distance. Our server made great recommendations! We tried the Mirtillocello cocktail which was delicious and the veggie pizza & chicken caesar salad were quite good. There was plenty of nearby parking that was reasonably priced and made getting out of Providence much easier than being closer to PPAC. Would definitely go again!
April 20, 2015|Pizza Never Disappoints|5|I have never been disappointed at Providence Coal Fired Pizza. The food is amazing. Highly recommend the chicken wings; and the pizzas are delicious (Personal favorites are The Rocket and the Meatball). Great service, good beer and drink selection, and a nice location. Look forward to coming back soon!
April 19, 2015|Great Experience|5|We went to see the Frankie Valli concert in Providence. I found this restaurant online. It exceeded my expectations. Pizza was delectable, and wings were a pleasant surprise. Our server was attentive and engaging.
April 19, 2015|Lunch|4|We went for lunch with a large group on a Sunday and they were accomodating. The pizza was delicious
April 18, 2015|Phenomenal food!!|5|Phenomenal food!!
April 18, 2015|What's not to love???|5|The Chicken Wings/Legs with Rosemary, Caramelized Onions & Sea Salt are delicious. The Rocket Pizza is delicious. Definitely make reservations or you will most likely have to wait at least an hour before a table is opened up for you. This place is always hopping. The wait staff is always professional and on top of taking care of the customer.
April 12, 2015|Nothing Special|3|If you really want good pizza that is not the place I suggest you go up to the hill. We had this BBQ pulled pork with not much toppings on it, and the size was rather small. We thought $19 was also overpriced for what we got. . The best part was the very fast service we received from the waiter we had.
April 12, 2015|Great Sunday lunch|5|The pizza was just wonderful an amazing blend of flavors from sweet to salty, great sangria too! With the high ceilings, noise was never a problem even though there were several families with young children... Highly recommend...
April 11, 2015|Delicious but watch out for added toppings!|4|We've been here multiple times now and love our pizza every time. But I wanted to review it again because this time we did not get a specialty pizza; we created our own. When they charge for toppings, it costs the same whether you put your topping on the whole pizza or only half. We paid $27.50 for a pizza that was half olive and pepperoni and half sausage, onion, and mushroom. It would have cost the same exact amount had we put all 5 toppings on the entire pizza, which would have doubled the amount of toppings. Maybe this is normal but I've never encountered it before. So this ended up being the most expensive pizza we have ever bought. We probably will be more careful about toppings in the future.
Dined on April 5, 2015|Good--not great|3|"We had the coal-fired wings first which were not your standard wings and very tasty. I would get them again and be happy. The pizza arrived promptly and the cheese, sauce, and toppings were quite good. However, as others have noted in other reviews, the crust was unevenly cooked with burned spots--not the whole crust, but patches. Not sure if it was due to the ""coal-fired"" process, or these areas, but the pizza crust overall ended up with a slightly bitter, charred taste. My husband was not bothered by it and found it good; I did not agree. I could eat it, but did not want any more. Our waiter was attentive and did a good job, but we were one of the only tables int he restaurant, so his job was not very difficult."
April 4, 2015|food was enjoyed by all.  great place fo...|4|food was enjoyed by all. great place for a group.
March 28, 2015|As good as pizza in Naples, Italy!|5|I have dined here on numerous occasions and never been disappointed. I've had pizza in Naples Italy and this pizza is just as good! Not only are the pizza's delicious but the appetizers are outstanding. The broccoli rabe with sausage is delicious, cooked to perfection, with homemade sausage. The chicken wings/legs come with a topping of onions and could be a meal in themselves. The arugula salad is fresh and crisp with a light lemon, olive oil vinaigrette. One would think a pizza place couldn't make dessert but do yourself a favor and have the butterscotch pudding it is outstanding!!! What a find in downtown Providence.
March 28, 2015|Providence Coal Fired Pizza|5|Excellent venue before or after an event at The Dunk! Pizza and wings are delicious, great service.
March 28, 2015|Great Stop Before the Dunk|4|Tuscan Wings are absolutely addictive. Just enough crispy onion strings and salt to keep you drinking. Pizza was great. They gladly do half and half pizzas to share. We had a half Steak and a half Baby Bella. Great flavor combinations, especially with the Gorganzola on the Steak. Baby Bella could have used a little more truffle oil, but was still tasty. Crust was cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, but a airy with a little chew on the inside. Nice martini menu, including the Cucumber Cosmo. Pretty good craft beer selection, but nothing too exotic.
March 28, 2015|#GoFriars|5|Coal Fired Pizza was very accommodating to our large group of sixteen on a Saturday & Sunday afternoon. We were in Providence to watch the NCAA Ice Hockey Frozen Four. Coal Fired accepted our reservations and provided excellent service both days. The food was delicious too.
March 27, 2015|Delicious dining|4|There are almost no words to describe the flavor bursting from the ricotta and meatball pizza. This combination is ultimate. Paired with the perfectly seasoned rosemary chicken wings, that are cooked to a crispy, baked texture, this meal is great. The price was definitely fair and I highly recommend this restaurant!
March 27, 2015|Great food, great service,  bustling atmosphere|4|Providence Coal Fired Pizza does a few things and does them well. We had the BBQ pork pizza, which was just the right size for two to share and was delicious. They have a good beer list and they mix good drinks well. My companion raved about the espresso martini. Service is friendly and professional. Prices are very reasonable: pizza, drinks and dessert for two for under $60 before tip. The atmosphere is high energy, but not oppressively loud. We will definitely return.
March 21, 2015|Excellent Pizza!|4|Every time we come to Providence, we always have a meal at Providence Coal Fired Pizza. The pizza's and martinis are great. Service is always good too.
March 13, 2015|Pizza is excellent, very loud, service not great|4|"We love the food, but our waiter was a little strange and unattentive. Also, it was supposed to be martini weekend, but there was no discount on the martinis. They said it came with a ""little bite."" Well I was so insulted by the little bite, that I sent it back. It was a one inch square of melon with a tiny ribbon on prosciutto on a toothpick. Really?? At that point, don't do anything at all. They would have been better off offering the drinks at a discounted price if it was ""martini weekend."" Unfortunately we left a little annoyed, and the bill was high. With all the competition out there, you have to stay competitive or people will find other places to go."
March 10, 2015|Great place|5|Great place for some rustic coal fired pizza. The pizza was decent, good appetizers, and martini's were tasty, but were not worth 11.00$. Service was excellent, and the server was very friendly and knowledgeable.
March 8, 2015|Great Service|4|Kori was wonderful. She made our dining out fun. She knew her wines and her pizza. We were running late, so I called and they held our table. We had dinner and dessert and still had plenty of time to make the show at PPAC. Great size pizzas with fresh ingredients.
March 7, 2015|Best Pizza in City|4|I've been to Coal-Fired Pizza many times. Consistently outstanding pizza in a usually crowded scene.
March 7, 2015|Would go again|5|Loved the pizza. To fancy for my 10 year old. Chicken wings were great.
March 6, 2015|It was awesome!|5|A must go for great pizza. & If you can find a deal it is even more enticing!
February 28, 2015|Great place. ..AWESOME PIZZA! !!  Our ta...|5|Great place. ..AWESOME PIZZA! !! Our table for 6 was waiting for us thanks to OPENTABLE. Can't wait to go back 😆
February 27, 2015|Eeh okkk|1|This restaurant looks really nice- I don't know if I would go back. Our watriess spilled a drink in my plate and I lost a huge piece of pizza she didn't care and said I hope you like lemonade- crazy she was rude. and didn't seem to care
February 27, 2015|Great cozy, casual spot.|4|Great cozy spot with good food and pretty reasonable wine prices. We had a delicious meal and very good service.
February 26, 2015|Coal fire pizza|5|Great pizza...love the meat lovers pizza! The chicken wings are to die for! Its always busy here so make reservations!
February 26, 2015|The food is always outstanding!|5|Even the sidewalk was shoveled. Reservations are always honored and always on time! Love this place. I would recommend putting some heat in the lavatories. They are always freezing.
February 24, 2015|Dinning with 6 women and trying to make ...|5|Dinning with 6 women and trying to make it to a show, we really appreciated our waiters suttle hints of time.
February 14, 2015|Excellent pizza place!|5|This is a great restaurant for a casual night out. The pizzas are creative and delicious, and the beer and wine lists are thorough and expansive. I highly recommend the wings. They aren't sauce-drenched buffalo wings, but rather an herb-encrusted variety with a small kick. They are different than anything I've seen anywhere else.
January 31, 2015|One of the best for pizza in New England!|5|This is one of my favorite places for pizza in New England. The crust on the pizza is crispy as a result of the ovens and the even the tomato is so good I end up licking up every drop! Try the sangria - there is a little something extra in it. Don't know what but it is very refreshing. I've had both the salads and the hummus for appetizers and both are delicious. Very friendly staff and a great atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant!
January 17, 2015|Great pizza!|4|We love their pizza. Thin crust in the middle but a nice thicker outer crust. My husband and son also love the crisp delicious chicken wings.
January 17, 2015|Very good!|4|A great vibe on a Saturday - a bit noisy but not too much. Service was so-so but the pizza was great. We had a traditional meat pizza and one off the menu. We brought a very picky eater - he loved the pizza and the ambiance, so we were happy!
January 17, 2015|Nice!|4|The pizza was quite good, although I would say that the coal-fire quality was the only true attraction. The menu is quite limited. The artichoke/pancetta appetizer was beautifully presented even if the palate of the dish wasn't particularly special. Nice beer/wine list.
January 16, 2015|The waiter we had was very prompt and fr...|4|The waiter we had was very prompt and friendly. The special pizza for Friday night was excellent.
January 9, 2015|Very good, fresh thin, pizza|5|Providence Coal Fired Pizza is a hidden gem. The place has some of the tastiest thin pizza on earth. I'm a pizza guru and this place was delicious. Even the salads before our pizza was serviced was fresh and bountiful. This place should do well. The only drawback is they have a limited menu and specialize in pizza and a few other starters.
January 4, 2015|Great service, excellent food, Laid back Favorite|5|Have been here a few times since the restaurant opened and each visit has been progressively improved! The last visit was exceptional, service and food. Food has always been excellent - mostly have had the pizzas, which are uniquely prepared via the coal fired ovens. Love the tomato soup, and the cocktails are generous. Wings are to die for - do yourself a favor and order these - crispy, with a touch of salt and rosemary - perfection. The hostess and wait staff were very accomodating on our last visit. They handled our seating change request graciously and I can not thank them enough! The place was packed full on a Sunday evening, which is an indication of success and a compliment to the staff and food.
January 3, 2015|Sweet Pizza Joint|4|Coal Fire Pizza has a few pluses: great atmosphere, complimentary valet, good beer selection, and tasty pizza. Our waiter seemed a bit bummed when we decided not to order any alcohol. Since this is a pizza joint, I was underwhelmed by the variety of pizza options. I was expecting out of the ordinary choices, but it was just the usual: meatball, margherita, pepporoni. At the end of the menu there were options to make your own pizza. We settled for a meatball pizza and we added spinach for some flare. Pizza was wicked tasty, and crunchy.
January 3, 2015|Love it|5|Great place to eat. Love the wings and pizza's. Drinks are good. Sit at the bar and watch your favorite sports or fresh pizza being made. Make a reservation as this place gets busy.
January 2, 2015|Pizza excellent, chicken wings a must|4|Kid friendly, noise level just right. Pizza cooked in eight hundred degree oven provides a unique taste and experience. Chicken wings cooked in same oven with heaping pile of onions and spices are unbelievable
January 2, 2015|Best Pizza Around|5|My husband and I have been here three times in the last few months. The meatball pizza was incredible. The Rocket (with prosciutto added) was amazing. We were not in love with the broccoli rabe and sausage but it was also good. Their crust is the best pizza crust I've ever had.
December 31, 2014|Great Pizza in Downtown Location|5|Coal-Fired Pizza perhaps has the best pizza restaurant in greater Providence. The pizza choice is excellent and it has a good wine and beer list. The storefront atmosphere is fun. It is conveniently located and has valet parking.
December 31, 2014|Solid Tasty Selections|5|As you enter the building we were treated by a very friendly Hostess. She was able to seat us quickly. The smokey scents from the oven make for a pleasant environment and we were treated quickly by our server. The special was explained and our questions answered thoroughly. He was able to give very solid beer suggestions which my wife loved the one he choose for her, mine, well you can't go wrong with Dogfish Head!! The wings were terrific, great flavors and chrisped perfectly. A very nice combo of rosemary and sauted onion. The kids had sausage pizza. The homemade sausage has great flavor and just a hit of heat which was inoffensive to they little mouths. The red sauce is just slightly sweet and was a perfet complement to the sausage. The house special was a white sauce with potato, panchetta sauted onion drizzled with garlic infused olive oil and shalots. It was very good. The only downside to Coal fired in Providence is the parking situation, only pay lots and it was $9 to park for on hour and ten minutes!!
December 20, 2014|Most apathetic group of waitstaff|2|Food: The appetizers where the stars of the meal we had. The Crab Stuffed Artichokes wrapped with Proscuitto was tasty and well done. The goat cheese with roasted tomatoes was an all around I would eat that again. The Pizza was uninspired. We had the mushroom pizza and all I can say is the mushrooms were cooked well and the crust was decent. But overall it was pretty bland, it's almost as if they went out of their way to make it tasteless. The blast of truffle oil was an interesting touch, not sure if they just added this to help market the pizza, but it didn't really contribute in any meaningful way to make this pizza any better. The Drinks. We had the Moscow Mule. Other than the copper cup presentation, this drink was again under flavored and uninteresting. A bit like Vodka with water and lime, and maybe as an afterthought someone swirled ginger in the concoction. The Service: I have no idea how these people still have jobs... the entire waitstaff couldn't even acknowledge that there may be customers sitting at the table. Anyone in the service industry knows that when you're engaging the customer you should probably not look bored and scan the room while you're taking someone's order. Then even before the customer has finished the ordering start walking away. That was also the highlight of the service, didn't think it could happen but it got even worse. I don't expect the waitstaff to be chatty and friendly, but I do expect the waitstaff to not ignore the patrons.
December 13, 2014|Tasty Fun|4|Very good pizzas, but the wings and ribs are the unsung heroes... Solid beer selection, good service, and a lively atmosphere make this a great spot for gathering with friends.
December 8, 2014|Awesome Pizza|5|"Tried the ""Conrad"" pizza for the first time- WOW this place takes pizza to the next level."
December 8, 2014|Great Atmosphere and Location|4|Great atmosphere. Right around the corner from Lupo's. Warm, welcoming, friendly, especially cozy in the winter. Pizza was awesome, but more meatless creations would be appreciated. You can build your own of course.
December 7, 2014|Cool Place|4|Providence Coal Fired Pizza is a cool little place convenient to the Trinity Rep and PPAC. They only serve pizza, salad and soup. The pizza and salad were good. I thought the salad should have come out before the pizza. My daughter and I shared a regular size salad and pizza. We also had the calzones. Our waitress was very nice but a bit forgetful but we still made to the theatre on time and we weren't rushed.
Dined on December 7, 2014|Great Pizza|5|Always a good time, good food, good service, right in downtown Providence. We love their Baby Bella pizza. Terrific location; between Trinity Repertory Theater and Providence Performing Arts Center. Parking lot right next door to the restauant. Easy walks to all downtown from beautiful Westminster Street!
December 6, 2014|Nice dinner date spot|4|nice dinner date spot if not looking to spend a lot but do something a little nicer. Grilled pizza tastes so fresh and lots of unique kinds of pizza, but not too crazy so there is something for everyone. The espresso martini is phenomenal!
November 29, 2014|Every time we visit Providence, we like ...|3|Every time we visit Providence, we like to dine at Providence Coal Fired Pizza. We had a great table with water glasses already filled when we arrived at our table. The food was excellent as usual. The service was good, however we felt we were being rushed thru our meal. It would have been nice to enjoy our cocktails before having our salads arrive. The same with the desert. While one member of our party was finishing the last of the pizza, we were being asked about desert. There appeared to be no wait for tables as it seemed to be a slow night, therefore I am not sure why we were being rushed. Hopefully, our next visit will be a more relaxed experience.
November 29, 2014|Coal? Yup.|4|"When my wife found out we were going to a ""coal-fired"" pizza restaurant, I think she had some sort of fossil fuel style reservations. Turns out coal is a splendid way to cook just about anything. The salad was delicious, the baked brie was amazing, and the pizza was top of the line."
November 28, 2014|Was very good and fresh and wasn't too loud inside|4|Had the margarita pizza with eggplant and spinach and it was very good- plus I was smart and made a reservation so I didn't have to wait
November 21, 2014|I'd go again.|4|Decent appetizer selection but it would be nice if they served some of those apps in larger portions as entree's for that person in the crowd who's not in the mood for pizza. That being said, their pizza is delicious! Very light yet crispy crust, fresh ingredients and well thought out list of specialty pizza. I'll be there again.
November 15, 2014|Disappointing Miss on All Accounts|2|Unfortunately, all four of us were under-whelmed with the Providence Coal Fired Pizza. It was very loud and cavernous, the waiter was difficult to find, not attentive and not friendly, and the food was over-priced and not very flavorful. We're happy to pay $20 for a pizza if it is delicious. It's not a Providence Coal Fired Pizza. Unfortunately, this restaurant was a miss on food, service and atmosphere. And, with parking difficult to find and the restaurant's own valets also difficult to find it did not make for an experience we want to repeat.
November 15, 2014|Providence Coal Fired|1|Providence Coal fired is arguably the best pizza in Rhode Island. The staff is very friendly, and the management is very welcoming. They deserve the success they continue to enjoy...the non pizza menu items are quite good also.
November 10, 2014|Pizza was ok. Wings rocked and were the ...|3|Pizza was ok. Wings rocked and were the best part of the meal.
November 8, 2014|Best Pizza in Downtown Providence|4|Despite having to send back the first pizza because it was burned to a crisp, Coal Fired Pizza has best pizza around. The service is very good for a crowded restaurant. The list of wines by the glass is adequate although a glass is pricey. It is in a good location and has valet parking. I've been many times and always have been satisfied.
November 8, 2014|PC BB Night Out|5|Great fun atmosphere and delicious food. Signature chicken wings delicious.
November 8, 2014|No Better Pizza|4|Drop car off to valet (complementary parking) and head in to room filled with high energy and if you go early, the noise level is acceptable. Go later and if didn't make a reservation, you lose!!! Appetizers are outstanding, especially wings w/ grilled onions. Super antipasto and several dynamite salads to choose from. The pizza special was an autumnal creation consisting of pumpkin, applewood smoked bacon, and 2 different cheeses. Opted for a white pizza with sausage, bacon, and 2 cheeses that came out piping hot ...outstanding. Great cocktails and the service is awesome. If you get servers either Rachael or Alonzo...you win!!!! Not cheap, but great value for the money.
November 7, 2014|Continued great!!|5|This works well for Providence Performing night. Foods great, drinks are fab and timing is great for the show!!!
November 6, 2014|Great spot for pre theater dining|5|Enjoyable food, atmosphere and the service staff was very friendly. We were a group of five and were at a round table perfect for conversation. The food was excellent as usual.
November 4, 2014|Favorite|5|This is our favorite Providence restaurant on event nights. Great food, drinks and service. Never disappoints.
November 1, 2014|They get it|5|Have been here upwards of five times, each time is as consistently excellent as the last. Wings are Ah. Maze. Ing. Pizza is great, drinks are a good value, delicious and good-sized. Convenient valet parking, lovely location. Truly no complaints. A definite go-to casual place, great for people watching.

October 28, 2014|Great pizaa|4|We had a special pizza..the meatlovers. Pepperoni, sausage and meatballs with mozzarela and garlic oil.... OMG...what a delicious pizza it was.. Specially the tiny pieces of pepperoni, they were delightfully browned with just the right amount of spice....delicious. Next time I go, I'm asking for a pepperoni pizza !!! YUM... One things.....the crust sometimes seems a bit burnt (that happens a lot at PCFP) ..
October 25, 2014|Hip Pizza Place|5|Popular and bustling, Providence Coal Fired Pizza serves up delicious appetizers and pizzas. The ambiance is relaxed, hip and friendly. The pizza is thin and tasty with many interesting selections. The beer selection does not disappoint. We always enjoy our meal here!
October 25, 2014|This was my second time the food is real...|4|This was my second time the food is really good. Pizza dough has great flavor, cooked perfectly nice and crisp crust! Great wings! My only complaint is that its noisy and loud.
October 25, 2014|First Visit But Not Last!!!|4|Great wings, antipasti and cocktails are standard order but the pizza is just outstanding. Had an original created pizza which consisted of a white pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, red onion, pancetta and blue cheese was one of the best pizza's I've had in a long time. With a 900 degree oven, everything came piping hot and Rachael our server was there with refills and checking up on us throughout the evening. Complimentary valet parking is also a great service as I would rather take care of the valet then park next store at $10.00 in a dimly lit area. I strongly recommend that you make a reservation ....yes for a pizza but once you try this place out as my wife and I did, you too will become a repeat customer. Ask for Rachael the best!
October 24, 2014|More thn your ordinary pizza pub!|5|My husband son and I had a nice early dinner at coal-fired pizza. I LOVED the specialty drink with apple cider, brandy and cinnamon infused vodka. Usually these drinks are too sweet or strong for my taste but this was delicious! Pizza good but a bit soupy on top. Mushroom caps were delicious - one came complementary with my drink - and the chef made up a plate of them on request!
October 19, 2014|Clam pizza good, could be great.|4|We had the Sunday special, it was very good. Also ordered the clam. The flavors on that pie were delicious. The only thing that could make that a world class pizza is either changing to baby clams or chopping the littlenecks. Bad mouth feel when you get a whole clam and its a bit rubbery. Otherwise, we had a great time and will come back again.
October 18, 2014|Lib|4|The wood fired Wings with Rosemary and onions was awesome, The salads are fresh and the pizza even better. Recommend it to anyone. They have valet parking out front.
October 18, 2014|Food always great!|4|We've been to Coal Fire numerous times and always enjoy it. Food is delicious and atmosphere is great. Make a reservation on weekends because you will wait during prime eating time. Feel free to bring your well behaved children because it's a louder environment. Great place to go with friends, an extensive beer on tap list and fresh food. One downside it our waiter the most recent time we were there. We have had this same waiter in the past and he is less than impressive. Seems disinterested, takes a long time to greet his tables, does not offer specials, etc. It surprises me that he remains employed there since everything about Coal Fire is great besides this one employee.
October 18, 2014|POST THEATRE|5|AFTER ATTENDING AN AFTERNOON PERFORMANCE OF CINDERELLA MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND I WALKED TO COAL FIRE PIZZA AND HAD AN ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS PLATE OF CHICKEN WINGS AND AN ARRUGALA AND PEPPERONI PIZZA. FABULOUS AND WILL RETURN. SERVICE GREAT. YOU NEED A RESERVATION.
October 17, 2014|great food, service, a little noisy|5|We made a reservation with open table for a saturday evening at 7:15. The hostess sat us right away and the sever came soon after. The menu consists of appetizers, salads and pizzas. The salad was very fresh with nice greens and vegetables. The pizza crust is very crispy and has a nice crunch. The toppings are creative and go beyond the usual toppings. We had the special with shrimp, asparagras and a garlicky pesto sauce. I like that this restaurant is on the Trinity Rep subscribers restaurant list. The only thing that I would change about this restaurant is the noise level. When the restaurant is full, it is quite loud. It is not a show stopper though. The food and service will bring me back.
October 16, 2014|SOOOO Delicious!|5|Tomato soup was fantastic as was the lentil hummus salad. Looking forward to returning
October 16, 2014|Burnt Pizza|2|We have been to Coal Fired Pizza many times, but lately the food has gone downhill, especially the pizza. We have been served burnt pizza, literally the crust on the three pizzas were black unediable. We had no to send it back because we were going to the theater, so we just ate the center part of the pizza.
October 12, 2014|Great pizza|4|We went to try the coal fired pizza and we're not disappointed Not the best area of providence but parking is close
October 10, 2014|Definitely make reservations if going on...|4|Definitely make reservations if going on a Friday night and PPAC has a something going on!

September 26, 2014|Wings wings and more|5|The chicken wings are the best. Large order is 16 count. We were 4 in our party and we wish we had ordered two orders of them just to have take home. The pizza is awesome and the ingredients are fresh and full of flavor. Again order more than you think you can eat so you will have take home. Better yet just order up befor you leave.
September 7, 2014|Excellent pizza|4|The menu is pretty much pizza and salads. Fortunately, the pizza was excellent. It was thin crust slightly charred. It would have been nice to have the option of buffalo mozzarella but otherwise the choices were fine. Pretty good wine list with a reasonable markup.
September 3, 2014|Outandabout|5|We went on a Wednesday evening and it was pretty busy. Great service and terrific pizza. Loved the wings. Used Livind Social discount but will definitely return!
September 1, 2014|Disappointed|2|We've been here before and it was awesome. I was dying to go back. So we went with our 2 kids. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. Our server seemed pretty nice, but once our order was placed she vanished. I watched her scramble from table to table and she was too busy to check on us. We had lost a kiddie cup early on so there was juice on the floor and all the napkins. We would have liked to order her another and get napkins for the table. When our pizza arrived, after watching it take a detour to another table, it was no longer hot. Tasty but cold, like it sat waiting for ten minutes. We weren't checked on until we were pretty much done. For the expense and this experience, I was pretty disappointed.
August 30, 2014|Not a wide variety of food choices and t...|3|Not a wide variety of food choices and too noisy for us Pizza was not the best I have ever had Waitress was good
August 29, 2014|Fast Service|5|If you let them know you have to leave by a certain time they bend over backwards to help!
August 23, 2014|Good old style pizza|5|Great coal fired pizza reminiscent of Frank Pepe's
August 22, 2014|Perfect|4|Great casual dining with a variety of pizzas and salads. The wings were awesome!
Dined on August 21, 2014|great pizza|4|I'm italian from italy and i brought my italian family directly from italy, they missed pizza and found it to be really good and close to the original one, the tomato sauce was excellent, you can taste the difference from other normal oven baked pizza. we recommend the margherita with anchovies as extra (close to the napoletana pizza) and the rocket with prosciutto di parma as extra.
August 21, 2014|good food|4|Good food at reasonable prices. Waiter was less than enthusiastic. Maybe he was tired, but it definitely impacted giving the establishment 5stars.
August 20, 2014|Great Pizza Before a Show|4|Everyone must have read my last review because they all showed up at Providence Coal Fired Pizza before the Jackson Browne Show. Despite the packed house, service was great and the pizza just what we ordered. The only issue I have is that the noise level was over the top. Okay, it was packed, but still it was really hard to even attempt a conversation. The noise level died down a bit as people headed out for the show and was fine for the last part of our meal. BTW we made the show with no problem and Jackson Browne was fabulous!
August 20, 2014|Regular favorite spot.|5|Only restaurant we go to when there is an event or a reason to go downtown. Always good and excellent service. Good drinks. Always get you out in time for the show or game.
August 18, 2014|Chicken wings to die for|4|We just had salad and wings, but took a couple of pizzas home. They were just as good reheated.
August 16, 2014|Cold Fired Pizza was great.|5|Went to this place for the first time and ordered the chicken wings which were unbeliable, not barbecue or chinese, they were cooked in the coal fire oven with some caramelized onions on top. Great taste. Then the pizza - well what can I say-it was awesome. The red and white sangria is very good and the salads are cold and crispy. The service was excellent even though the restaurant was very busy and our waitress was very entertaining. The prices were very reasonable also.
August 16, 2014|Best Pizza in Providence|4|Great pizza and a lot of unique varieties and toppings. Very Pricey!
August 15, 2014|Pizza nite|2|This was my second time to this restaurant and I was not impressed this time with the food. The first time we ordered a specialty pizza which was very good. On this occasion we ordered a basic pepperoni pizza - the edges were burnt black and there was not much for sauce or cheese. The place was lively, the waiter was attentive except for serving a burnt edge pizza esp. when I enjoy the crust!!
August 15, 2014|Food|3|Disappointed in pizza ......my crust was soggy in center. No multigrain option. Atmosphere loud and noisy.
August 9, 2014|First Timers|5|This was our first time . The place came highly recommend and didn't disappoint. We were early for out 815 reservation and we seated right away corner table with a view of the street. This place is loud and busy so don't go if your looking for quiet and romantic. This is a place to have fun. We had the chicken wingstock as an appetizer and the meatball pizza which we added sausage to. Both were amazing. Waitstaff was great and always there when u needed them.
August 9, 2014|First time|4|"First time here. The wings were very good! Our server was awesome. The ""meatball pizza"" hardly had any meatballs on it, some slices didn't have any at all..... Will go back though"
August 8, 2014|Great Pizza Experience|5|We had the margherita pizza and salads with a nice pinot noir wine, and it was absolutely perfect. The pizza was homemade and very tasty. It was just enough for two people. I would highly recommend this dining experience.
August 2, 2014|Only one complaint|4|Had a wonderful meal. Yes, the wings are sooooooo good . Also o Ordered 4 pizzas for 8 of us which we thought would be too much, but we ate it all and they were all fantastic . Only complaint is the noise level we experienced on a Saturday night. Would not recommend for hard of hearing during a busy night at the restaurant.
July 28, 2014|great food, loud room|4|The pizza and salad are terrific, and the wait staff is professional and efficient. But it's a very hard room if you're with someone with any hearing issues.
July 24, 2014|Delicious!|5|Excellent chicken wings and pizza. Fun, lively atmosphere!
July 22, 2014|I love Pizza|3|This pizza was first rate. The crust was light but crunchy. The small pizza was perfect for 1 person. Toppings were fresh. The best pizza I've had in Providence. Are you listening Federal Hill?
July 18, 2014|Great food|5|App, soup, salad and pizza was great! Great selection of beer.
July 15, 2014|Pre-Show Venue|5|Absolutely the best wings and pizza any of us had ever had.....and this from a generally non-wings type of diners. It has to be the 900 degree oven because the end product is just so superior to any other iteration any of us have ever had. Located a block and a half from the Providence Performing Arts Center, it is a great pre-show option. They need to stay open later though. Consensus was to head straight back when the show was over around 11:00 PM, but when we got there, they were closed.
July 12, 2014|Repeat Pizza consumers|5|My husband and I dine frequently here at Coal Fired Pizza. The staff is welcoming and provides great service, the beverages are served up in a timely manner and we never feel rushed or forgotten. We LOVE the meatballs! I am a creature of habit and always order the Marguerite pizza....subtle flavors that meld beautifully with each other every time...never a miss.
July 5, 2014|Pizza and appetizers are very good here....|4|Pizza and appetizers are very good here. Although I like the place, it can be a bit loud in here. Otherwise a very good choice for pizza in Providence.
July 5, 2014|Why we go back ???????????|4|We,love the wings and pizza....always as good as anticipated. I like the valet parking, cut down on the hassle and we are always greeted by friendly people. The wait staff is normally excellent, sometimes a little slow but I am sure that depends on how busy they are. Overall we recommend it to friends and family.
June 28, 2014|Great Spot!|5|My fiance and I went on a date night before waterfire and it was excellent! The restaurant was not too busy and the service was very nice and quick. The food was absolutely delicious as well. I would definitely return!
June 28, 2014|This was our first vist here.  We ordere...|4|This was our first vist here. We ordered 3 different kinds of pizza and all were delicious. The crust was thin and cooked to perfection. The toppings were fresh. The meatball one was my favorite. The service was very good. The only complaint is the restaurant's noise level which made it almost impossible to hear each other without shouting. The decibel level was over the top and the restaurant was not at full capacity.
June 28, 2014|Best Pizza Ever!|4|My Fiancee and I enjoy good pizza and this place delivers it at its best. He believes it was the best pizza of his life and wants to go back (out of state) again this week. We had the ricotta cheese bread app and although it was much different than we thought, it far exceeded our expectations and we couldn't get enough of it. We had the margarita pizza and it was Delicious! We are looking forward to going back and trying the wings the people beside us got (they smelt amazing). Looking forward to trying another kind of pizza. Highly Recommend!
June 28, 2014|Great Pizza|5|Went with my husband and another couple pre-theatre. Three of the four of us are pizza connoisseurs and this was the best we've had. Ingredients are fresh and and very good quality. You won't be disappointed.
June 27, 2014|love the specialty pizzas!!!|5|met some friends the other night and just HAD to go with the specialty pizza (plus another favorite) of the night...so delicious! And the hummus is fresh and out of this world....our waiter was terrific too...really friendly and offered great suggestions and explanations of the menu items...he even brought us more flatbread to go along with the hummus since we had more people than the flatbread would take care of...all in all a great dinner with wonderful friends!
June 26, 2014|Great dinner with a large group|4|We had dinner with a group while attending an event at the convention center. It was an easy walk; service was friendly and efficient. Good beer selection. Try the pizza with local clams and fingerling potatoes!
June 23, 2014|Excellent Pizza|4|Really like this place. Went around 430 on a Monday and the place was almost empty... somewhat expected for that time of day. Was nice and relaxing... compared to my first visit here when the place was completely mobbed and you couldn't carry on a conversation with your tablemates. Had the ribs, wings and a pizza. All really excellent. OK wine by the glass rounded out the early dinner. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
June 20, 2014|Just OK|3|I went here on Friday night with my girlfriend as we have heard good things about it. Made a reservation which the honored with no problem and also had free valet parking as there was no street parking available. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. We ordered the Meatballs for an app and we got 3 golf ball sized meatballs for $8 dollars which were OK but in my opinion not worth $8. For our meal we ordered The Steak Bomb pizza which was tasty but not nearly enough food for 2 people. My advice; it's a good place if you're in a group a people and want to order a couple of pizzas to split and have some drinks after work but don't go there hungry.
June 18, 2014|"Who says pizza is ""just pizza""?"|5|What a great place to bring a friend that is not familiar with what Providence has to offer! Before a show at P PAC,or a P- Bruins game, I truly enjoy this wonderful restaurant!
June 15, 2014|Favorite spot in Providence.|5|Regular spot for us. Always good. We visit the city often for events and shows. The pizza and wings are great and the drinks are different and very good.
June 15, 2014|Delicious but not great value|4|Went there with a Groupon and family of 4, including two teenagers. Appetizers of meatballs,hummus plate,and tomato soup were all VERY GOOD.I didn't have the meatballs but my kids enjoyed them and liked the spicy sauce. I think there were only 3 in the order(maybe 4). We then all split a Margerhita Pizza and a Entrée Salad(Lentil and Hummus). The pizza was very good but not great. Thin,good crust but a bit pricey($15) for the size. Salad was also good. Overall the food was very good,the service was very good,the atmosphere was fine(Sunday early afternoon). Had hoped the pizza would have been a bit better and thought it was just a tad overpriced.
June 13, 2014|Great Brick Oven Pizza|4|The service was good, and the food was excellent. Very distinct flavor to the pizza and the wings (which were fabulous)! I think this is a great place to check out, and reasonably priced too.
June 4, 2014|Stellar food|5|Coal Fired Pizza manages to be fresh, unique, and delicious... pizza. Which is hard, in New England, with dozens of pizza places per city. Rivals Al Forno for the best in the area, and would compete favorably with Boston institutions like Regina's and Santarpio's.
May 31, 2014|Loud Bar but good beer|3|The pizzas were just ok. The crusts were not crisp and the mashup of toppings on the house selections did not produce a delight to the taste buds. There is better in the area. The crowd noise made hearing the person across the table difficult.
May 28, 2014|Wings and Ribs!|4|The coal fired wings and Ribs are my go to menu items every time. The wings are always cooked and seasoned perfectly and the Ribs are delicious and tender. Service is always great and accommodating.
May 23, 2014|Wonderful Restaurant|5|Providence Coal Fired Pizza was one of the first restaurants my wife and I visited, and loved, in Downcity, and we have been going there ever since. They have a wonderful beer and wine list, great service, and a very diverse (and creative) menu. If you enjoy unique pizzas with crispy crust, this is the place to go in Providence.
May 23, 2014|Great Food|5|The Pizza was wonderful and the wings are incredible. Great place that never disapoints our family......
May 23, 2014|Rocket pizza and the wings are the best!...|5|Rocket pizza and the wings are the best! Great service
May 16, 2014|Nice easy night out|4|Nice downtown spot. Great energy and staff. Salads, wings , and pizza all good. Pizza was a notch below Bob and Timmys, however the atmosphere made up for the difference. Valet car service makea the lack of parking issue obsolete. Great aftwr work dinner spot.
Dined on May 15, 2014|excellent pizza |4|1st time diner. went prior to a show at the PPAC, Arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation and was seated promptly. The restaurant was able to accommodate friends (who had a separate reservation) and seat us together. Honored a coupon we had even though they said it applied on theatre nights only. Now the food- Do not skip the wings!! Done in the Coal oven, with sea salt and rosemary- absolutely delicious. Pizza is thin crust, nicely done with just a hint of char. The Conrad was especially good and the margherita pizza was OK ( could use a bit more fresh mozzarella cheese for my taste). Overall the service was good and the food very good. Can't wait to return to have the wings again.
May 15, 2014|Great pizza|4|We went for dinner around 5:30 PM on a Thursday and we chose to sit outside. I noticed they were advertising $3 sangrias...so we got some. One red, one white. The white one was bland and not very tasty, so I asked the waiter to add some OJ or other juice to it. He came back with a much better mix. To start we ordered the famous chicken wings and they were DELICIOUS!!! Nice grilled wings with sweet caramelized onions....a winner anytime...We ordered a cheese pizza with their homemade sausage and it was very good. The crust was thin except on the edges, where it tends to be a bit thick. The sausage was tasty and delicious. Cheese and sauce were very flavorful too.
May 10, 2014|Good food; ambience lacking|3|Maybe it was bc I chose this place for a lg group recently and was second-guessing myself, but I noticed things that I hadnt noticed the first time I went there...There is virtually no music. The sound is just a *loud* din of people. I asked the bartender about it and she said the sound system was not quite installed right, and you really can't hear it, even if it is on. Bummer. Another thing I noticed is that the lights throughout the restaurant are bright--like it was 2am closing time. Not inviting. And it was hot inside. The food IS really good, but man, the ambience was NOT working for me last Sat night. Overall, I do highly recommend the food...and some of the ambience things can be addressed easily enough. :)
May 10, 2014|Excellent Spot|4|The place was packed with a pre-theater crowd when we arrived. When it's that busy it's EXTREMELY loud. Our 7pm reservation was honored on time. We enjoyed everything he had. Apps: Meatballs, Chicken Wings, Ribs. Pizza: Artichoke Special, Pepperoni. All the drinks from the bar were well made. There's a lot to like here. We noticed some of the pizzas coming out very charred, not what my son would appreciate... so we asked the waiter to have them keep an eye on that. Be careful to ask if that's a concern. We'll be back!
May 10, 2014|Pizza to die for|5|Been to Prov Coal Fired Pizza twice. Best thin crust pizza with the freshest topings and ingredients. Mixed drinks top notch.
May 8, 2014|Excellent place to dine|5|The food is fabulous. Love the meatball & ricotta pizza. Best chicken wings ever. Food is always delicious and very consistent. Took my mother there for the 1st time before a show and she loved it. Have been there several times. Service is always great. Place was packed. A little noisy but you forget about it. Highly recommend the Providence Coal Fired Pizza. Definitely will go back there.
May 3, 2014|Amazing Pizza!|5|Dined with a group and received excellent service. All pizzas were delicious - we had the Margherita, Conrad, and a Build Your Own. Good, thin crust and the pizza was not too cheesy. Would definitely return!!
May 2, 2014|Great food, ok everything else.|3|We are here before a show at PPAC this weekend. We had made a reservation, so were seated immeidately. The ambiance is cool...big, open space that's vey friendly. Plus you can watch them make the pizzas which is neat. I was SUPER bummed at the bar though....I ordered a mojito, which they put orange juice in. When I asked for no oj they said they can't do that...? Plus it was insanely expensive for drinks, even compared to other downtown places.
May 2, 2014|Great Pizza|4|Had a great dinner before seeing a show. The pizza was cooked perfectly, loved the margarita pizza - the sauce made it. The wings are a must try perfect balance of garlic and rosemary. As the night went on the place filled up I would recommend a reservation if you are pressed for time. Can't wait to go back.
May 2, 2014|Excellent pizza|5|Great find in providence. Great pizza ambience service and location. Really convenient to PPAC
April 30, 2014|Disappointing|2|"We have been to Coal Fired Pizza numerous times and food has always been excellent. The food was as good as ever but very slow in coming. The hostess started the night off by stating "" we will need the table back at 7"" as she was sitting us at our 5:30 PM reservation. If she had just asked she would have known that we were part of the pre-show crowd and the show started at 7PM. We did not realize we were renting table like a condo. Main course, our pizza was not delivered until 6:40, we had to rush so we could vacate table for show. We will never do a pre-show meal again, and we have season tickets."
April 30, 2014|Our server was fantastic. Friends arrive...|5|Our server was fantastic. Friends arrived unexpectantly . Our server got their food quickly and efficiently without a problem even though the restaurant was slammed before PPAC.
April 25, 2014|Great pizza before the show!|4|I had been to Providence Coal Fired Pizza once before and found the service and food somewhat lacking. This time around was a dramatic improvement. Our server was excellent! She was attentive and responsive but didn't hang around the table. We shared a caesar salad and margharita pizza. Both excellent. Nice vibe at Coal Fired pizza. Had a nice buzz but not too loud.
April 25, 2014|After work|5|Awesome wings as well as pizza, pepperoni and olive is my favorite, and a nice Palm, or two to drink, they use a cool spray on every glass before pouring from the tap. The staff are always friendly
April 24, 2014|Pizza pairs well with beer|5|We got the meat lovers special pizza- pairs incredibly with beer. Rosemary wings as an app are very good.
April 19, 2014|Best pizza and wings!|5|The wings are our favorite app! The specialty pizza tonight was asparagus, goat cheese and fingerling potato...amazing!
April 19, 2014|We had an event at the PPac theater and ...|4|We had an event at the PPac theater and heard about the Providence Coal Fired Pizza restaurant. The food was excellent and the service was good. They did not hurry us and gave us advice on what was very good. We would definitely go back.
April 19, 2014|Loved it!|5|Went before a show at Trinity and was FANTASTIC! Sat where they were prepping pizzas and close to server station which was fun. The chef that was adding toppings and cutting pizzas was very outgoing and friendly. For apps we had Ceaser Salad and meatballs served with wedges of pizza crust. Unbelievable flavor to the meatballs and sauce. Our pizza was a Margarita to which we added priscutto (sp) and carmelized onions. The crust was thin and had just the right crunch to it. It was great talking to the chef, watching the pizzas cook, and being in on some of the comeradiere and jokes of the staff. Can't wait for our return trip!!!!
April 18, 2014|One of my favs!!!!|5|Always a great time and the best pizza in Providence!!!!
April 17, 2014|Good Pizza|4|We're fans of New Haven Style Pizza, which is typically coal fired, so this place fits the bill. They make a good crust and some of their specialty pizzas are very good. Ingredients are top drawer. Good sauce, but not it's not on every pizza, so make sure you know what you're getting if that's a must-have. Also have to put in a word for the coal-fired wings. A real treat! Our experience with staff was very good two nights in a row. Don't forget to make a reservation on any Hockey or event night. you won't get in otherwise.
April 13, 2014|Really good pizza - upscale bar|4|Enjoyable meal. The Conrad - our pizza - was excellent. Loved the crust. Just the right size for two. Goat cheese appetizer with roasted vegetables was also delicious, and different from the ordinary appetizer. Beer and wine list was extensive - good choices and good recommendations from the waiter. A busy Sunday night made the restaurant seemed understaffed. The waiter was helpful and reasonably attentive, but there were times we were trying to find him. Clearly a place to go back to - especially when we attend Trinity Rep, which is a block away.
April 12, 2014|Kara Nichols|4|Atmosphere is great if you are looking for something more upbeat. It can be a bit noisy but not overbearing.
April 12, 2014|Food was great, service was|5|Food was great, service was great, we will be back!
April 12, 2014|Coal Fired Classic!|4|Had a great meal here with three friends. Perfect for a guys' night out. We shared the pizzas, all were very good. Satisfied this NYer (and self-proclaimed pizza snob). Definitely high on noise levels and energy. Not for a quiet romantic evening. Only complaint was that our server forgot to bring our drinks. Slight misstep but easily corrected. Host staff more than made up for it. Our hostess made some special accommodations for us (we were 20 mins late for rez) and kept our night on track. Highly recommended!
April 12, 2014|Casual pre-theater/event spot|4|Great pre-theater or Dunkin' Donuts center spot. Pizza is very good, menu is limited to just what they do well. My kids would have liked pasta on the menu, but they lived. Very busy & popular.
April 6, 2014|Great Pizza!|4|Amazing pizza with fresh ingredients. Service is always good and sitting at the bar is the best spot to be to watch the chefs in action
April 4, 2014|Regulars|5|Been here a bunch. Always great. Try the goat cheese app. Awesome
April 3, 2014|Good Eats!|4|This was my first time visiting this restaurant after the advice of a local patron that encouraged me to check it out. Great place to meet up with friends or go on a date. Although the acoustics of the place were more on the louder than quieter side, the ambience was pretty nice. Plenty of great beer available and awesome pizza! They use all fresh ingredients - no canned mushrooms or fake sausage slices here - this is the real deal. Excellent service! I would return again in the near future!!
April 2, 2014|Date night|5|Great food and drinks. Great service and they will get you out quick if you have an event to go to. Best pizza in the area. Fun place.
March 29, 2014|Love the food and service.|5|Love the food and service. I have been 5 times now with different friends and the food is consistently very good. Wings are my favorite (onions on the side) hummus is great too could use a bit more of the lemons and salsa sides, but really great and the pizza is different, being cooked in a coal fire vs brick oven.
March 22, 2014|Delicious goat cheese app...|4|This was probably my third time here, I always get the goat cheese flat bread appetizer; it is delicious! Pizza was awesome and our waitress Stephanie was very friendly. Looking forward to next time.
March 22, 2014|Great Pizza|5|Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Place was busy, we had reservations got seated immediately. Had wings for appetizer, so yummy! And we spilt a pizza. Plenty of food for 2
March 22, 2014|Make this your regular spot!|4|Had dinner at Coal fired pizza with family. The menu has something for everyone. The drinks are delicious the beer selection is great. Our server Stephanie was personable and on point. Make sure you check out this Providence Gem! The pizza is out of this world.
March 22, 2014|Super Hot!|5|That describes the pizza and our experience at this great pizza restaurant. The pizza, the primo calling card, was absolutely top of the line (And , at our age, we have partaken of many a pizza!!). The starters were superb--and to really make this a totally enjoyable evening after the theatre was our waiter. Josh just made the whole experience meld together into one unforgettable evening. No doubt we will return when we are again in Providence AND we have the added bonus of waiting for the opening of the next Providence Coal Fired Pizza in our hometown of North Kingstown. BUT, we will always look forward to coming to your establishment in providence and having Josh as our waiter again.
March 21, 2014|Still one of my favorites|5|Coal Fired is one of my favorite restaurants in Rhode Island. The special of the day is always interesting and the $2 Peroni's only make it better.
March 19, 2014|Fantastic!|4|Out of this world wings, lentil/hummus salad is like heaven and the pizzas are so flavorful and amazing. Service was great too and a ton of beers on tap. Will return on my next trip to Providence!
March 15, 2014|Denied|1|Providence Coal fired pizza did not honor our open table reservation! When we arrived for our 7:15 pm reservation they told us they would not seat us until 8:30 pm! They said open table had no business making our reservations! Even though we saw a few empty tables and only one group waiting to be seated. So we left!
March 15, 2014|Unique menu, fun atmosphere!|4|"We went on a recommendation of a friend, but still, we were thinking -- pizza and wings? Meh. But this was an excellent experience. The wings are unique -- not the same-old BBQ wings. With a combination of rosemary, onions and salt, they were delicious and they set the place apart. We were trying to decide how many to order, and the waiter said ""Trust me, if you eat one, you will eat five--they are that good."" And he was right. Loved the pizza! Lots of competition for pizza around, but it was a very respectable crust, small, thick-cut pepperoni. Just great. VVGood place!"
March 14, 2014|One of the best pizzas in prov|5|Great pizza! Greater wings! Service was better than perfect
March 14, 2014|A Fun Evening|4|After having spent 2 hours on Urbanspoon and Yelp to find a nice semi-casual restaurant for my wife's 36th birthday and two of our closest friends I settled on Providence Coal Fired Pizza. I don't typically dine in Providence, so the complementary valet parking was a great start to the evening. The food was outstanding. The waiter brought us some homemade sausage in a cabbage wrap which was different but delicious. We ordered the ricotta cheese dip with the flat bread for an appetizer that was so delicious, we ordered a second one when our friends arrived. My wife and I ordered a sausage pizza, and our friends ordered some of their wings to share. Both dishes were absolutely delicious.
Dined on March 12, 2014|Good Pizza in Providence|4|I was intrigued by the use of a coal fired oven. Could it be as good as the New Have places (Frank Pepe's)? Well it was pretty darn good. Just the right amount of char, and a very light dough. A simple red sauce and fresh mozarella and basil on my Pizza Margherita (I am a pizza purist). I will return.
March 10, 2014|Good specials|4|Good specials each night. Particularly like Mondays with half-price margherita pizzas and $3 margaritas. Ended up straying from my usual and getting a baby bella. Loved the cheese but I'm not a big fan of the mushrooms. Otherwise great pizzas. Definitely get the wings.
March 10, 2014|Best Pizza in Town|5|Title says it all -- always our go-to place for pizza. Thin crust, good quality ingredients and the right oven makes all the difference. We live in one of the best restaurant cities and are foodies...but we end up here more often than not!
March 9, 2014|Great As Always|5|Consistently good food and service. The wings are awesome; the pizza dough is light and airy. Always busy--make a reservation!
March 8, 2014|The food was top notch. Had|5|The food was top notch. Had the lentil and hummus salad and I'm still craving more
March 8, 2014|This is by far my favorite|5|This is by far my favorite restaurant in Providence. The food can't be beat. The wings, pizza and butterscotch pudding are the best!
March 8, 2014|Great time at PVD Coal Fired Pizza|4|A friend recommended this restaurant after raving about the pizza. I decided to try it with my husband and some friends and I was not disappointed. The food was excellent, the service was great and the atmosphere was cozy. I will definitely be back!
March 4, 2014|brew and pizza|4|Beer selection was very good. Wings were outstanding. One of the pizzas crust was so thin, you could not pick any up along with a little too much sauce. The other was excellent. Both lizzas tasted outstanding.
March 4, 2014|Hit or Miss|3|The appetizers are good, but the portions are small. The pizza crust is a bit too hard for my liking. It's difficult to bite or cut into.
March 1, 2014|Awesome Pizza|4|Had a quick pizza and salad before the theater and were pleasantly surprised by the delicious pizza! The casual, sports bar atmosphere makes it good for groups.
February 27, 2014|We had a great dinner before|4|We had a great dinner before going to PPAC and we had 3 generations in our group of 6. Prov Coal Fired Pizza fit the bill perfectly - the pizza was excellent and the varied choices for toppings/styles made it different than just going out for pizza. The salads were especially good - fresh, great dressing, and high quality. The beer and wine list was also nice... Our waiter was patient with our 2 older members of the group who were worried about getting to the play on time and was very responsive to our needs. Would definitely go again!
February 27, 2014|The Rocket!|4|The Rocket was delicious! Will definitely order it again.
February 25, 2014|good, but . . .|3|Very conveni.ent to PPAC and pizza and appetizer was tasty. Waiter courteous, but forgot drink order, placed wrong pizza order and had to have pizza redone and didn't seem to listen to one particular person.That person was on a medical restrictive diet and there was NOTHING for her to eat. Asked for vegetable garden salad and was mostly lettuce. Included with lettuce a few strips of red onion, 1 slice of cuke cut in fourths and 2 cherry (little) tomatoes cut in half. When asked for raw vegies,waiter came back with a carmelized vegies dish w/ bread Patron still could not eat that. Was charged for everything though with no break in all the mistakes. Probably good for just pizza or appetizer, but if want anything else not good.
February 22, 2014|Loved it|5|We had theater tickets close by and let our server know that when she first came to our table. We ordered a great bottle of wine and lingered over it then placed our order. Everything arrived at an appropriate pace even though the place was packed. Food was also great. We paid our check with plenty of time to walk to the theater before the show...never rushed, never ignored. Thanks for a wonderful experience!
February 21, 2014|Going back...|5|The food was wonderful, by all accounts. The server, Stephanie, was fun, amiable and very helpful. My only complaint is that I have Celiac Disease and they do not have any gluten-free pizza. Stephanie knew what Celiac Disease was and was very helpful when I ordered. The wings were spectacular and she made sure that they were made gluten-free. Although I realize that they can't make gluten-free pizza in an oven that has had flour in it, I just have to wonder if they could offer a gluten-free option; even if it wasn't cooked in the coal-fired oven. That being said, I would still go back. I would recommend that you make a reservation if you are going on a Friday or Saturday night.
February 21, 2014|PCFP Never Disappoints!|5|Everything about the evening was great! The wings - as always - were out of this world. Cocktails were top-notch and beyond the ordinary. All of our pizzas were served piping hot and exactly as ordered. Plenty of time to enjoy our meals and still make our show at PPAC. Never felt rushed!
February 17, 2014|Best Pizza in a top foodie city|5|This is our go-to place for pizza -- and we've been pizza fans in many places, including Italy. Yet we always come back to this one as our favorite. Crisp crust, fresh tomato sauce, fantastic pepperoni (if you like that) in a coal-fired oven that gives it just the right crusty, charred taste. Good service, friendly, engaging -- remembered us after a couple of visits. I bring my own soda (because I'm not a Coke fan) and they've never given me grief about that, which I appreciate. It is often crowded (other people know a good place too!).Parking downtown is a pain unless you're willing to pay for it (and we are too cheap for that)....but they have valet parking at busy times.
February 16, 2014|Open table messed up. After|4|Open table messed up. After a confirmation being made, when we arrived at the restaurant they did not have my reservation. However, the restaurant found us two seats at the pizza bar and offered us desserts. Hostess was great. Waiter terrific and good excellent. We love the place especially before theater.
February 16, 2014|Great food; spotty service|3|Food was terrific! Had the Hummus and Lentil salad and the Margherita Pizza and the Conrad. Fabulous. Also great Ceasar Salad. Waitress was not very responsive and very forgetful. Asked for salads first but she brought them at the same time as the pizza (except for my salad which was my dinner and came when everyone else at the table was finished). Had to remind her twice that we ordered some beverages. Finally, we decided to forget about it and never got soda refills. When we told her, she didn't offer to bring it anyway even though she made excuses for forgetting to bring them twice. Tables did not have much room for all of the plates, etc. and waitress did not clear. Unfortunate since food was so great!
February 14, 2014|Well worth a visit|5|Maybe not the most romantic place for a Valentine's Day dinner but my wife and I loved it. Starting with efficient valet service to prompt seating to an outstanding meal it was a great time. As other reviewers have said, the wings are out of this world. We ordered a large order anticipating bringing some home. We ate them all and ordered a small order to go. The pizza, rabes and sausage, was excellent with perfectly cooked crust. Our sever was very good--friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We plan on returning Friday night after the PC hockey game.
February 14, 2014|pizza at its best|5|We started with the chicken wings with onions.They were out standing. We also had the goat cheese with roasted vegetables. Wow.. Over the top! Then on to the pizza we tried 3 different types and all were the best pizza ever. Crunchy chewy crust. Sauce was just how I like it no chuncks. Just smooth tasty sauce. Now on to the service from the valet to the person opening the door to our waitress were wonderful. I just want to express how knowledgeable our waitress was.So helpful.Wonderful night and we will be back many times.
February 12, 2014|Service and food were excellent!|5|Service and food were excellent! Host, waitstaff and cook staff all did a wonderful job!
February 9, 2014|This was our second time to|4|This was our second time to this restaurant. Previously I did not make reservations so we ended up eating at the bar, which was actually quite interesting because the pizzas were prepared and cooked within view. The gourmet pizza choices are interesting, but delightful. We tried the evening special with a shrimp topping. It was tasty. I could have eaten more. Draft beer selections are varied, but not a big list. I was pleased our reserved table was ready when we arrived on time.
February 8, 2014|Pre-PPAC|5|Location perfect for pre-PPAC dinner. Food was terrific, particularly the chicken wings which were out of this world. The good news is that it was very busy for a Saturday night in Providence in that location so business is good. The bad news is that it was very noisy. Would not hesitate to go back again though.
February 8, 2014|Dinner before show|4|Service was excellent. I will request Stephanie the next time I go. She was attentive and offered some great suggestions for wine and food. The chicken wings are excellent as was the lentil and hummus salad. The pizza is very good and was more than enough for 3 people to share.
February 2, 2014|Good Pizza but Expensive|3|The two of us ordered a couple of salads, two drinks each and a pizza to share. The food was good. However, the bill came to over $90 with the tip. This is much too expensive for salad and pizza.
February 1, 2014|Great Pizza and Salads!|3|What it does-it does well….pizza is awesome…really great crust! Hummus and lentil salad is also fantastic. Tables are a little too small for such big pizzas, menus are often dirty…but for your basic pizza place-this place makes good pies! Oh and it is crazy busy!
January 30, 2014|Warm on a cold winter's night|5|Sat at the dining bar around the coal fired pizza oven watching the pizzas being made, enjoyed some great pizza. Crust is crispy and they are generous with the toppings. For 5 of us, we ordered 3 pizzas - meatball and ricotta, margarita and sausage and olives, and had some left over to bring home. Yeah, we were a bit conservative with the toppings, but the choices are plentiful! Next time we are trying the margarita with arugula!! We made a reservation for 5:30 on a Thursday night, but didn't really need one -- however, by 6 or so, the place was jammin'!
January 29, 2014|Great food, lousy service|3|The food was great, service wasn't. We were seated and told that Name Withheld would be with us shortly. We waited for about ten minutes and saw other tables around us being seated and having their drink orders taken. I approached the hostess and she sent our waiter right over. No big deal, it happens. He apologized. Our second round of drinks I changed my cocktail to a glass of wine, but he still brought the cocktail - and it wasn't even the same one I had first ordered, and he forgot a glass of wine for my mom. I told him I would drink mine, but we still needed my Mom's wine. When the bill came, the cocktail I hadn't ordered was still on the bill. He was gruff and rude but acquiesced and removed it. I still gave him 25%.
January 29, 2014|Great for group!|4|Our Mom's group went before a PPAC show. Was a great place for Pizza and drinks pre-show!!
January 23, 2014|Awesome as Usual!|5|Great food as always and Jennifer behind the bar is one of the best bartenders/servers around. This is one of my favorite restuarants and never lets me down. I can't wait for my next return trip!!!!
January 18, 2014|Fun spot and good food|4|We went here on a Saturday night with friends. The pizzas are very very good and are reason enough to come eat here without considering anything else. We also tried the hummus appetizer, which didn't come with enough bread. The server offered to bring us more, but it was so slow in coming that by the time it arrived we had already had them take away the hummus plate to make room for the pizzas. (The tables are a little too small, really, for the pizzas - they use metal stands to hold the pizzas up off the table, but it's still too cramped). Our server was attentive throughout our meal but there was a lot of confusion as the staff kept bringing other people's orders to our table by mistake. Also - the restaurant is pretty loud.
January 18, 2014|Good Providence Night Out Option|4|We had tickets to a PC basketball game, and gave Coal Fired Pizza a try for dinner before the game. It's got a great location for most of the downtown attractions. The atmosphere is lively, but not so much so that you can't hold a conversation. The service was prompt and courteous, and the drinks and food came without a long wait. I had a glass of Malbec that was probably the best I've tasted, and it was only $8.00! I liked it enough to write down the name. The pizza is the thin crust type, nice and hot & crispy. If you like the thicker crust, Greek style, this isn't the place for you. My only complaint was they put WAY too much arugala on it. I had to pick a lot of it off. Overall, a good option for dinner before an event downtown.
January 17, 2014|Excellent Pizza!|5|This place has an excellent selection of brick oven pizza that are absolutely delicious. Thin crispy crust and delicious fresh toppings. The place itself is very new and has two decent size half circle bars and plenty of tables. There is valet parking and plenty of parking lots right next to the restaurant, but be warned that they are not free and range from $8-12 (cash only). Other than the parking I would highly recommend this restaurant.
January 17, 2014|Obsessed with Reservations|3|Offer you the ability to make an online reservation. This is so you don't have to make a phone call. Then they call you to confirm the reservation and request that you return the phone call. Then they are rude on the phone, of course after just hanging up on you because the only phone they have is in the middle of a marching band. Finally, when you arrive, the valet won't even open your car door unless you answer his question of whether or not you've made a reservation. You serve pizza! Get over yourself! Food is great, wait staff is great. Your hostess staff are a bunch of snobby little girls and your obsession with a reservation is insane! I will be back but really all in all, WTF!
January 17, 2014|Love it!|5|We love going to Providence Coal Fire Pizza on Friday date night or before any show/event downtown. It is centrally located between PPAC, Trinity, the Dunk, etc. The food is always yummy!
January 11, 2014|Great as always|5|Had another excellent meal at Coal Fired Pizza. Their special pizza that night had cauliflower, bacon, cheddar, onions, and garlic oil and it was amazing.
January 10, 2014|Great food, but very loud|3|We had a 730 reservation on a Friday night. This was our first time there and we were disappointed by how loud it was. Not q place to go if you want to have a quiet dinner, but I could see going with a group of people. The food (wings and meatball pizza) and service were great.
January 8, 2014|Service|4|Great pizza and drinks. The service was quite slow and rarely has our server attend to us.
January 4, 2014|good pizza, really loud|4|we sat at the table nearest the door on a very cold night. Oddly, it was so hot where we sat that we all had to take of every layer but one. I kid you not when I tell you we could easily have been in our bathing suits and been plenty warm enough. Really, that needs to get fixed. The pizza...as you would expect...were very tasty and perfectly cooked. A single pizza is plenty for two...maybe even three if you're modest eaters or you have a side dish. Peperoni, Broccoli Rabe and Clam pizzas were all excellent. Caution: eat the clam pizza first...it get soggy after a while. Fun atmosphere, nice decor, VERY loud on a Saturday night. Shouting across the table kinda loud.
Dined on December 31, 2013|Theater Crunch|2|"We arrived at the restaurant 1 hr and 20 minutes before the show at PPAC. I informed the waitress that we needed to attend the performance and her only response was, ""You and everyone else here."" Seemed to me to be a bit inappropriate. We had my 5 year-old granddaughter with us. We ordered drinks that came within a reasonable time frame.We ordered the goat cheese appetizer and a large pizza. The appetizer was not brought to the table until nearly 30 minutes after we ordered and the pizza took 40 minutes before we got it. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the server (explaining that we realize she wasn't to blame). and she had no response. When she brought the pizza she took away my app plate and never brought one back for my pizza.."
December 29, 2013|BEST NEW SPOT IN PROV RI|5|GREAT PIZZA AND WINGS. SERVICE TERRIFIC, AND GREAT FOR FAMILIES
December 26, 2013|We arrived during a rush so|3|We arrived during a rush so glad we had a reservation. Service was slower than usual due to the rush and the noise level made it difficult to hear at the table. However, once some of the tables cleared the service improved as did the noise level. Great neighborhood spot and close to lots of fun things to do downtown.
December 26, 2013|It's too loud. The pizza was|3|It's too loud. The pizza was over cooked. The service was ok
December 21, 2013|Much More Than a Sports Bar|4|Don't be put off by the TV screens around the high ceilinged room and the lively bar scene at the back of the restaurant. This is definitely a good place to get reasonably priced salads and appetizers, better-than-average pizza, and dessert. We enjoyed our coal-fired pizza (chewy, charred crust) with two different cheeses, mushrooms, and roasted onions, along with a delicious hummus appetizer (served with very tasty and chewy pita-like bread), a fresh salad (mostly fresh greens), and a very good chocolate mousse. All in all, this was a nice way to sample some good food at reasonable prices, all served up by friendly staff. We'd dwefinitely come back!
December 20, 2013|Coal fired|4|The come-on for this place is its offer of coal-fired pizza. The crust was burned, but the filling was very good. I could not discern much difference between coal-fired and pizza done in a hot flaming oven. The nose level was very high but the patrons were lively and seem quite happy being there.
December 18, 2013|Not the best..Not the worst|3|Web-site drink menu notes Budweiser, but they do not actually have it. Service was a tad slow and not very friendly. Food was okay, but nothing to write home about. Wings were delicious while pizzas were just okay. Clam pizza was loaded with potatoes and not enough clams.
December 15, 2013|Went with our three young|4|Went with our three young children before a show at PPAC with a 5:15 reservation. The restaurant was busy but we were seated upon arrival and service was friendly but slow. Chicken wings (not spicy) and pizza were very good. Would happily return.
December 13, 2013|First Time|5|This was my first experience at this restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere and close proximity to the Trinity Rep theater. The service was very good and I thought the food was excellent.
December 12, 2013|First Time|5|Very impressed. The chicken wings, which were highly recommended, were excellent. The pizza was great as well, slightly blackened but still chewy! Nice beer selection for a pizza restaurant. The atmosphere was great. We were trying to figure out what was in the building before.
December 6, 2013|great for pre theater dining|5|dined here before a show at PPAC. service was prompt and professional. those coal fired pizzas come out quickly; plenty of time to walk to PPAC and make your show. full bar with fresh made cosmos. my group had teenagers who found apps and pizzas that they enjoyed. you can tell that everything is fresh made as advertised. excellent pre theater spot for a younger crowd. I booked through open table; reservation was ready when we arrived. nose level just from general conversation was high due to the acoustics, but that added to the lively atmosphere.
December 6, 2013|Delicious !|5|"The chicken wings are the best I have ever tasted. They are smothered in onions and a dry rub. The arugula salad was perfect and the ""Conrad"" pizza as good as it gets!"
December 4, 2013|Dinner and show|5|This is a great place to go before a show. It also appears to be stopping ground after work so it is busy. Make sure to make a reservation. The server was very attentive and Helpful with suggestions. Make sure to tell them you are going to and they will plan accordingly.
December 4, 2013|Providence HOT spot|4|This place was hopping on a Wednesday. Lots happening downtown that night. Glad we made a reservation.
December 1, 2013|Great concept & outstanding pizza!|4|This is an excellent place to go before or after a show at PPAC. The pizza is amazing! All fresh ingredients with a delicious crust. The salads are good too.

November 29, 2013|Great place|5|Pizza was great! Ricotta app was unbelievable. Service was top notch with a cool atmosphere.
November 29, 2013|Good pizza|4|Pizza and service was very goog. Pizza was a bit over cooked on the crust edges, but still very good.
November 27, 2013|Always excellent|5|Coal Fired is one of the most consistent restaurants I've ever gone too. I would recommend it to anyone. The soup, the wings, and the pizza are all outstanding.
November 23, 2013|pricey but yummy pizza|3|The pizza was very good so kudos to the chef, however, the prices are a bit high considering its pizza. The service could have been better too... had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated even tho we made this reservation. The bar drinks were very good too.
November 23, 2013|Love the pizza and beer selection|4|Great pizza and beer selection, but the acoustics are bad- it's all hard surfaces and even at lunch when the restaurant was only half full, it was still hard to hear my husband over the echos from other people conversing. I've been when it's packed on a Friday night and it's an ok place for a group as long as you don't mind being restricted to conversing with the person directly next to you in exchanged shouts!
November 22, 2013|Weird music|3|The pizza was good, but the music was a strange mix of pleasant oldies and really bad pop.
November 17, 2013|Definitely go again...outstanding|5|Definitely go again...outstanding pizza, great atmosphere, excellent selection
November 8, 2013|A great value for downtown|4|Excellent quality food and service made for a very pleasant experience.
November 2, 2013|First time. Pizza and wings|5|First time. Pizza and wings were excellent. Service was terrific. Had a reservation for 10 people that was easily accommodated in a high top table. If you want a regular table make the request with your reservation.
November 2, 2013|Great food and very accommodating!|5|I had a reservation for 5 people, but plans changed and we now had 11. They were at full capacity, but worked us in and called me to fit our large party at the last minute. Great food, atmosphere, service and complimentary valet parking! True gem in Providence!
November 1, 2013|pre-PPAC pizza perfection|5|Needed a place to meet friends for a casual meal before a PPAC show. Location was key, so we decided on Providence Coal-Fired Pizza. Friendly staff, great service. Good wine list, and very tasty, creative pizzas. Reasonable prices. Fun, family-friendly environment with the right amount of noise to make you feel like everyone's havin a good time. Excellent location for an under-five-minute walk to PPAC. Free valet parking at restaurant door, good for the duration of the show. Would definitely return, show or not.
November 1, 2013|Great find!!|5|My friend and I were taking in a show in Providence and I heard about Coal Fired Pizza from someone who had been and enjoyed it. My friend and I loved the food! The wings were to die for and the pizza was fab! I have already told friends and family about how much we loved it and would definitely would go back. The hostess was nice enough to call a cab for us and when the cab was running late she called again and made sure we were taken care of even though it was super busy inside. 10/10!!
October 27, 2013|A Pleasant Change|4|We've be here several times and it is a nice change from the run of the mill pizza parlors. The architecture of the place is great, the food is unique, and it is a great place to people watch.
October 26, 2013|excellent pizza|4|This restaurant serves unique and excellent pizza. The wings are also outstanding. Gets very crowded so make a reservation, especially on a Saturday night during theater season
October 18, 2013|Very good|4|In for Parents Weekend and found this online and decided to try it out based on the reviews. It was crowded but food was very good as was service. Definitely will go back.
October 18, 2013|Great Pre-Game Dinner!|5|We made a reservation at Providence Coal Fired Pizza for dinner before a P Bruins game. I noted in my online reservation form that we needed to be in and out within an hour so that we wouldn't be late for the game. We received a friendly greeting when we checked in, and the hostess informed our server of the time requirements. Our server came right to our table and allowed us to order right away to keep to our schedule. We ordered the house wings. They were delicious!!! Just the right amount of seasoning, and covered in caramelized onions. The pizza was delicious! Our only comment is that the crust was not as crisp as we would like; but we still ate every bite of it! And, it is loud in there, but not intrusive. We cannot wait to go back!
October 14, 2013|Thoughtful menu|4|A pizza restaurant for carb watchers- great salads- I returned twice for the lentil salad- had the vegan version. Pizza great for those growing up in Italian homes - felt real. Very good wine selections
October 13, 2013|We loved the pizzas - very|3|We loved the pizzas - very delicious and not ur everyday boring tastes. The only thing we didn't like too much, was the fact, that there was nothing else as an entree. If you have someone in your party that doesn't want to eat pizza, they are out of luck. Not very child wil love those speciality pizzas either. Service was quick and friendly too. Wine list is ok.
October 12, 2013|Very good pizza. Members of|4|Very good pizza. Members of my party enjoyed the wings. Fun atmosphere. Valet parking on the weekend is a great bonus.
October 6, 2013|The restaurant was packed|4|The restaurant was packed with a good vibe. The food was delicious and served quickly...what more could someone want!
October 2, 2013|Great Pizza|4|A lively spot with good service and great pizza. Took the family (kids & grandkids) and everyone had a great time. The roasted goat cheese was wonderful, the pizza even better.
October 1, 2013|best pizza in town|5|As always the food and atmosphere was great, the service was impeccable and as the title says...THE BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!!!
October 1, 2013|What happened?|2|Hve dined here before but this was a big disappointment. Appetizer was served with our pizza, ribs were dry and over-cooked, pizza was burnt. Not sure we'll ever go back.
September 29, 2013|Food is the Attraction|4|A young vibe here. Lots of energy. Pizza is different and very good. A friend recommended the wings, which were also different from any others I have had and very good. Service is good for a pizza place - informal but reasonably attentive.
Dined on September 27, 2013|okay experience|2|the food was amazing! the service we experienced was HORRIBLE! when i sent the restaurant an email regarding my negative experience, i never received a response. clearly they do not care about customer retention. not coming back thats for sure.
September 20, 2013|great food...questionable service.|4|The food was fantastic, though the time it took to receive it was lengthy (we sat at 8:15, and did not receive our entrees until well after 9:15pm).
September 14, 2013|Pre-theater dinner|4|I made reservations for a table before going to the theater, to make sure we would have enough time. This was my first time at Providence Coal Fired Pizza, but I'd heard good things. The food was excellent, as was the service. The crowd was really mixed, with a lot of people at the bar, but families and mixed groups at the tables. The prices are very reasonable for the location.
September 7, 2013|Great|5|This was my first time at Providence coal fire pizza and it did not disappoint. We started with the coal fired chicken wings and crispy bread with goat cheese and marinara sauce, both were great. The wings were simple, but cooked to perfection with a great coal char and topped with grilled onions. The bread was great, especially when dipped in the chunky marinara and goat cheese. For dinner, we opted for the The Conrad, which had roasted peppers and onions and sausage made in house. The pizza was phenomenal, the crust was perfect, cheese and toppings made it even better. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, it's also located in a nice neighborhood and a close walk to the Providence Water fires if you're there on a Saturday.
September 7, 2013|Great food at PVD Coal Fired Pizza|5|We headed to Providence Coal Fired Pizza before going to Waterfires. Our party consisted of two adults and three children. I had made a 7pm reservation, but they were kindly able to seat us earlier. As the previous reviews suggested, we ordered the chicken wings app and the baked goat cheese app. Both were delicious! When the two pizzas for the table arrived, they were tasty as well, and we were able to finish off the last of the goat cheese with our pizza crusts. Heavenly! Tom, our waiter, was attentive but not overbearing. It was a bit noisy, but we'll definitely be back!
August 24, 2013|Great pizza|5|Really enjoyed the pizza. We had the rocket and a pepperoni pizza. It reminded us of Lombardi's in NYC which is one of our all time favorites. We were a bi shocked that our total bill ended up being more $ than we expected but we decided it was worth it. Going back for more.
August 22, 2013|We love coal fired pizza.|5|We love coal fired pizza. The wings and hummus are so delicious. Tried the hamburg pizza...it was so very yummy and as always we got the Conrad, which also was delicious. Our waiter was a bit non interested and slow in getting stuff to us, but the young man who brought the pizza was very helpful and pleasant. We'll be back again
August 17, 2013|Great Pizza!|4|Loved the pizza and the apps and drinks. Would return!
August 10, 2013|WHAT???|3|I found the noise level near unbearable, the service adequate and the food good, not great. I may go back but I wouldn't make any special effort to do so.
August 4, 2013|superior pizza|5|i make it my mission to eat pizza and be critical about it; simple visual inspection suffices to tell that this is a superior pizza. blackened, chewy crust, crispy bottom, judicious application of toppings. we went here two nights in a row.
August 3, 2013|Quack & Clam|5|We couldn't decide what to get, so our waiter said, go half & half. The duck pizza is crazy good, & the clam pizza is all the best parts of a clam bake. Can't wait to go back.
August 3, 2013|Not so enthusiastic the second time|2|"So this was my second visit. First time with just a few friends on a weeknight. Liked the food, thought service was a bit indifferent. This time was on a Sat evening with family, including my elderly mother. My biggest complaint was the noise level- pretty ridicoulously loud. The server was kind enough to turn down the music and that helped but we were shouting to have a conversation. I did enjoy the wings and pizza but my familyy was not as impressed as I had been and thought it was pretty pricey for what you got. Service, while not indifferent, at least not all that attentive. There was no problem getting served, it's just lack of the"" how are you doing, how was everything"" checking in with diners."
July 27, 2013|Birthday celebration|5|Celebrated my 36th birthday here over the weekend and it was great. Service was friendly, good excellent. My friends, some of them serious foodies, and I like it a lot. Would go again.
July 22, 2013|Food good, service just ok.|3|Loved the goat cheese app and the coal fired wings. Pizza a bit over cooked but tasty. Service a bit on the indifferent side but the food would bring me back at least for one more time.
July 10, 2013|Had great mushroom pizza and|4|Had great mushroom pizza and very fresh salad with tasty dressing -- would gladly try this again.
July 9, 2013|Overcooked Pizza|4|I've been to coal-fired pizza several times. My opinion is that it prepares the best pizza in Providence. However, this time the pizza was well overdone. The server was not responsive.
June 29, 2013|Outstanding|5|Love the pizza and the wings were GREAT. Can't wait to go back . Only thing that was better then the food was the service .
June 23, 2013|Dinner for 10|5|"We were dining pre-Trinity Rep on a Sunday evening. The food and wine were excellent and the staff very accomodating. There were 10 of us asking for 4 separate checks which is a challenge for wait staff. They were accomodating and pleasant about our requests, kept the drink orders up to speed and managed to get 7 of their generous sized pizzas on our tables. My only ""complaint"" ---and it is not realy a complaint---is that the tables were all square so we were seated in a long line and visiting was difficult. But that is the situation many places, We would have liked to be outside and it would have fit us but two of the tables were reserved. Inside was very nice, however."
June 23, 2013|Happy with our experience|4|I brought my family to Coal Fired Pizza after my daughter's dance recital. We had two kids, two seniors, and two adults in tow. All of us were pleased with our meals (we split three different pizzas). We were especially pleased with our server, Tom, who was funny, helpful, and attentive without being over-bearing. All in all, we were all very happy with our experience.
June 22, 2013|Delicious!|5|We always look forward to going here for pizza and the wings! Tonight we had the Bianca as well as an order of wings. The red sangria was perfect! Our waitress Kelly was knowledgable about the food and beverages. She was attentive to us but not intrusive...which earned her a tip that was over 20%. Always a good time!
June 21, 2013|Fun night, great pizza|5|Food was delicious, pizza crust was perfect Loved the décor and set-up, but a bit loud due to a screaming baby, otherwise, great night.
June 7, 2013|Great Pizza and Ribs|4|Great food! We sat at the bar and watched the pizza being made. Only disappointment is they don't have much on the dessert choices.....
June 7, 2013|Wonderful for a night at PPAC!|4|We had pizza and wings - both delicious! We were able to valet park and go see the show.
June 7, 2013|Pre show dining|3|We enjoyed our dinner.and it is a great location for dinner before the PPAC or Trinith Rep.Convenient walk and parking. we didn't know there was a per show special For$49.00,but. Next time we will take advantage of that.
June 6, 2013|It took over an hour for our|4|It took over an hour for our pizza to arrive which seems to be a bit long to me. Otherwise, excellent food!
June 5, 2013|Great for dinner before show|5|We has seen Coal Fire when leaving a PPAC preformace and decided to try at next show because of it convienance. This is not your ordinary pizza place. The atmosphere is fresh and exciting just like the food. The service was great and quick. Just food options to satisfy everyone at the table. We loved the warm goat cheese surrounded by roasted veggie appetizer and the arrugala and prociutto salad was large enough to split. The pizzas were a thin crust that was cooked to prerfection. The add to it there was free valet parking. Will definately be going back, even when there is no show.

May 24, 2013|Small but effective menu|5|I've been to Providence Coal Fired Pizza four times now and I have to say, every time is just as good as the last. Their dry rub chicken wings are perfect, and each pizza I've had has excellent toppings. Their tomato soup is wonderful as well.
May 23, 2013|Good wing!|4|The wings are great. The menu online was not the menu at the Resturant. Was looking forward to the cheese plate.
May 19, 2013|yummy|4|Just returned from the restaurant with the taste of goats cheese on my mind. It was fabulous. Jason was an excellent waiter, the pizza was fabulous, the chicken wings are as good as everyone says they are, and the drinks were generous. There were 10 of us (2 kids) celebrating a 1st Communion. We were seated right away, the food was hot and fast, and we watched the Bruins play out of the corner of our eyes. Excellent experience and will go again.

May 16, 2013|Very good pizza in a pizza town|4|We were very impressed on our first visit here with the food and the service. the ambiance is sort of bar and pub like, which is fine if you're prepared for that, and it's loud (we were there when a Stanley Cup playoff game was on); the pizzas were excellent - as described, they're thin crust, with the right number of blistered spots, well seasoned and prepped toppings - delicious! The salads were a pleasant surprise - lots of care into the prep and presentation and the quality of the greens was A plus - didnt expect that at a pizza place. I have recommended to a number of people, even non meat pizza fans!
May 12, 2013|Fun & Friendly|5|"My new ""go-to"" restaurant. Perfect for small groups. Everybody orders and then shares. Everything cooked to order, nice and fresh. Wings are delish....straight out of oven. Love the coal-fired experience."

May 11, 2013|Delicious food|4|"I had a reservation for a group of 6 and we got 3 pizzas, which was just perfect (only one piece left). The meatball pizza's crust was soggy, but that was the only negative about the food. The pizza with the mushroom and truffle oil was fantastic, as was the pizza with the arugula. We didn't get appetizers but the baked goat cheese sounded phenomenal. Parking can be a real issue though they do have ""complimentary"" valet parking (I gave the valet attendant a $5 tip). It's kind of in an odd location around the corner from a gentleman's club. Overall I would say it was a great experience and I'd go back."
May 9, 2013|Lots of Potential|3|Overall the atmosphere is good for a pizza/bar restaurant. Pizza was good (a 6 on a 1-10 scale), but a bit burnt on the crust. Also a tad bit more topping would improve the pizza in my opinion. However the salad was very, fresh and a good size. A must have!
May 6, 2013|ohhh the wings!|3|The pizza is great...tender crust, crunchy an chewy, fresh herbs. But the unsung hero is the wings. Even vegetarians succumb to them. You can taste the rosemary and they are not greasy . They would be truly decadent with something to plant the onions on.
May 3, 2013|"Good pizza

Dined on April 27, 2013|The food was excellent, but|1|The food was excellent, but the staff were unfriendly and poor communicators. Additionally, it was so loud that we couldn't hear one another speaking from right across the table. I'd love to get take-out next time because the food was so good, but I don't think I'll be able to tolerate the restaurant itself again.
April 27, 2013|fun hip place to eat|4|I have been there twice and both times have been very good. I recommend the wings, the goat cheese app and the pizzas are excellent. Get there early on the weekends and the noise level is very high. Tom, our waiter both times, was very informative and friendly.
April 26, 2013|Sit at the kitchen bar to|4|Sit at the kitchen bar to watch all the action. Sit at the end nearest the kitchen to catch all the banter between the waitstaff and the pizza chefs...it's great free entertainment.

The noise level was really high, from the music but also other chatter...and the restaurant wasn't even full. It was perhaps not the best choice for a social business meeting.
April 22, 2013|Good for adults and their kids|4|This was a good place to go on a weeknight with adults who like decent food and a child who doesn't like a lot. The pizzas seemed a little expensive, but they were tasty, as were the salads. This was a nice find to add to our list of everyday restaurants in Providence. The service was quite good.

I didn't care for it. The beer was good, got an IPA they had on tap. Service was very good, my waitress was prompt and efficient.

We were seated right away at the counter surrounding the pizza oven and prep area and entertained ourselves watching the activity there. Even though our server also had to wait on a party of 30 we never had to wait long. Drinks and appetizer came quickly. We had the wings which are amazing and then split a Conrad pizza which was also very good. Definitely a keeper.

March 29, 2013|I was a little disappointing|2|"I was a little disappointing after hearing good reviews. The pizza had a horrible ""burnt"" ""carbon"" taste too it. Despite the burnt taste the crust was quite soggy. The venue also lacks a diversity of good appetizers. For a ""Gourmet Pizza"" restaurant wings just don't seem appropriate. We also noticed the place was quite loud, the ""club music"" playing made it difficult to talk over dinner."
March 24, 2013|We'll be back!|4|We ate at the restaurant prior to a show at the Providence Preforming Arts Center. PPAC is a block away and an easy walk. My party of three had the chicken wing appetizer, a half pepperoni and half mushroom pizza, and a salad. The portions were generous, tasty, and we were very full by the end of our meal. The service was good despite the restaurant being very busy and food arrived at our table very hot. This restaurant is not a place to go to if you want to have a quiet meal. The very high ceilings seem to amplify the background music. One cautionary note, if you get the chicken wing appetizer, don't eat the delicious onions that cover them unless you're prepared to be ostracized for two days. My wife ate the onions and she reeked.

March 9, 2013|Great slices|4|Place was packed on a Saturday. We were able to get reservations a few hours beforehand and got seated right away. Goat cheese appetizer was hot and delicious. The highlights here are obviously the pizzas. Extremely thin crust, great sauce and toppings. One pizza easily big enough for 2. Would highly recommend this place if you want fresh home made pizza in RI that's in the spirit of New Haven style pies
March 9, 2013|Best Pizza in Providence|4|Excellent Pizza... Best that I have come across in the Providence area. Now it's not Frank Pepe's but close.

March 5, 2013|Providence Coal Fired Pizza is Hot|5|Just a cool place with a great vibe, wonderful bar, and even better food. Not your typical pizza joint. Staff is friendly and personable. David, the chef, is more than happy to tell you about the unique cooking technique. Open kitchen so you can watch them in action. Everything is cooked in a coal fired oven that gives the food a great taste without the overwhelming smoke of a wood fired oven. I usually get the wings, oven baked not fried, and ribs, tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone, served on a bed on cold red cabbage salad to start. Pizza? Not what you think. All fresh ingredients. Great variety of cheeses. Choose any one of their distinct offerings or make you own combo, they are all delicious. My favorite, the “Baby Bella”,
March 2, 2013|Coal Fired Pizza was fantastic!|5|Coal Fired Pizza was fantastic! Our party had the wings, the Bianca pizza, and the Conrad pizza. All of them were fabulous. Highly recommended.

Enjoy having dinner here before a PPAC show and then having a drink after at the bar after the show. I reccomend making a reservation on weekends as the wait can be as long as two hours.

January 26, 2013|If you're in the mood for|4|"If you're in the mood for a somewhat fancier sit-down take on pizza in downtown Providence, Providence Coal Fired Pizza should definitely be under consideration. The pizzas are delicious, with a crispy thin crust full of flavor from the oven that delivery places just cannot duplicate. Also, the beer list is impressively long, and the cocktails are tasty. The appetizers leave something to be desired--we were hungry, but none of the options (which mostly appeared to be salads, even though there was a separate ""salad"" category) jumped out at us. The dessert options are similarly limited, but the chocolate mousse was pretty good. The pizza is the real star, though, and deservedly so."
January 18, 2013|Pizza was fresh and outstanding.|4|Pizza was fresh and outstanding. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. I'll be coming back.
January 11, 2013|We've been to Providence Coal|4|We've been to Providence Coal Fired Pizza many times. The food is always great, especially the chicken wings. It's a great atmosphere to hang out with friends amid an energetic crowd and several flat-screen TVs tuned into sports. The interior decor and food presentation is elegant with a rustic feel. Everything is perfect except their staff. While the staff gets the job done, they seem inexperienced. Their interactions with customers are overly casual and their professional etiquette is a bit lacking given the quality of the food, drinks, prices, and atmosphere. Overall, Coal Fired is one of our favorite restaurants in town!
January 9, 2013|We wanted relatively quick|5|We wanted relatively quick service because we were headed to the Dunk for a basketball game. Our waitress made that happen; everything moved smoothly. The pizzas -- we had three varieites -- were over-the-top in flavor and taste; the wings received ooh's and ahh's from all six at the table. The level of noise remains my only complaint. The restaurant was full on basketball night and it was impossible to participate in a conversation with others at the table. I experienced the same problem a couple of months ago when I attended with another group of six for semi-business reasons. The restaurant was about one-fourth full that night; yet I could not hear or participate in any of the discussion and I was supposed to be taking notes.

December 28, 2012|Good pizza but needs improvement|3|We read a lot of super reviews for PCFP and went with a lot of optimism. Made a great first impression on walking in, too. But our energy was immediately taken down by the curt, unsmiling and totally disinterested bartender. Never asked if we needed another drink, how our food was, or showed any concern for us. And there were just a few people at the bar so not like she was too busy. She never smiled ONCE and shoud not be a bartender, period. As for the food, chicken wings were good but not great. The baked goat cheeese was ok but a very small portion. The pizza? Again, good quality ingredients but overall not.great. Our margarita and duck pizzas were kinda dry and salty. Both needed more cheese or sauce or oil or something.

December 7, 2012|Visit #2|4|This is my second visit to PCFP. This time I ordered the tomato soup, rib app and a clam pizza. The soup was great! creamy, well spiced w/ little blocks of cheese. The rib meat fell off the bone and the spice mixture was flavorful!!. The clam pizza has great ingredients but the clams were too large and should have been chopped up finer. Overall, a great place to go before a PPAC performance!

I liked how they dressed the arugala with a hint of lemon.I hate when I get arugala on a pizza without anything on it. This one had a nice flavor. The chicken wings were excellent but would have liked it a little less salty. We will definately go back.

November 21, 2012|Not your typical Pizza place...|4|"I took my daughter before going to see a show at PPAC just a block away. She's 9 and wasn't thrilled with the idea of having pizza for our special mother-daughter ""date."" The staff and ambience made her feel special. It's not a typical pizza place and, especially to her, it felt fancy. It was bustling with people, but not too noisy for a conversation. At the end she said she never wants to go anywhere else in Providence! We had a great meal and a great time! Thanks!"

November 10, 2012|This was our second time coming|4|This was our second time coming here. The chicken wings are out of this world and the Margarita Pizza was fabulous. We had gone to PPAC and made reservations for after the show. Good thing we made reservations because it was a 2 hour wait for a table. Eight of us went and we enjoyed it. So much that we took an order of chicken wings and a whole pizza home with us. Great place and I would recommend it to anyone.
November 10, 2012|The Coal fired oven is a nice|4|The Coal fired oven is a nice feature but the price point puts them in a weird area. A couple of glasses of wine, an app, and a couple of pizzas cost us $70+ with tip.... It is very convenient for a meal after a show at the PPAC which is why we were there. Overall it's a nice night out, just more expensive than a pizza joint and not as nice as a sit-down traditional dinner in Providence.
November 9, 2012|Clam pizza was excellent,|4|Clam pizza was excellent, as was the house soup. Great atmosphere and plenty of room for a group to stretch out near the bar.
November 3, 2012|Liked the food a lot, service|4|Liked the food a lot, service was good, everything was perfect. Only drawback is for the money they charge per pizza, the portion is a little small. Don't think you are going with 2 people ordering 1 pizza and will be all set, you won't.

Tom recommended the chicken wings, which were absolutely delicious. My husband wanted to come back Sunday night as well as the other couple that we dined with just to eat those chicken wings. We had 3 pizza, Margarita, The Clam pizza and another meat pizza, THe Clam pizza was awesome. Cant wait to come again just to get that pizza, I have already recommended this restaurant to the people that i worked with.. Very good..

October 13, 2012|Food was excellent. The wings|5|Food was excellent. The wings were the BEST I have ever had anywhere. The waitress was very nice and accommodating. I asked for a variation on the white pizza and it was fantastic. The salad my sister ordered looked and tasted so good, that I ordered one. Hers was filled with beautiful tomatoes and cucumbers. I had 3 tomatoes and NO cucumbers. I told the waitress and she brought me a small dish of cucumbers. We had laughed that they only had butterscotch pudding and chocolate mousse for desserts. So we decided to try what surely must be the best butterscotch pudding ever. Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be fantastic!! The Hummus & Lentil salad was a hit. The vegetarian in our group was happy with her options.
October 13, 2012|Coal Fired Perfectiom|5|I visited Providence Coal Fired Pizza for the first time and was blown away by the experience. A friend and I were promptly seated within close proximity of the coal oven where we could see the pizzas being prepared by the chefs in a clean kitchen. The restaurant happened to be not busy at the time, so our order of baked chicken wings and the special pizza was prepared quickly and our waiter was very prompt. The food was fantastic. The wings were prepared with a sea salt and rosemary crust and covered with caramelized onions. The flavor was great an our smaller portion left just enough room to share a pizza. Our pizza was delicious with a pancetta, onion, olive oil and Gorgonzola cheese. I really liked the texture of the crust. Awesome!
October 12, 2012|Worth A Visit|4|Staff was friendly and accommodating. Food was very tasty. Must tries are the wings and if they have it the short rib pizza. Great place for a casual meal. Nice selection of wine and beer. Slight negative was that it can get noisy from all the people talking. Highly recommended.

The pizza is amung the best (I think the best) in the area. The oven roasted chicken wings are a must have, simple yet tasty. Things get crowded and a little noisy sometimes (if the bar is rocking, the restaurant is noisy), however we have never found it to be too noisy

They were all outstanding. The setting is nice, and given the location, valet is nice too. My only complaint would be the service, which was a bit slow and the order was messed up twice. I'm willing to cut some slack because the food was so good and we went at what seemed to be their busiest time. I'll definitely recommend and look to return in the near future.

They'll even do half and half if your group can't decide. Waitstaff might need a bit more training, one of them dropped one of our pizzas. Management graciously took the dropped off our bill. We'll return and recommend!
August 31, 2012|If you've never eaten coal|5|If you've never eaten coal fired pizza then this place is a must!! Delicious, fresh ingredients. We shared a small chicken wing appetizer -- I'm not a wings fan, but these were crispy and not greasy, topped with coal fired onions. Yum. Then we shared the fantastic Caesar salad. My husband and I shared The Conrad pizza. We were stuffed and couldn't muster room for the dessert pizza. It's unfortunate that we were simply passing through Providence because we would go back often. Complimentary valet parking -- how can you beat that? Love, love, love this place.
August 31, 2012|Food was so good that we came|5|Food was so good that we came back after seeing Jersey Boys and had the desert pizza. Thomas, our waiter, was excellent.. Definitely recommend Coal Fired Pizza.
August 30, 2012|This was our first time to|5|This was our first time to Prov Coal Fired Pizza and we were impressed! The appetizer special of pasta filled with cheese and smothered in a caramelized onion sauce was spectacular. The beer selection is very good and they had some great IPA's. The pizza was excellent although they could have brought the fixings to the edges more. Other than that, I highly recommend this place and look forward to our next visit which will be soon.
August 24, 2012|The only down side for us|4|The only down side for us was that we had made reservations a week in advance and they seated us by the door. There were plenty of other tables available.
August 24, 2012|Just what downtown needs!|4|There wasn't an open table review available when I made the reservation, but I had heard good things in ProJo and wanted to try it with my family. Very limited menu for an upscale place, but then you realize it's a pizza place at heart and that it just does it with some extra decor finesse. Food was great. Hummus appetizer was very good, pita with olive oil drizzled over it was a nice touch and the pizza was some of the best in Providence (and we've been to everyplace from Fellini to Caserta to Adesso and so on and so on). Service was super attentive, drinks were just ok, and essentially it was 2 different puddings for dessert. But it was upscale, affordable, and awesome pizza. Hope it makes it!
