ays ago|Excellent experiance|5|Top notch service, great food, sophisticated decor. Just under $400 for 4 people, a bottle of wine, and some before-dinner drinks. We went the 3-course meal route. I will save this for anniversaries and such.
February 27, 2016|So So good!|5|We celebrated our 44th anniversary at Gracie's last weekend and it was definitely the right choice! From the moment we walked in until we walked out the door, every person connected with Gracie's was warm and welcoming and we felt very much at home. The menu was amazing and the service was excellent. We sat sipping our (inspired!)cocktails and watched what seemed like a ballet of servers and waitstaff who were quickly and efficiently delivered dishes around the room. Our own server knew the menu and wine list well and seemed to really be excited to talk about the food and wine choices and help us choose. She never missed a beat through the evening and kept track through each step of our 3-course prefix menu with wine pairings. Every offering from the baby greens salad (perfectly dressed) and house-made gnocci with butternut squash and Brussels sprouts, to crispy skinned and pink local duck breast and swordfish (also just right), to beautifully presented desserts with delicious accents like lime pound cake with cashew brittle and coconut green curry sorbet and apple cloumage tart with ginger ganache and bay leaf ice cream were each delicious and beautifully presented. Our server brought each bottle offered as a wine pairing to our table and explained a little about it. Every pairing was spot on! What a fabulous evening we had! Our only suggestion would be from my husband who enjoys trying local craft beers (really dark ones!)when we travel. There is a limited beer menu, and we hope next time there will be as wonderful a selection of local brews as there are now seasonal cocktails. Thank you Gracie's!!!
February 25, 2016|Love is in the details|5|Beyond amazing - they pay attention to details and take pride in their service and food, everything was delicious and the atmosphere is relaxing - a perfect night- thank you
February 20, 2016|My dining partner and I are long-time fa...|5|My dining partner and I are long-time fans of Ellie's, the associated bakery of Gracie's, so we decided to check out the full restaurant experience. We were certainly not disappointed. We decided to go for the nine-course tasting menu with the wine pairings and had a wonderful time with it. The food was interesting and exceptional, and the wine pairings were perfect. We both learned a lot throughout our meal. The service was welcoming and very hospitable, we felt like we were all friends by the end of the night. The environment is also fun with the artwork, star theme, and lighting. It was a special evening that we will not forget. Thank you, Gracie's!
February 20, 2016|Tasting Menu|5|Knowledgable staff. Impressed that the tasting menu was spaced out and not rushed through.
February 20, 2016|Another wonderful meal!|5|Another wonderful meal!

February 19, 2016|Another great go-to place. Always great ...|5|Another great go-to place. Always great service and food. Don't let the price scare you. You can go there without spending too much money. This is becoming more and more a really special place for us.
February 19, 2016|Food? Top Shelf...Wine Pairings?...Worst ever|2|Went to Gracie's with my wife for a romantic dinner. While the food, service and ambiance lived up to my expectations, the whole evening was spoiled by the wine pairings portion of the tasting menu. With a 5 course tasting menu that included smoked salmon, venison, cheese raviolis, etc., it is inconceivable that they served 2 Sherrys (one which the waitress advised was better for cooking), 2 Rieslings and 1 cheap Merlot. (Think $15 Long Island, NY) While no one should have to suffer with such atrocious pairings, being first-timers, Gracie's had the opportunity to win us over and have us return often as my wife and I both enjoy great food and wine. If you try Gracie's, I recommend the tasting menu (5, 7, or 9 courses) but do yourself a favor and order by the glass or bottle.
February 18, 2016|"Great place the is unique as well
Servic..."|5|Great place the is unique as well Service was the best with special treats too.
February 16, 2016|"Had my ""Valentine's"" dinner here"|5|I work in the industry so I don't celebrate Valentine's Day with my girlfriend on the normal day. We had ours on a Tuesday. I knew I should do the tasting, but I also heard that it may not be as big of portions that you think. Well that was false. I did the 5 course tasting as well as the wine and non alcoholic pairings. Each course and pairing was in point. The wine played well with the food and made each dish stand out fantastically. This was one of the best tasting menus I have had in a while!
February 16, 2016|Another great evening.  The food and ser...|5|Another great evening. The food and service were great as usual. The menu was outstanding. Every piece of the experience was exceptional. The drinks created by the mixologist (Kristi) were outdone only by the chef's preparations in the kitchen. We wish we lived over Gracies and could call it our dining room!
February 14, 2016|Romantic Spot|5|Went here on Valentine's Day and the staff, meals, wine, and desserts were all perfect. Couldn't recommend a date place more highly.
February 14, 2016|We were there for Valentine's and had a great time|5|Great food, good drinks, but the bar eating area was cold compared to the main dining area.
February 14, 2016|We frequent Gracie's often. We had made ...|3|We frequent Gracie's often. We had made reservations there for Valentine's Day due to the past excellent experiences we had. Our friends who were recently engaged asked to join and about a week out I called to change the reservation. The girl on the phone was very rude. Telling me she wasn't sure if she would be able to accommodate that change. She was able to after being on hold for several minutes, then has the audacity to tell me we had to be out of there by 8:45. Our reservation was for 6:30, if it takes more than 2 hours to eat dinner, there's a problem. Unfortunately, this lack of customer service has made us change our opinion on Gracie's.
February 14, 2016|Phenomenal Meal!|5|I have been to Gracie's twice. The first time was about 12 years ago. I had a bad meal and poor service and never returned until Valentine's Day after friends and family insisted that I try it again. They told me that me first experience was an aberration. They were right. My girlfriend had the gnocchi appetizer and swordfish entree. I had the cream of celery soup and the rib eye steak. All of our courses were cooked to perfection and the service was equally wonderful. We will return. My only suggestion is that they add some side dishes to the menu. We would have like some veggies and a starch with our entrees.
February 13, 2016|Waited over an hour to get a table when ...|3|Waited over an hour to get a table when we had a reservation. Server was more interested in serving the table next to us which was middle aged bougie couple who were seated after us.
February 13, 2016|Gracie's never disappoints!|5|We had the 7 course chef's tasting menu with wine pairing! Each course was incredible and the wine pairings were perfect! I could have eaten each course as a main dish alone! I never wanted dinner to end! The staff was very attentive, even for such a busy night!
February 13, 2016|Good food experience.|4|Pros: The food was good and it was an interesting dining-experience. Cons: Valet driver was rude, the building was cold so I kept my winter coat on, the food was very salty, and although we had reservations we weren't seated for another 20minutes after our time.
February 13, 2016|One of, if not the best, PVD fine dining spots|5|There's a lot to love about Gracie's: the ambiance, the food, the wonderful little amuse bouches that come between courses. But this review is devoted to their service, which is wonderful. From the moment your car pulls up to the valet station, Gracie's has some of the best, most professional, and welcoming service staff in the City. The food was great as well, all of it perfectly timed and cooked as requested. I cannot wait to return! Wonderful place to bring a date.
February 12, 2016|Always such an experience|5|HUbby and I had a joint birthday/valentine's dinner and treated ourselves to the 7 course with wine. What a wonderful experience being served delectable surprise after surprise. We had wine from Spain, Italy, France, and Greece, a small glass of cava to celebrate the night, and an overall amazing food and service experience.
February 10, 2016|Don't ever take a group to this restaurant|1|"Had a reservation months ahead with this establishment for 8 people. When we arrived (on time) our reservation was ready and we were seated immediately. The restaurant was about 1/2 full. That is about all I can say good about this place. The wait staff was informative and helpful, but failed to keep us informed about our dinners. The waiter did warn us that if we ordered the ""4 course Chef menu"" it would take 3-3 1/2 hours to get served. We decided to order a la carte. The wait was excruciating. It took us over 3 1/2 hours to complete the meal. (we ordered within 15 minutes of arrival) The food, when it finally arrived was ok, nothing worth waiting 1 1/2 hours between the salad and main course. There were some items I can not explain from their menu - 3 orders of Swordfish - all plates exactly the same - 2 priced twice as much as the other. While this may be a decent place to bring a date for a LONG evening - I could not recommend it for a group. It is overpriced, the menu makes little to no sense, is not well explained."
February 10, 2016|Amazing Service|3|Service was some of the best in Providence, food on the other hand was just ok. It may have just been what we had but neither of us were impressed. Regardless will not be heading back. Too many other amazing and unexplored restaurants here in Providnece to try out!
February 5, 2016|Absolutely will be back!|5|Champagne upon arrival for my husband's birthday, beautiful table-scape, and helpful staff.. Just in the first few minutes! The food was amazing and the pace of the meal was perfect. I already requested we have MY birthday dinner here;)
January 30, 2016|Decent food but not worth the price|3|Arrived with a reservation, on time and was told to wait. So we stood in a cold room by the door for 5-10 minutes while they furnished our table, no one welcomed us or made us feel invited. Pretty poor way to start of a special night. Had the 7 course tasting with pairing. Some of the dishes lacked inspiration. Boulliebaise with no special teniques or ingredients. Just some mussels, calamari, and a 31/35 shrimp. I'm not spending 400 dollars on dinner for 2 to eat a dish I can pay 25 bucks for at any bistro. The menu lacked inspiration, and presented many traditional French dishes with no imagination. The dessert was laughable. A rock hard semifredo served on a 1 cm chocolate disc. How was I suppose to eat this without being clumsy and loud. While there were highlights, the octopus salad to start was great, and the wine pairings were perfect, I still left feeling that I got a bit ripped off.

January 30, 2016|Off The Mark|4|Been to Gracie's a few times over the last few years. Always excellent. Seeing we were going to PPAC later in the evening, it would be the perfect place for dinner. As ALWAYS the food was top shelf, and the service started out pretty good at first. Then things took a dastardly turn like Cabaret did three quarters through the show. Ordered drinks, then was going to order some wine with dinner, but the waitress never offered and disappeared quickly. Ordered dessert and coffee............. We were finished with dessert, and I, my espresso, but my wife's coffee never arrived. The Manager, I think, arrived and was very accommodating. He adjusted our bill, probably for more than he should have. That lessened the suffering. Hate to slam such a good place. Feeling a little guilty about it, so we're going to half to go again to make sure the evening was a fluke.
January 29, 2016|Anniversary dinner|5|Absolutely wonderful experience!! We loved it! From the appetizer to the dessert and everything in between, it was delicious and an experience to remember!
January 26, 2016|Perfect for pre-theater!|5|I love the fact that Gracie's has a new policy which allows you to eat your first two courses leisurely before theater and then enjoy your dessert after the show. I can't imagine a better evening and it means that I was able to get get the 3 course menu and not rush!! Gracie's has outdone itself again!
January 22, 2016|Waitstaff were very accommodating- even ...|4|Waitstaff were very accommodating- even suggested we return after the theater to enjoy our dessert- great idea!
January 21, 2016|Superior rstaurant|5|Each of our 3 courses were five star...beet salad, swordfish and creme brûlée, exquisitley presented, everything cooked perfectly and presented in a true artistic culinary fashion. The atmosphere is gorgeous , nice lighting and the service at the bar top notch! Will be returning soon!
January 20, 2016|Gracie's was amazing. The only thing I c...|5|Gracie's was amazing. The only thing I could possibly say bad about it was we had to wait longer than intended even with a reservation. It was restaurant weeks so it was understandably busy. The bartender was very polite along with the other servers. The swordfish was perfect. The creme brulee was delicious but just on the thin side for me. The service was unbelievable.
January 20, 2016|We Love Gracie's!!!|5|"Gracie's is a ""must do"" If you enjoy amazing food! We consider ourselves ""foodies"" and when we find an amazing restaurant, we are loyal. Gracie's has a wonderful atmosphere, professional, friendly, informative staff, and food that absolutely delicious! Is is expensive? Not for the quality of what you receive. Gracie's is not to be missed if your like quality Providence dining."
January 19, 2016|wonderful treat|5|We loved every morsel and every bite. It was a pleasure eating here, I hope to visit again.
January 19, 2016|Gracie's was an amazing experience, once...|5|"Gracie's was an amazing experience, once again. Food was so delicious, palate cleansers were so much fun, and the presentation - both on the plate and to the table - was creative & added to the ""beautiful"" of the evening. If you visit RI, go to Gracie's. If you live in RI, definitely go to Gracie's!"
January 19, 2016|Great First Time Experience|5|My wife and I went out to dinner with another couple at Gracie's. For all of us it was our first experience there. The service was outstanding and the food was very good. We went because we had heard great reviews from our friends and we were not disappointed.
January 16, 2016|Amazing Dinner w/ Amazing Friends|5|The food and service were both phenomenal. The waiter we had gave the best suggestions for wine to pair with our meal and was very attentive. We dined as a group of 6 and loved the dining booth we were seated at with the plush pillows for comfort. The duck was amazing and one our friends is a pescatarian, which the chef was very accommodating to her requests. Best part were the small samples given between each course. The raspberry sorbet was so delicious I wish there was more than just a spoon full. This was our second time at Gracie's and it won't be our last.
January 16, 2016|Absolutely stunning in all aspects!|5|We knew going to Gracie's that they had won several awards for their food and wine list, but they exceeded all expectations! The service, the food, the bar, the wine, everything was absolutely flawless in every way! The quality of meal we got for the price was outstanding. Loved the extra touches like the spoon of sorbet in between courses and the complimentary macarons after dinner - even the valet left us 2 chocolate chip cookies in the car! Gracie's truly exceeded expectations and I can see why it's one of the top restaurants in RI!
January 16, 2016|Fabulous, as always|5|"My husband and I took his sister and her fiance to dinner at Gracie's. It was a combined ""congratulations on your engagement"" and ""farewell, we're going to miss you now that you're moving to the other side of the country"" dinner. We were delighted to treat them to dinner at the best restaurant in Providence. It was, as always, a fabulous meal. The service was impeccable, as was the food. The staff is consistently thoughtful, polite, and engaging. As someone with a dietary restriction, I always appreciate how careful they are with my meals. I can't say enough good things about Gracie's!"
Dined on January 16, 2016|Dolce Dining|4|We always consider Gracie's a special event. There is such charm and elegance mixed with an ease of service. We enjoyed our experience right from the greeting to the dessert. Everyone always makes a special effort to be engaging and making sure every need is met. Whenever we want to celebrate in style and be a bit extravagant, we choose this lovely venue to feel special, welcome and appreciated! Your menu is ever enticing and there is never an end to the niceties in treats and main course. Thank you for being an unique and enchanting cubby in the middle of bustling Providence. We will be back !
January 16, 2016|The Must-Go place in Providence! I went ...|5|The Must-Go place in Providence! I went to Gracie's during restaurant week. My friend and I had mostly every dishes in the restaurant week, and all of them were fantastic! This could be quite pricy in a regular days (not restaurant week), but I believe it's worth spending money. Serving was excellent and had great wine suggestions. Definitely will visit again!
January 15, 2016|Gracie's 1st time|3|The food was not anything special. Even though the service was nice, they did not seem to want to be there and you felt that. Made it feel like they didn't want to serve on me. The host stand even seemed like I was bothering them as they sat us.
January 15, 2016|First time at Gracie's|5|It was my first time going and it was suggested to me by some friends. I went with my best friend, and the two of us had a great night. The food was amazing, the staff was great. Jessica was our server, she was polite and very helpful. I would take a girl here on a first date in a heartbeat
January 14, 2016|Good food, great presentation, excellent service.|5|Ambiance is superb at Gracie's. Service is attentive and friendly. The food, for the most part, is creative and tasty.

January 13, 2016|My fave Providence dinner spot has a new rival!|5|"For years now I've been going to Bocaro's on date nights. It had long been my ""far and away"" #1 place to go for fine dining. I had always heard great things about Gracie's, but, like most humans, when you find something you deem to be perfect, I found it difficult to try any other spot. But last Wednesday, I did the hard thing to do, and decided to give another place a chance... so I made reservations at Gracie's. And what a great decision it turned out to be! I'm going to get my one criticism out of the way... We were seated about 30min after our reservation time. Normally that would be quite annoying. But there were a few open seats at the bar, so we had seat while we waited and enjoyed a very well made Martini. When our take was ready, there were many apologies for the wait, which was nice that it was an acknowledged lapse in service. Then it was all smooth sailing from there. Cheese plate appetizer - sounds boring, but no! Amazing! It's a must try. Duck breast - I'm a big fan of duck... And this preparation blew my expectations out of the water! Pasta dish - the name of which I can't remember but our server recommended it and described it as ""the most amazing bolognese you'll ever have""... He was spot on. Carrot cake dessert - a refreshingly small portion after all we had just eaten... But wow... The flavor was tremendous! Lastly... The thing that blew us both away were the ""extras"". Like the complimentary lemon sorbet to cleanse your pallet in between the appetizer and meals. The tiny treats given with the check. Even the mini cookies left by the valet attendant in your car as it's driven to curbside for you! Long story short... Reservations were just made again for this week! Gracie's is amazing!!"
January 13, 2016|my favorite Providence restaurant|5|Delicious meal, wonderful service, an opportunity to taste the wines i was considering for my meal. Do not miss
January 13, 2016|Heavenly Gnocchi|5|Gracies is my go to restaurant for self-indulgence. From the valet to hostess to server - you are made to feel special. While pricey for regular visits, taking advantage of Restaurant Week allows me to go at least three times a year. Then the main reason to go, the food! For me, flawless every time. Taste and presentation rule. My wish is the last thing I taste in this life is their gnocchi. Light and somehow served with sophistication. Kudos all around to this fine restaurant in a city filled with many opportunities for great food. Gracie's definitely in my top three!
January 13, 2016|Absolutely great|5|We have visited the restaurant several times. Always a good experience. Our visit during restaurant week in Providence was especially enjoyable because of the fixed price menu and reasonable price.
January 12, 2016|Our favorite!|5|Such a special experience! Great service and an amazing meal. Can't beat it. I was actually crushed that I was too full to finish my final restaurant week course. Everything was delicious and it's such a lovely spot.
January 12, 2016|Favorite Restaurant in Providence|5|We have been to Gracie's many times, and feel that it has the best food, service and ambience in Providence. We recommend it highly. They are always very wecoming, attentive to food allergies. We hagve friends who are gluten free and vegan, and they tell us that they never have a problem at Gracie's. The bread is fantastic, the amuse bouche a nice treat, the intermeezzo and uncommon addition nowadays, and the sweet treat at the end a lovely way to end a great experience. All of this is on top of whatever incredible courses that you order! One final note, we notice that their staff does not turn over a lot, which frequently indicates that they treat their employees well, too. Bravo!
January 2, 2016|We have been dining at Gracies for years...|5|We have been dining at Gracies for years, and every experience has been great, but this was the most amazing of all. Ironically, it was the night before they closed for their off-week in January. We had the seven course tasting menu, and it was outstanding. We identified our new favorites from this experience (think tuna!).
January 1, 2016|Best of the best|5|This was our first visit to Gracie's and it certainly will not be our last! We decided to go with the 9 course flight and it was amazing. The chef is a true master! The layers of flavor that came through in every bite left you wanting more. The waitstaff worked in synchronous harmony. Everything was attended to and you lacked for nothing. Gracie's gets an A++ in my book.
December 31, 2015|Long wait, no apology.|3|We had a dinner reservation on New Year's Eve for 9PM. We waited with no place to sit for over 40 minutes (I was seriously regretting my decision to wear heels) and when we were finally seated, we received no acknowledgement or apology for the absurd wait time. In fact, the hostess seemed downright annoyed when we asked how much longer the wait would be. Ultimately, the wait time made it impossible for us to make it to our plans for midnight. For that level of inconvenience, I would have expected a genuine apology at the very least. The food, as always, was great and our waiter was friendly. But I'll think twice before going back for a special occasion.
December 31, 2015|Great food- terrible wait|4|Gracies was some of the best food I have ever had, we did the 7 course tasting menu and it was amazing. The one issue was we had a reservation for 9 and were not seated till 9:30. We were standing by the hostess area, they kept lying to people saying it would just be a few mins. At 9:20 the 8:45 reservations were very upset, but they still told people coming in it would be a few mins. I know things happen but there was constant lying to customers and that bothered me.
December 31, 2015|Poor Service|2|"The hostess was condescending and rude, we were seated 35 minutes after our reservation time and the then the service was slow. For example; ""would you like more bread?""....15 minutes later the same person who had not yet come back, ""would you like more bread?"", We had heard great things about the food, but found it somewhat too salty. We had to ask 3 different people for our check at the end of our meal, finally after demanding they bring the check now we were able to leave. We would not return to this restaurant."
December 31, 2015|New Year's Eve With Friends|4|Gracie's is known for featuring game and seafood, and the New Year's Eve menu offerings were no exception. Our waiter provided expert and patient guidance (there were a number of different tasting menu and prix fixe options); each of the four of us chose a slightly-different 3-course prix fixe meal including dessert. The portions were generous; our friends (first-timers at Gracie's) were thrilled with the duck breast; I tried the appetizer with rabbit--interesting, but I can't say that I'm a convert. My husband and I added the wine pairings which were excellent. Our only complaint--a minor one--is that the secondary wait staff failed to bring one of us coffee immediately when requested, so that it could not be consumed with dessert as requested. Otherwise--a great New Year's Eve dinner!
December 19, 2015|So Disappointed|2|Planned an evening out to celebrate our daughter coming home from abroad after a year and we were truly disappointed! The service lacked, we kept having to remind them that we got the wine pairing when the wine kept now showing up with the course. The food was good. When we mentioned the poor service for the evening we were told oh that's too bad! We told them ahead of time it was a special evening. Someone finally mentioned it after the third course. We spend too much money for such service.
December 19, 2015|This place is amazing.|5|I have been to many fine dining restaurants in several major cities, Gracies is my favorite. Service is exceptional, the food is 100% fresh, and the presentation is near perfect. It's not cheap but it's reasonable considering the quality of the experience. I do and will continue to recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a special, romantic night out.
December 18, 2015|Always Delightful|5|Gracie's is a superior dining experience from the moment you walk through the door to the minute the valet brings you your car. The service is exceptional, the food is creative and delicious, the drinks are well poured and the wine and beer selection are thoughtful. It's just one of our favorites, and in all of our trips there, Gracie's has never failed to delight us.
December 17, 2015|the 9 course tasting menu|5|The fall tasting menu was great, everything was perfect, highlights included Foie paired with chilled Madeira ( incredible). Cavatelli with succulent braised beef . Fun to learn about the '08 Barbaresco from Virgina, our server had been to the Vineyard
December 10, 2015|Expected more|3|"Second time dining at Gracies. Was disappointed this time. Felt like assembly line After initial order the head waitress was scarce. Left all explanation of courses to ancillary help. Felt as if they were reciting a script but when asked questions were not knowledgeable. Had wine pairings but the pour was very skinny- maybe an ounce at best. Food presentation was unique and very classy. All but the main course was exquisite. I do not feel the ""experience "" was equivalent to the price. I've had better dining experience at the Spiced Pear, Birch and other local restaurants. I don't think I'll return which saddens me."
December 8, 2015|I Love Gracies!|5|My favorite restaurant never disappoints. The food is excellent and fresh, service impeccable. This is my go- to place for special occasions.
December 5, 2015|Another amazing evening at Gracie's.  We...|5|Another amazing evening at Gracie's. We invited another couple to join us and we enjoyed a tasting menu. It was so creative and tasty! The Winter cocktail additions were also much enjoyed. It was a winner of an experience.
December 5, 2015|My new favorite|5|I just love Providence. The restaurants here are unbelievable. Gracie's is on the top of my list. From the Fois Gras to the Brook Trout, OMG, the flavor explosion was unbelievable. All the flavors merry together nicely. Barely saved room for the chocolate bread pudding. A must go to. you will not be disappointed.
December 4, 2015|Food was top notch and different.|5|If you are a foodie that appreciates a flair for interesting dishes that is not the norm and prepared perfectly, this place is a must for you. The wait staff is pleasant, well educated, and work to ensure a great experience. We have found another favorite on our list.
December 1, 2015|Perfect celebration|5|Another perfect experience at Gracie's! We tend to return here for special occasions and we have never been disappointed. We had the seven course tasting menu with wine and it was amazing. Each course was carefully prepared and the portions were ideal for the number of courses served. Our server noted preferences and allergies and produced a tailored, surprise experience that was simply sublime. Our nine year old son came along and enjoyed a tremendous cheese plate, as well as amazing duck breast. Wine pairings were great - eclectic but right on target. Service was outstanding. A team of professional, courteous and engaging staff doted on us all night. Overall an experience not to be missed!
November 28, 2015|great Grub at Gracie's|4|Our choices for appetizers were Octopus and Gnocci were creative, and delicious. The entrees of duck breast, rabbit and halibut were attractively presented, cooked to our liking (succulent and with creative seasoning). The service level fell apart at dessert, unfortunately. They forgot one of the drinks, and did not serve our desserts together, leaving one of us to watch the others enjoy. This shouldn't happen at this level . Still, it was a great dinner despite the collapse at the end.
November 27, 2015|Unbelievable food. I'm still thinking ab...|5|Unbelievable food. I'm still thinking about it.
November 20, 2015|excellent|5|lovely all around experience--great food, interesting menu choices with nice complementary tastes before and between courses, excellent service, nice relaxed ambiance
November 18, 2015|Intimate, romantic and delicious|5|Gracie's arranged for us to have the best table for 2 in the restaurant - had called in advance to make the reservation and explained the occasion. This was my first time at Gracie's and I didn't expect the setting to be as intimate as it was with a little private area, lit candles and shiny little paper-stars sprinkled around the white table cloth. My girlfriend felt really special. The prix fixe menu was phenomenal; the waiter helped us make our wine selections, provided us with a celebration drink and assisted my girlfriend in making some modifications resulting in a vegetarian course to suit her preferences. The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and attentive to us. The host and the valet driver even helped in getting my gift from the car and bringing it along with dessert which again was a nice little surprise for her.
November 17, 2015|Best restaurant in providence|5|We have been to many restaurants in providence and no one comes close to Gracie's. They have maintained their quality over the years
November 17, 2015|Anniversary at Gracie's|5|Our experience at Gracie's was absolutely incredible. From the delicious, creative meal courses to the wine pairings, to the personalized service, Gracie's is a gem. It is also the most expensive restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of dining at, so Gracie's is what I would call 'a special occasion experience' and not something I would recommend for a routine night out. Loved every bite though!

November 14, 2015|Disappointed|2|We found our meal very disappointing. We probably won't be going back. Everything was under seasoned - my fish was over cooked and the entire dish was greasy and bland. The desserts were lovely, but tasteless. My husbands pasta was very gummy. Gummy pasta? That is a rookie mistake and, frankly, the dish should not have been served.
November 13, 2015|Great place!|5|Went to Gracie's for my wife's birthday with a few couples. The staff called and offered the wine room, was perfect. Food was amazing, service was great and wine pairing was spot on.
November 11, 2015|Great Birthday Celebration|5|We enjoyed a great birthday celebration. The table confetti, card, and champagne were an unexpected pleasant surprise. Each course was delicious and the service was top notch.

Dined on November 7, 2015|good food near PPAC|3|"Like most fancy restaurants, the place was poorly lit. But I brought my flashlight so I could read the menu. I lent my flashlight to the nice couple next to us, they were struggling to read their menu with the little table candle. The menu is a hardcover book that is as big as a coffee table book. This creates awkwardness at the table - guests move the menu book at different angles trying to catch some light. The starter was very good and savory. The rabbit/gnocchi was excellent. The main course was super-excellent. The trout was perfectly prepared, the essence of the fresh fish was saved while the outside was crisp and not greasy. As a fisherman and farmer, I would say that the chef was able to use fresh meat and fish and doll it up without ruining it. Prices were fair. The dessert menu was made-up by a stoner who has the munchies. Don't order the ""cheesecake"" which is not cheesecake at all but a weird purple gel inside a flavorless chocolate tube, with syrupy nuts, coffee ice cream and corn flakes on top. The only thing missing was marshmallows and M&M's. All of the desserts had too many ingredients that did not go with each other. The pastry chef needs to stop trying to be fancy and complicated and instead, come up with choices that are refreshing, classic and elegant. I would have liked vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberries. Gracie's uses about 6 waiters per table and we couldn't find any of them when we needed something. I ordered a drink and was told to give my order to the other waiter. I had to get up and chase someone down to get my drink. We were left alone for a long, long time after that. I had to get up again to place our main course order. Then I had to get up again to get our bill so that we could leave. If you're not chasing down the wait staff, you'll spend about 8 hours in Gracie's. I recommend the trout."
November 6, 2015|Awesome service|5|The food and service were excellent. Steak was cooked to perfection. Server was very patient with my date, who to say the least was picky.
November 5, 2015|Exceptional|5|One of the best meals I have ever had. The three course prefixe was an excellent deal for the dishes. Big serving sizes with several options. The servers were happy to share opinions and answer questions about the menu. Would definitely come back when I'm in the area.

October 31, 2015|Best restaurant in RI|5|Perhaps the best restaurant anywhere. But I haven't been everywhere. So, I'll be conservative and say that Gracie's is so much better than any other restaurant in RI that it seems like every other place is, in some way, kidding.

October 21, 2015|Birthday|5|Took my fiancé here for his birthday we had a 5 course blind tasting it was exceptional, we enjoyed ever course and have already decided we have to go back
October 17, 2015|Good not great|4|We were a party of five on a busy Saturday night. We had hoped to expand to eight, but we were told that this was impossible, but in fact our table would have easily accommodated three more seats (we were in a large banquette in the corner). That was disappointing. As for the food, Duck, rabbit, and steak were excellent. Scallops were unavailable by 8pm, and so we substituted halibut, which was OK. Appetizers were mixed. Carrots and turnips were uninspired, octopus was excellent. Both lemon tart and creme brule were good.
October 17, 2015|Good but nothing special|4|Gracie's is a nice restaurant but to be quite honest I was not very impressed with the menu. The staff was very friendly and professional and the venue is great, but there are definitely better finds in providence (especially in this price range!)
October 16, 2015|Fabulous!|5|Gracie's was amazing - food, service, presentation, atmosphere, staff. We started with foie gras, squash soap, sweetbreads. All so delicious. Main courses we chose: rigatoni, ribeye, sea scallops. All three dishes were perfectly prepared and seasoned. Nice pairing with scallops (grits, sprouts, butternut squash) and ribeye (wild mushrooms, shallots). Hubby loved the rigatoni (although I thought the pasta was a touch overcooked. With the sausage based sauce, the pasta needed to be al dente). We were also celebrating our son's 18th birthday and they did a lovely table with star sprinkles, a card with a quote from Gertrude Stein, and a glass of champagne for the old parents and sparkling cider for the two teens. Such a nice surprise and really made our event memorable! Thanks, Gracie's!
October 16, 2015|A very unique dining experience|5|Awesome food with wonderful wine pairings. Not the typically place my wife and I would go, but really enjoyed it. Looking forward to going back for the BLIND tasting opportunities!

Added bonus: So many small surprises throughout dinner for special occasion- a most thoughtful and classy restaurant. Our favorite restaurant for celebrations!
October 10, 2015|Nice place, great staff...|3|Went here with the wife on a hint that this place was fantastic. So I cancelled my reservation at Bouchard's to try this place out. We ordered some cocktails To go along with our Foie Gras and Veal Sweetbread. It was amazing! Then my Ribeye and my wife's Duck came out with paired wine. Was disappointed to no end. Steak was perfectly cooked but lack all sorts of flavor. Don't know how they accomplished this. The duck was overcooked to the point it was tough! Had Brûlée and cheese plate for dessert. They were fine but could not repair the damage the main courses did... $240 w/ tip later and we were trying to decide what takeout to bring home...
October 10, 2015|Another great experience.|5|Food is creative and service is impeccable. I only wish the tables weren't so close together, I hate hearing other people's conversations.
October 10, 2015|Fabulous, as always|5|It's always fun to bring a friend who hasn't been to Gracie's before, and watch as they realize what a fantastic place it is. As each phase of the evening occurs, their jaw drops lower and lower, as they enjoy every bite and special note of culinary finesse and service. Thanks for another wonderful evening!
October 9, 2015|Impressed and delighted!|5|First time diners here- we were blown away by the attention to detail by the servers and chef as well as the accommodating nature of the bartender. As a diner that is in search of seasonal local fare, I was impressed and delighted by the early Fall selections. Really a beautiful night out for a couple but I would return with a larger party. Very interested in the tastings menu and can't wait to come back.
October 8, 2015|Great experience|5|Went to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Great dining experience. Chef selections offered many different options that you wouldn't see on most menus. They also offer a chef's selection tasting menu which provides you the opportunity to experience several of the entree specials. Each course is exceptionally prepared and presented by the very attentive staff. I would highly recommend, however, be prepared, as it is quite pricey.
October 2, 2015|Wonderful experience|5|I always think of Gracie's when celebrating a special occasion. The service is stellar and the food is delicious, and Gracie's always adds in special touches to make the experience even more enjoyable. My friends and I dined in the wine cellar and had plenty of privacy. Thanks again for a memorable visit. We will return.
October 2, 2015|Three reasons to go to Gracie's|3|1. Fabulous breads (try them all). 2. Attentive, knowledgable service. 3. The grilled octopus appetizer - tenderest version of this dish I've ever eaten. Prices are steep and the bill adds up quickly but portions are generous. The food is beautifully presented though sometime does not live up to its appearance. Be prepared to cool your heels at the bar if you're lucky enough to get a seat while waiting for your table (it was a busy Saturday night so somewhat expected). Overall a positive experience but not quite five-star-worthy.
October 2, 2015|This was our first experience at Gracie'...|5|This was our first experience at Gracie's. It was truly outstanding in every way! The staff including Stephanie, Kelly, Gabby, and Kaitlin were caring, knowledgeable and attentive! They did everything they could to make this birthday celebration special in every way! We highly recommend it to all!

September 26, 2015|Amazing|5|Other than a 1/2 delay even though we had a reservation the evening at Gracie'a was nothing short of extraordinary
September 26, 2015|Original Paulie D|5|Great food served very creatively. Service by Lydia was outstanding and made it a great experience!
September 22, 2015|A real treat|5|We arrived on the train from NYC, 30 mins late for our reservation and with luggage. We were treated with care, the staff was very accommodating and kind. The food matched the impeccable service including complimentary special treats from the kitchen.the food was delicious, we did the 3 course meal. Id go back in a heartbeat.
September 22, 2015|Never disappointed|5|Gracie's always delivers. My last visit was the third visit to Gracie's. My first experience was a business dinner and my colleagues were from out of town and enjoyed every aspect of Gracie's, my second visit was a birthday dinner for a friend who enjoyed her experience and my third visit was with my husband for a night out. Whenever you visit Gracie's you always feel special. The waitstaff is prepared and ready to answer any questions about the menu, wine etc., I always feel taken care of when I eat here. I don't have to worry about anything other than enjoying myself. Gracie's is truly a special place and a Providence Gem!
September 18, 2015|Wonderful evening!|5|The food was amazing with very attentive staff. Was intrigued by the non-alcoholic cocktail pairing, so decided to give it a try. Each cocktail was so complimentary to each of the delicious dishes. Very impressive! Will definitely go back and recommend to others.
September 18, 2015|To Dine For...|5|Fantastic Restaurant- my wife and I went there for our 10th anniversry and from the moment we walked into the door they treated us like royalty. The service, the food, the company :) All Top Shelf!
September 18, 2015|Perfect Anniversary|5|Everything about our 5th Anniversary Dinner at Gracie's was perfect: the ambiance, the food, the wine pairings, the service, the attention to detail. They even sent a postcard after our meal to thank us for coming! I would recommend Gracie's to anyone for a special occasion.
September 18, 2015|AWESOME!!|5|Great food. Great service. Perfect cosmos. Girls' night at PPAC with dinner at Gracie ' s first. Our first Gracie ' s experience and we loved it.
September 17, 2015|Outstanding Gourmet Food|5|We went here because it was across the street from Trinity Repertory Theatre where we were to attend a performance of Julius Caesar. I looked up the website and was not as enthusiastic as I now know I should have been. Simple salads were perfectly executed and my Rigatoni and my wife'sfish were perfect. Great wine list. Delicious desert. I almost ignored a gem of a restaurant by viewing web site. I get credit for reading the reviews however- uniformly glowing !
September 16, 2015|What happened to Gracies?|3|Arrived for dinner before the theater. 3 couples in the dining room so plenty of time to get things right. The first course with wine pairing arrived before our cocktails were served so things were out of whack from the get go. Instead of removing the first course so we could enjoy our cocktails, they poured the wine. Just what I wanted - a martini with my salad with a wine chaser. Main course was a mixed bag with my wife enjoying hers while my pasta dish brought back memories of the chow hall at college. Wow, what a difference from when Gracies was something special. Willing to give it another try but it will have to be very special to restore itself to a top tier restaurant.
September 12, 2015|9/12/15|3|Waited almost 1 hour even with a reservation. Once seated we waited another 15 minutes to get any attention. Great atmosphere and the entrees were excellent. We ordered a gazpacho for a starter. It was tasty but the serving size was a joke.
September 12, 2015|Stunning Food...|4|I visited with five family members who were visiting from the UK. The food was way beyond expectations - I can't recommend it enough. The only slight let down was the speed of service, we sat with main course plates on the table for more than 20 minutes before they were cleared. If we hadn't been heading somewhere afterwards this wouldn't have been a problem. It won't stop me telling everyone I know to visit Gracie's.
September 12, 2015|Overpriced|3|Overpriced and not terribly good food. Very nice waitstaff, however.
September 12, 2015|Wonderful food; service needs improvement|4|All food was creative and perfectly prepared. For this quality and cost of food, the service needs to be better. Our main server was very inattentive. We ordered wine with dinner, but it didn't arrive when dinner was served. We had to ask for it twice after that and actually stop eating so that we didn't finish our entrees before the wine arrived. This really detracted from the overall experience of the wonderful food.
September 12, 2015|what a find|5|we found Gracie's by chance and are so glad we did. We celebrated my birthday with a special meal. We both ordered the 3 course pris fixe menu and it was phenomenal! The wine pairings were spot on and even the palate cleanser was delicious. Wonderful service, too
September 5, 2015|Wonderful dining experrience|5|The best thing about Gracie's is their incredible food. Everything they put in front of you is a work of art, and tastes better than it looks! The restaurant was crowded and the tables are close together. The service was first rate. Prices are on the high side. All things considered, it's worth every penny.
September 5, 2015|Friendly service a great food.|4|Friendly service a great food.
September 3, 2015|Very impressed|5|Visited for the first time for son's birthday. We each had the prix fixe menu. Service was very professional and impeccable. Server was very knowledgeable and helpful ordering. The food was fresh, attractive and beautifully presented both in plating and serving. Imaginative dishes full of flavor were the rule. Restaurant ambiance was beautiful- simple but nicely decorated and clean. Cocktails were also noteworthy. I had the Vespa, which was so flavorful , but simple. Highly recommend Gracie's. We will be back.
Dined on September 3, 2015|Good Find|4|Gracie's is a short walk from the Hotel Providence, food, ambiance and service was very good. A definite return next time there !
September 1, 2015|Best Restaurant In RI|5|Gracie's is my favorite restaurant in RI. We have been there several times and it is always fabulous. Loved the grilled octopus and scallops with corn!!
September 1, 2015|Better than advertised|5|Multiple friends raved about Gracie's and insisted that I needed to try it. They've never steered me wrong but they've also never failed to capture exactly how amazing a place could be. Even with all the hype I was still shocked with how great of an experience I had. The food was next level in both taste and creativity. The service was flawless, well educated on the menu, smiling and jovial at all times. The timing of everything was planned perfectly. I never felt I was rushed through a course nor did I find myself waiting for the next amazing food experience.
September 1, 2015|BEST IN RI|5|"Gracie's is the BEST restaurant in RI and we have been to almost all...Matt Varga and team do an outstanding job. Steve, the Maitre D runs a tight ship but the servers are all friendly and engaged...""just right"". Christine shines as a bar-tender. Must try her innovative ""non-alcoholic offerings"" as pairings for the tastings and the wine is unique befitting the pairing with the delicious food. Just our ""go to"" restaurant for special occasions to every day just knock it out of the park food and experience. Thank you for making the RI food scene shine. We feel like Ellen (owner)'s family when we go to Gracie's."
August 29, 2015|Gracie's is top of the line|5|The food, service and ambiance of Gracie's are all of consistent high quality. I drive down to Providence from MA South Shore area because Gracie's is so good and in a fun part of Providence. I'd rather go there than into Boston.
August 29, 2015|"My favorite place. Dining is an ""experie..."|5|"My favorite place. Dining is an ""experience"" and little additions make the evenings meal even more special. Waitstaff is always kind and knowledgable without being pretentious. Highly recommended."
August 28, 2015|Fabulous|5|The restaurant went above and beyond to make our dining experience wonderful.
August 27, 2015|Gracie's does not disappoint.|5|Many of the cocktails are made from scratch. The food was delicious and well thought out. The service was attentive and exceptional.
August 26, 2015|better than expected|5|food was awesome and service was even better. my daughter had heard so much about gracies and chose it as the place for her birthday dinner.
August 22, 2015|Selection a little too eclectic, EXCELLENT service|3|"The food variety is great for the adventurous. Unless you're a ""foodie"", you might not recognize the ingredients of the foods unless you Bing searched on it at the spot. Luckily, we did as I thought ""sweetbread"" was some sort of corn bread... boy, THAT would have been a surprise. Look it up. If you're not that adventurous, then you may want to skip this place. Service was EXCELLENT and is clearly a standout in my opinion. We go out to eat a lot even on a work expense account and the service was THAT GOOD. Price was on the high side but you are paying for the service and food preparation. I didn't like the idea of the ""chef tasting"" 3, 5 or 7 course meals where it's up to the chef to select what you eat... no thanks. I prefer the x course meal at Victoria and Alberts at Disneyworld, for instance, where you select each dish you want. At these prices, I prefer NOT to be surprised and I want to know what I'm getting to prevent disappointments. It seems they change the menu often enough that you would want to come back. This was our second visit and we will return. I just wish there was more variety. I was just surprised they didn't have some sort of salmon, sea bass or other type of fish aside from ""cod"". Or at least some other beef main meal. My wife had the scallops which was excellent. I ended up having the rib eye steak since there was really nothing else that appealed to me. Appetizer-wise, I had a lot more choices there and I think I would have been just as happy ordering three appetizers and skipping the main meal. Naming the dishes might be a moot point since they change the menu often enough. But of the appetizers, we had the foie gras, hen's poached egg, and gnocchi. All were excellent. I only gave the restaurant 3 stars this time due to the lack of mail meal selection for me. If the service was just ok, I would have rated them lower. But again, the service and food quality was THAT GOOD."
August 21, 2015|Keeps getting better|5|My wife and I went to Gracie's for our anniversary dinner. We try to go to Gracie's every few months, to treat ourselves to great food and service. It has never disappointed, but on this past visit everything was even better. Every single bite of food was memorable, the wines perfect, and the service throughout the meal was efficient, correct, and also warm and friendly. We have recently had a celebration meal at a very high-end, highly touted Boston restaurant and it just didn't compare. The food, while good and showy, was soul-less and the service was pretentious. And the cost--at least double the cost of Gracie's. Thanks, Gracie's for being our standard.
August 21, 2015|even better than I expected|5|Gracie's was everything I expected it to be and more. It definitely lived up to the reputation I have been hearing and reading about. The food and service were both amazing! The amuse bouche between courses were yummy and a fun surprise.
August 20, 2015|A fantistic evening at a very specail restaurant|5|"Gracie's is a very special restaurant with a place in our hearts. Let me start by saying I am a chef and have been in the business for almost 20 years. Almost 4 years ago, I brought my now wife to Gracie's in a snow storm to try to convince her to move from Palm Beach to be with me, as I was transferred to Rhode Island. Since then we have enjoyed many meals at Gracie's including one 6 months ago, one week before the birth of our fourth child, Gracie! Our dinner last night was perfect, however, very bittersweet, as we are moving to New Jersey this week and it was our ""last supper"" in Rhode Island. We had the seven course tasting menu with wine pairings. It was a showcase of perfectly executed dishes featuring local products with wonderful seasonal produce paired with interesting, unique and esoteric wines. Our server, Sam, was very knowledgeable about the food and wines and we truly enjoyed her attention. We started with an amuse bouche of whipped black pepper ricotta with compressed melon and crispy country ham. Next was a quenelle of Jonah crab salad on a bed of roasted corn and peppers in a tomato water. Housemade raviolis filled Narragansett Creamery cheese (we are going to miss their cheeses!!!) with eggplant, pine nuts and golden raisins were perfection. Seared Hudson Valley foie gras with a blueberry compote and pistachio cake, delicious. Charred octopus (beautifully charred yet moist and tender) paired with an eggplant puree, compressed eggplant and roasted baby tomatoes (my favorite dish!). Duo of duck, which was perfectly cooked and paired with an assortment of fresh local produce. This is when Stephen, the manager, showed up with the pairing of a 2010 Muga Rioja and we started talking wine. A nice cheese course of three ""local"" cheeses was followed by deseert and an assortment of small tastings of unique wines from a SInskey Pinot Gris, a very nice Tokaj and an education from Stephen in Virginia wines. As meal to be remembered."
August 18, 2015|7  course dinner|5|Superb seven course tasting menu was exceptional. Quality , portion size creativity and timing where spot on.

August 14, 2015|Great food and wine!|5|We were there for a special occasion and did the five course tasting menue with the wine pairings. The food was excellent but the highlights were the desserts and the wine. Next time we plan on doing one of the desert tastings, the two we had were fantastic. The sommelier is really personable and picked wines that were not only awesome but really different.
August 14, 2015|Complete perfection|5|My husband and I dined at Gracie's for our wedding anniversary. Everything about the evening was perfection - from the quiet and secluded table we were seated at, to the thoughtful card and beautiful table decorations, to the sparkling wine to start. The chef's tasting menu (we did the 7-course with wine pairing) was absolutely delicious and incredibly innovative with fresh ingredients from their garden mixed with various delicacies from around the country. The service staff was tremendously knowledgeable and everyone was so friendly. We had a perfect evening and will remember this anniversary for years to come.

August 7, 2015|One of the best|5|Took my wife and another couple to dinner this past weekend. Food was excellent, service was very good. Presentation was also excellent. They offered several bread options, the three we tried were all wonderful. Definitely a place that we will go back to. Valet parking was very nice and the cookies that were left in the car were a total surprise (probably shouldn't ruin it for newbies). Sorry we were so full that we did not have them until the next afternoon.
August 7, 2015|Gracie's -- Consistently Great|5|We love going to Gracie's for a special occasion or before a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center. We've taken our special friends here time after time and they also become fans of Gracie's. The food is fresh, creative and delicious. The wine selection is superb. The service is great, from the time you walk through the door until you leave and the friendly valet guy brings you back your car.
August 1, 2015|Not an intimate experience for pleasurable dining|2|Food was good, but the atmosphere was cafeteria quality. Good for groups, but definitely not an intimate setting. Was disappointing in an unpolished assembly line seven course. There was no rhythm for the serving of courses with the wine paring. Probably should have stuck to the three course. Seven seemed too hard for the staff to coordinate. There was only one course where the wine was delivered at the appropriate time; just before the meal was served. Menu selection was unclear. Ended up with dishes that were not acceptable. One dish, the foie gras was outstanding, but the overall tasting experience was blase and inconsistent. The duck pairing was mediocre, the remainder I'd say, they meet their goal with the three course or groups, but fail at the magic they had on Federal Hill. Gracies needs to find a better balance between where they started on Federal Hill and what they wish to achieve off empire. If this is a first for a tasting menu, you are with a large group, or you want a good single dish, then this is for you. Otherwise the expense is not equal to the experience.
July 31, 2015|Creative! An incredible dining experience.|5|Simple, delicious, asthetically pleasing plates made by one of the most talented chefs I've had the pleasure of tasting food from. Chef Matt Varga sources products locally and seasonally and even forages for his own ingredients such as wild mushrooms and wild berries as well as harvesting from his own home garden and the restaurant's rooftop garden. He's vibrant and talented and loves food and loves feeding people who love food. How do I know this? From talking with him! He comes out to visit tables often during the course of your dining experience to chat with his diners personally. Not to ignore the service which was impecible yet friendly. The waiters and runners all knew what each course was about. We were attended to often but not in an interruptive manner, all of them being extrememly responsive and friendly. We had I had the 5 course chef's tasting menu which was superbly done, each course matched perfectly with its own wine pairing. My dining partner agreed that this was indeed a very special meal and that is coming from someone who travels the world for his job and has the opportunity to dine in some of the best dining cities in the world. It was an incredible experience and one that should not be missed by anyone traveling to Providence who loves good food.
July 24, 2015|Always Great|5|Gracie's never fails. Amazing food; we had the gnocchi, then duck - both phenomenal. Highly recommended for a special occasion!

July 16, 2015|Great dinner at the bar!|5|Last Thursday we had dinner at the bar and everything was outstanding. Christy's beet cocktail of the day was fantastic. My husband and I both had the hen egg appetizer which was delicious. I had the appetizer gnocchi for my dinner and my husband had the duck. They were both wonderful. We shared the cheese plate for dessert and it too was wonderful with all the different accompaniments. Our whole meal was A+ and Christy and Caitlin took great care of us. Free valet parking helped too. This was our second visit to Gracie's and we plan to go back many times.
July 15, 2015|Gracies, what happened?|3|"Looked forward to returning to Gracie's after eating there before....although expensive, we feel it's worth our attention (and pocketbook) once in awhile. We frequent Federal Hill, homemade Italian.... As a plus, we visited during Providence week, for $34.95 you received a 3 course meal. First course was a blue cheese salad, gritty w/ sand...no excuse for this. My husband's had to be returned to the kitchen, his second try was gritty as well. BREAD was excellent.....tastings were good. Second course, hubby had fish, he said was very good (striped bass)....I had the pasta dish, pretty mushy for ""fresh"" pasta, comparing it to their counterparts on Federal Hill. My Creme Brulee, and husband's Shortcake dessert was outstanding. Staff accommodating, we were comped wine for salad mishap.......overall, not too excited to return. Gracie's you need to do better"

It did not disappoint, and was just amazing. Service was top notch as usual. Kristi entertained us at the bar prior to dinner with new summer cocktail choices.

June 27, 2015|Excellent|5|We enjoyed our second dinner at Gracie's very much. Service and food are certainly five-star quality.
June 27, 2015|Upscale yet relaxed.|5|Perhaps not what I would have expected in a city with a history of economic depression and a variety of really good Italian places. Gracie's is upscale yet relaxed. Dress up or hip. The menu is well presented with variety yet not overwhelming. The execution of the dishes was right on. The wine list thorough and manageable as well. Save room for desert to share. Can also be romantic--just need a table on the peripheral part of the dinning floor rather than central were they are a bit close together. I'm sure they'll accommodate that request given the high quality throughout our evening.
June 26, 2015|One of my all-time, all-locales favorite restrnts|5|We have gone to Gracie's on several occasions over the years, and have always had a wonderful experience. The food is fantastic, as is the service, wine list, cocktails and ambience. We almost always dine there before a Trinity Rep performance, let the staff know when we make the reservation, and have never been late to the theater, which is across the street. We allways get the 3-course prix fixe. The staff is very knowledgeable about the food and beverages, and the service is quite attentive without being intrusive. I've lived & dined in several large cities, and Gracie's is deinitely one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I love this place!
June 23, 2015|Gracie's is the ideal choice for anyone ...|4|Gracie's is the ideal choice for anyone looking for a relaxed paced dinner featuring seasonal produce and present with artistry. The portions are appropriate to allow you to truly enjoy all three courses. The bread basket is particularly delicious and features their honey glazed beer bread and many other varieties baked in their bakery. $45 for the three-course meal was well worth the experience. My only concern would be that we had four different people waiting on our table and they seemed to rotate frequently.
June 20, 2015|Disappointed|3|So many people gave this restaurant rave reviews.. I have decided that they all have lower expectations than me.. It was a nice place with good food.. But nothing more.. So if you want to spend $300 a couple for an amazing experience.. Don't bother going to Gracie's.
June 20, 2015|Always good.|5|Gracie's is one of our go to places when we finally get a chance to dine out. The food and service are always great. The sweet treat at the end is always terrific.

June 17, 2015|Impeccable dinning experience|5|This was possibly the best overall dining experience I have had. The service was outstanding, the food was delicious and had a beautiful presentation, and the pacing of the meal was in rushed . The extra touches like the palette cleanser of lime and tyme sorbet made for an elegant dining experience.
June 17, 2015|Lovely dinner, great staff|5|Although our dinner was interrupted by a fire alarm (caused by a next-door business), Gracie's staff were unflappable, and had the presence of mind to bring out trays of glasses of bubbly to ease our wait on the sidewalk. All dinners in progress were re-made, and in good time; we made it to our theater performance right on time. Not at all by the way, the quality of the food was just about perfect, as always.
June 11, 2015|salandnancy|5|The service was impeccable.The entire staff was courteous and knowledgable. The food was delicious and what presentation. Great place for theatre goers with valet parking.
Dined on May 27, 2015|The Best in the State|5|No other restaurant can rise to this level of cuisine and service with such consistency. Everything that could ever be expected is exceeded, making the entire dining experience absolutely perfect. There is no better than Gracies.
May 21, 2015|Solid restaurant but slightly disappointing|3|I was very excited to come here because of the amazing reviews on Yelp. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. First, we made a reservation on OpenTable for 6:15 a day or two in advance. I received an email about a half hour before our reservation saying that Gracie's had canceled my reservation. NO PHONE CALL OR EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER. I called several times to rectify the situation, but was sent to an answering machine every time. I left a message but received no response. Around 6, I re-booked a reservation through OpenTable for 6:30, hoping they wouldn't cancel it again. I came in at 6:30, explained the dilemma about our reservation to the hostess, and she offered no apology whatsoever. She simply said we had a reservation at 6:30 and she could take us to our table. It was not busy at 6:30. Most tables were empty, so I am confused as to why they canceled our 6:15 reservation in the first place. I was just having a small graduation celebration dinner with my boyfriend, so it was not too much a of a big deal. But imagine if it was for a bigger occasion or we had driven a long distance to be there. They should have at least informed us on why they canceled and tried to help us reschedule it. Needless to say, it was not a good start to our Gracie's experience. We ordered the prix-fixe 3 course meal for $45 each. The gnocchi was DELICIOUS; I highly recommend it. The baby greens salad was average. The crescent farms duck had too much kumquat for my liking, although my boyfriend loved it. The rigatoni campanero was above average, but not something I would order again. The creme brulee was quite good, and the dark chocolate cake was good. The best parts were the gnocchi and the little treats they gave us between courses. The service was great and the meals were quite intricate, interesting, and above average- but I was expecting amazing; I have definitely had much more satisfying dining experiences in Providence.
May 14, 2015|Great restaurant!|5|A great place for special occasions. We were there early because we had to be at a concert and they were exceptionally good at keeping us on time. The service is exceptional and the food outstanding.
May 10, 2015|Wonderful and very special celebration!|5|We came on Sunday for my husband’s b'day and Mother‘s day celebration. It was 3 of us. On our table we had Happy Birthday card and little silver starts for the b'day celebration. Sparkling Cava was offered as compliment as well. It was very nice celebratory touch. We decided to go with 7-course Chef’s Tasting Menu $95 p/p without wine pairing. We ordered bottles of Alsace Sparkling wine & Super-Tuscan instead. The meal started with amuse bouche–peppered ricotta with peas. It was delicious. 4 different choices of bread served with butter was delicious too . For the 1st course we had crab salad with uni and because of my allergies I had duck liver mousse on toasted brioche. Both were delicious! The presentation of both dishes was amazing. 2nd course pasta course: Artichoke Agnolotti pasta with crispy spek. 3rd course: Seared Foie Gras with morels. 4th course: Halibut with mashed spring p eas, rhubarb & almonds Intermezzo: Citrus-chamomile sorbet 5th course: Veal breast with chanterelles, baby carrots, pasta. 6th course: 3 Cheeses with accoutrements 7th course: Dessert, Pound cake with rhubarb jam & ice cream And finally Mignardises: French Macarons salted caramel with chocolate. Everything was absolutely delicious and presented very nicely with great attention to details, art on the plate. We liked the size of the portion, not too big, not too small. The progression of the meal was great. The dinner took over 3 hours that was fine with us; we enjoyed our family time together. Because of the Mother’s Day all mothers also got a nice box of 2 French Macarons from Ellie’s Bakery. It was very nice touch as well. Service was great: our waiter Jesse as well as everybody else on serving team were very nice & attentive as well as front desk, & the valet with complimentary cookies in cupholder. The atmosphere was great. We enjoyed our dinner very much! Gracie’s is definitely a place for a special celebration. We would highly recommend it and definitely will come again

May 8, 2015|Experience|5|We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and it was a wonderful meal. When we arrived there was a card on our table for us to commend our years together. The entire waitstaff was wonderful. Thank you for making our celebration a wonderful experience.

May 1, 2015|This is our favorite place in Providence...|5|This is our favorite place in Providence, never disappoints.
April 29, 2015|Well worth a visit|4|The pate mousse combined with Madeira wine was magnificent. The steak was excellent, seemed to have smokey flavor, very different and recommended . My spouse is a non drinker so I was not able to evaluate the wine that would be coupled with this entree. Scollops were very good but not the food event the mousse was. Also the reissling wine mated to this entree was not working for me. Cream brûlée was excellent Assortment of confections was very good, but I would opt for the cream brûlée . Coffee was very good. Also of note, the establishment was aware this was a anniversary dinner and had decorated our table very nicely, also provided us with the best table in the house, and a complimentary toast of champagne.( my spouse did have a sip of this even though she generally does not imbibe) Our server was a very sweet girl with a smile that never left her face.
April 24, 2015|Food good but ...|2|The food is good, very good. The ambience is not as good - the space is generally gloomy and it's a mixed bag crowd. And back to the food, much (thinking especially of the liver pate) is presented in a too-cute-to-eat style. Our waiter was overly pretentious.
April 18, 2015|Another unique tasting experience!|4|"My husband and I recently returned to Gracie's with friends to celebrate his birthday. We were seated promptly and enjoyed a wonderful dining meal getting the 7 course tasting meal with wine pairings. The courses were not only delicious, but unique and interesting with beautiful wine combinations to compliment each taste. The only criticism of the evening was the service. Compared to our first experience one year ago, our recent dinner service was subpar. They were pleasant. However, food came before wine for a couple of courses, wine glasses were not changed between a couple of courses and a couple courses needed to be sent back due to special dietary requests (made prior to our visit) that were forgotten. Servers appeared ""off"" and the quality was lacking for what we paid. That said, this was not enough to deter a return and we still highly recommend to others with the hope that the waitstaff can meet the quality of the food in the future."
April 10, 2015|Excellent restaurant|5|All the food was delicious: gnocci, beet salad, duck breast, swordfish, creme brulee, orange upside down cake. I was particularly impressed by the swordfish: not always the most exciting entree, but it was seasoned perfectly, texture was perfect--delicious. Service is pleasant and generally efficient; coffee was delivered late, with apologies it was removed from the check. If I lived in the area, Gracie's would definitely be a go-to restaurant.
April 10, 2015|Impressed|5|Had a perfect evening for our anniversary here. Food was excellent and my duck entree was one of the best dishes I had ever eaten. Definitely would recommend the three course pre-fixe, it filled you up without being too much. They did a great job of spacing out the courses and our meal was well paced. We had a great experience and definitely would love to go back.
April 8, 2015|Great As Always|1|Four of us had a wonderful dinner prior to the theatre. Service & food cannot be beat. One of the, if not the best, in Providence.
April 4, 2015|Hands down the best restaurant in providence.|5|The best restaurant in the area. The food is delectable. I would highly recommend the hudson valley fois gras. The wine list is impressive as well. A great place to bring a date you are trying to impress.
April 3, 2015|Very nice restaurant|4|Great presentation of the food. Great mixed drink menu at the bar
April 3, 2015|Wonderful tasting menu!|5|We celebrated a special occasion, and were not disappointed. We selected the 7 course tasting with wine, which was spot on in every way. The food was beautifully presented and each course was delicious. Of particular note was the interesting and perfectly matched beverage for each course. They mixed it up a bit, including a terrific IPA with one course. Wish I had a takeaway list of what we ate and drank, though. It would have been a wonderful souvenir of a special evening. Service was impeccable, and the ambience was lovely. Noise level was much better than average, which allowed us to converse easily for three hours. We will definitely be back!
April 1, 2015|Creative Tasting Menu|5|Dining gem in Downtown Providence. Went with the 3 course tasting menu, which was reasonable for this level of restaurant at $45. There were so many interesting offerings and ingredients that warrant another visit or two to try all the ones that sounded good.
March 28, 2015|Not as good as last time|3|"We had been to Gracie's once before and thought it was amazing. Unfortunately , after waiting 45 minutes past out reservation and seeing another dining party get seated BEFORE us upon waiting a mere ten minutes , I had lost some of my appetite. In addition, as a vegetarian, dining options are somewhat limited here. Last time, the vegetable platter was amazing, with three separate vegetable dishes. However this time, I was disappointed. I couldn't figure out why one of the ""vegetables"" was buttered pasta. Last time, our experience was special. This time it was confusing and not worth the wait or the bill."
March 28, 2015|amazing|5|at our waiters suggestion we did the five course tasting it was outstanding. This might be the best restaurant I have eaten at.
March 14, 2015|Outstanding food, wine, service|5|very special meal. Had 3 course tasting menu: duck, swordfish wonderful. Would have bee nice to have had more light so we could have appreciated presentation. Even with glasses, server had to bring small light to help reAd the wine list. That said, I will return.
March 14, 2015|Five of the seven courses deserved five stars!|3|We decided to try the seven course tasting menu for the first time. We have done the five course tasting a few times in the past and were excited to add additional courses. The first five courses of the evening were amazing in everyway. Sadly the finale two courses and our after dinner drinks suffered from timing issues and while the food was delicious it was not as enjoyable.
March 13, 2015|Late|2|Showed up for 8pm reservation and we were not seated until 815. Table was not ready. Ordered at 845 after drinks and we were not served for an hour. The waiter acknowledged the delay and was trying to do his best but it got tiring. If you are going to pay 200$ for a dinner you should get much better response time.
March 13, 2015|Amazing Meal for Culinary Student|5|One of the best meals I've ever had and as a Culinary student, it was eye opening and creativity sparking. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and considerate. It was comfortable and laidback but with incredible quality.
March 12, 2015|Anniversary|5|This is going to be our annual anny spot!!! The bread was served in such a charming fashion and the staff was so pleasant
March 12, 2015|Gracie's Shines|5|Gracie's is a star. The cuisine is interesting , delicious and beautifully presented. Service is attentive but never intrusive. I'm always delighted to spend an evening at Gracie's.
March 7, 2015|Disappointing|3|"The 5 course dinner was presented as the Chef picking special things for the table of 4. The Prix-fixe dinner was $45, The 5 course $80. The food was OK but portions were tiny. The rub was that 3 of the 5 courses were on the Prix-Fixe menu and we essentially paid $35 apiece for a 1 inch piece of tuna (#1) and 3-4 inch piece of grouper(#4). Service was very slow. I think what the chef ""specially"" made for us was what was around in his kitchen and not special at all. Would not go back."
March 7, 2015|Romantic Evening|5|Memorable evening spent at Gracie's to celebrate my wife's B-day. Beet salads were eye catching and excellent; swordfish grilled to perfection and juicy; spicy sausage rigatoni truly tasted homemade; and deserts of Creme brule and hazelnut panne cotta were decadent. We had signed up for wine parings with each course which were expertly matched. Ambience & Service excellent!

March 4, 2015|Special Occasion Dinner|5|Exceptional meal and elegant presentation! Wonderful flavors and superb service. Will be back again with friends.
February 28, 2015|Great place to dine and romantic time.|5|Had a romantic dinner at Gracie's to celebrate an anniversary. The service was excellent. Great wine selection. I chose to have the 5 course pre selected dinner without the wine pairings. Next time I would have chosen the pairings. The food was excellent, I was especially excited for the venison loin chop which was delicious. Would recommend this place to anyone.
February 28, 2015|Prix Fixe menu is a great deal.  The foo...|4|Prix Fixe menu is a great deal. The food is outstanding. So many flavor combinations I would never imagine could be good together just melt in your mouth. The small intermezzos are a nice touch and always delicious. The cocktails are very creative and delicious as well. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion date night. Everything about the restaurant just seems to be done right.
February 27, 2015|This was simply an outstanding experienc...|5|This was simply an outstanding experience. Every aspect was well done. Special thanks to Anthony, our valet, for his kind approach and help!
February 20, 2015|Nice atmosphere...|5|Pretty little place, very attentive and the food was glorious. A gastronomic delight, albeit a little more than we usually spend for a date night. The extra personal touches made it worth a revisit another time.
February 20, 2015|Food was amazing, service was not amazing.|3|The food was amazing, however the service was spotty. Two of the three of us had ordered wine and received wine, however one was deciding; server neglected to return to ask him for his wine choice. Then dessert was served and no one had asked us before or after if we wanted coffee, so we were half way through dessert before coffee arrived.
February 17, 2015|Excellent food, we had the pre-fix, exce...|5|Excellent food, we had the pre-fix, excellent value, and outstanding service.
February 6, 2015|Outstanding Experience!|5|We had never eaten at Gracie's but read of its reputation for excellent food and superb service. Both proved to be true. We thought the wait staff were knowledgable and extremely attentive to how we paced ourselves. No plates were removed until we were both finished each course. That alone is the mark of excellence in our minds. We look forward to many dining experiences at Gracie's in the future.
February 4, 2015|not usual gracies caliber|3|I have very high standards for gracies. Would have given an overall 3.5 if I could. Usually the food here blows me away. We did 9courses paired with wine. Presentation was beautiful across the board. 4 of the dishes were tremendous (best being steak tartare which was the first :( ), 4 were just OK and lacking in flavor profile dimensions and the beef tendon was just flat out disappointing. The dessert they brought, while beauitful, was really just a glorified mini muffin. The.banana tort they brought after we said something was delicious! Service was wonderful, ambiance was nonexistent. I would definitely go back gracies is my favorite restaurant in the ri/ma they are usually 5star worthy with food I think we just caught them on an off night.
February 4, 2015|Food|3|Gracie's has been my favorite Providence restaurant, but the appetizer and main course were disappointing this week. I hope it was just an off night.
Dined on January 31, 2015|Lovely evening|5|I love to dine out, and this was among the more outstanding experiences I've had lately. Everything was delicious; service was friendly and knowledgeable; the amuse bouche and palate cleansers were great fun. Leisurely, interesting, delightful.
January 31, 2015|An absolute gem.|5|We just have to tell them that we will have the 5 courses with wine pairing and they delight us for the rest of the evening.
January 30, 2015|One of the best|5|It was dinner out to celebrate our 33rd anniversary. Gracie's is the perfect choice. The chef brought out a pre-dinner taste treat, then cocktails, and a first course followed with a palate cleanser. The main courses were excellent and well prepared. Presentation was beautiful as was dessert. When leaving the restaurant there were cookies in our car left by the valet.
January 28, 2015|Ahh, Gracies!|4|We love Gracies, and last night was no exception. We must have had a new waiter though. There were several lapses, although, to be expected, other staff picked up the slack when it counted, and we needed to leave in order to get to a show. This is the only reason I downgraded the service from my usual 5 stars. The newbie will get better, and join the rest of the stellar staff, or for sure, he'll be gone. I'm rooting for him.
January 24, 2015|An experience for all food and wine lovers.|5|Steph and Travis were extremely helpful during our first visit at Gracie's. They were extremely attentive and a pleasure to have as service for the evening. I mentioned in my Open Table reservation that I was planning a special night for my girlfriend, and they didn't take that lightly. On arrival, they showed us to an intimate booth/table, tucked away from the open seating area of the restaurant. The table was perfectly decorated, and they provided us with a complimentary toast before we even got to our menus. Incredible. Gracie's is the type of place you won't ever forget, and their staff plays a huge role in that fact. The 5 course meal with wine pairing is a no brainer for any foodie. Overall we had a wonderful time, and will go back! Thank you to Steph, Travis, and the entire Gracie's staff!
January 21, 2015|main dish amazing|4|I had the duck breast cooked perfectly medium rare and delicious. Au jus could have benefited from less salt, but that was it. First dish was roasted beets with light French cream cheese and citrus which was very good. Dessert was a lemon based cake with compote and other ingredients. Dessert was not up to par with the rest of the food and very disappointing. Cake was very dry and flavors did not go together well. My wife had a dish of gnocchi to start that was good. The sauce was like a reduction of chicken stock with butter and Parmesan. She also had the excellent duck breast and her dessert was also disappointing.
January 20, 2015|recommend with some restrictions|4|went for restaurant week-apparently the prix fixe menu for that occasion was the same as always offered but with a lower price for restaurant week -the food is innovative-and delicious-combinations interesting enough to attract foodies but not so strange as to put off non foodies-nice touches not found most places-amuse bouche, a little macaroon with the check. -overall the place is an expensive outing that only works for me for restaurant week -I was put off by the restaurant's policy of automatically seating a 1 person reservation at the bar-I will say that when I arrived I was offered the option of a table (and there were plenty available)-but I was offended that because I was by myself I would not be seated at a table unless I asked for it-strange policy that feels discriminatory to single diners

January 17, 2015|21st birthday|5|It was our daughter's choice of restaurant for her 21st birthday! Every step taken to make it a happy one was there from the choice of table, to service, to food and atmosphere! Would recommend it to all our friends who enjoy going out and paying for what you get! Thanks so much for a great evening! Her comment: flawless!
January 17, 2015|Best Restaurant in Rhode Island|5|We were very impressed with our visit to Gracie's. The food was excellent; it was clear that the seafood was very fresh. The portions were quite large, which surprised us for such an upscale restaurant. What makes Gracie's stand out, though, is the service. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly, and you really feel taken care of. The sense that this is an upscale restaurant is reinforced by all the small things: amuse-bouches, sorbert, and so on. It is a pleasure to dine here.
January 16, 2015|Spectacular evening at Gracies|5|Outstanding dinner, spectacular service and great ambiance was our evening at Gracies....food was spectacular....outstanding presentation....can't wait to go back...
January 16, 2015|You must go!|5|Make reservations well ahead; it is very popular, even when frigid out. The food is sublime; the bar terrific. My companion chose to have the waiter/sommelier determine the wines for each course, including a dessert wine and a port after dinner while I had my cappucino. Everything we ate was sublime. I wish my stay in Providence were longer and my waistline slimmer, I'd like to have had a few days to try several items I had no chance to sample. I had a rib eye perfectly cooked with a dollop of truffle/pate on the side. OMG!
January 16, 2015|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!|5|Went to Gracie's for first time while overnighting in Providence. What a treat it was. Food was all melt in your mouth good. Service was also top notch. If the wallet could take it, I would be a regular...
January 16, 2015|Favorite in Providence|5|Gracie's is our favorite restaurant in Providence. The food is superb, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is relaxing. We drive an hour just to enjoy a wonderful evening there. We recommend this restaurant very highly.
January 15, 2015|We had the three course fixed price menu...|5|We had the three course fixed price menu for restaurant week, and almost everything was excellent. The food and service were outstanding as always. The only criticism would be the final wine pairing with the creme brulee, a very sweet sherry. I have a major sweet tooth, but the combination of the creme brulee and the sherry was just too sweet. The creme brulee was great, and the other wine pairings with the gnocchi and the duck were perfect. I would have liked more of the sparking Shiraz that was paired with the duck with the creme brulee, what a tasty wine!
January 15, 2015|Gracie's Review during Restaurant Week.|4|We ate here during restaurant week, and have eaten here in the past. I would rate this place an 8 out of 10. Everything was top notch, except for one thing: I ordered the duck. When our meal was served, my duck appeared a bit rare, in fact it was rare. The new thing now is to have some meals served somewhat rare, like chicken, but I'm not one of those kind of people who go with the trend of the moment. Maybe it was supposed to be served that way, but it was not to my liking/taste. Our waitress did not appear for a while, maybe about 10 to 15 minutes. We noticed her waiting other tables, as needed, but failed to check upon us. Please do not tell me I should have called her over or someone else as all staff was busy working about; that is the waiters job. She never once glanced our way. I sat back during this time and another staff person approached our table and asked if we were all set while attempting to take our plates. My husband had finished his dinner. I said I was waiting to see our waitress so I can send my meal back because it was rare for me. This person took it back to the kitchen. Several minutes later, our waitress came by and I explained what happened. My meal arrived a bit later, and it was delicious. All in all, we will come back soon.
January 14, 2015|Outstanding|5|Food is spot on, team service means exceptional timing, restaurant week prices is an outstanding way to try this superb restaurant and consider your next special event. Has come a long way from its roots on the Hill to a top go to restaurant in a vibrant city scene.
January 14, 2015|WOW|5|FROM BEGINNING TO END, A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE WITH EXCELLENT FOOD, SERVICE AND A SENSE OF PRIVACY IN OUR BOOTH. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS IF YOU'VE BEEN TO OTHER RESTAURANTS IN THE PROVIDENCE AREA MORE THAN ONCE. BE PREPARED TO SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA AND ORDER SOME OF THE SPECIALS!
January 13, 2015|A perfect meal for a special occasion!|5|The food was exquisitely prepared and presented, from the first course of roasted beets with cloumage and candied kumquat to the duck with barley and cranberries to the final dessert course - I had the creme brulee. Amuse-bouches included pear sorbet and macarons. Wine pairings were explained in detail but in a way that was thoughtful and not arrogant. Furthermore, as it was my birthday, all of the staff wished me happy birthday and made my evening a truly special one. This was easily one of the best - if not the best - meals I've had in Providence, and the service was outstanding.
January 10, 2015|Gracie's was exceptional.|5|Gracie's was exceptional. The food was delicious and the service was on point. We had a birthday within our party and I mentioned only that in the online reservation. They went above and beyond with a special table, note for the birthday girl, champagne toast. It was incredible. This is definitely your go-to place for excellent food, impeccable service and special occasions!
January 7, 2015|One of the best meals I've ever had.|5|There are many prix fix multi-course menus, but we tried the chef's blind tasting menu. It was amazing. Every course was fantastic. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, especially about the wine list. There were many interesting wine options.
December 28, 2014|Creative dishes that are so delicious!|5|This was our first time at Gracie's - the food was amazingly delicious! We opted for the five course tasting menu and each one was excellent. The flavors and presentation were exquisite. The service was very good - very knowledgeable staff who take the time to explain every course and answer any questions. The passionfruit gelato was divine -- brought us back to the Caribbean. Unfortunately we live quite a distance and didn't have the luxury of a designated driver, so we were unable to try the wine pairings. The table next to us did have the pairings and the offerings were great. Gracie's has an EXTENSIVE wine list. Cannot wait to return!
December 19, 2014|Nice pre-show restaurant|3|Ordered from the 3 course prix fixe menu. Selection limited, but food was very good. Waitstaff attentive but wine ordered with entree course arrived after my husband was finished his meal. Apologized but blamed busy bar. Our reservations were for 5:30, and we were out in plenty of time to make concert at The Dunk.
December 19, 2014|Festive Food for a Festive Season|5|Gracie's delivers year after year on great food with great service. We made our family's yearly trip to Gracie's for a pre-show dinner. The 5 course tasting menu with wine selections was outstanding. Our son has a severe allergy and the staff were able to accommodate us, providing delicious alternatives to one of the planned courses. The ambiance is festive, the food delicious and beautiful, the pacing of the meal comfortable and unhurried, and the overall experience remarkable. Well done, once again! Gracie's hits it out of the park.
December 18, 2014|Awesome|5|My friends have been recommending this place for years, and I have never gotten the chance to visit. I finally got the chance to try it out, and let me just say that it lives up to the hype. I had a five-course tasting menu, and everything was excellently-paired and delightful. Service was absolutely top-notch. If you haven't tried out, I can't recommend enough giving it a try. I personally will be revisiting and giving their seven-course a shot next.
December 12, 2014|Another outstanding evening.  Dinner was...|5|Another outstanding evening. Dinner was great. The service and entertainment at the bar with Kristi, was amazing. We cannot think of anything to change.
December 11, 2014|Excellent in many dimensions.|5|Lives up to its reputation as being one of Providence's top restaurants.
December 6, 2014|Phenomenal!|5|Gracie's has always been our choice for an exquisite meal with service beyond expectations. From the always unique muse bouche to our delicious apps of foie gras and gnocchi, to the perfectly prepared entrees of a pork chop and a ribeye steak and ending with the complementary French macroons, the meal was superb in every way.
December 5, 2014|Service, atmosphere, cuisine, all sublime!|5|"Attentive service that is expert and warm, without being over-familiar or pretentious. Hits just the right balance. The team concept of service is executed nicely. No up-selling or such. The service helps to create an atmosphere that matches the quality of the food. We enjoyed the five-course tasting menu with wine pairing and it was exceptional. Creative and getting at times near ""the edge"" without falling off of the edge of dishes that are varied in flavorings but coherent -- too often in other places there's a riot happening on the plate. Worth the journey, to engage in understatement."
December 5, 2014|Wonderful Anniversary experience!|5|"Highly recommended by a trusted friend, I made dinner reservations at Gracies for our first anniversary, as we were headed to Trinity Rep for a show afterwards. We we greeted with a ""Happy Anniversary"" from our hostess, shown to a private booth that was decorated with silver stars, a lovely card, and given complimentary champagne and other treats throughout our meal. The pacing was great, friendly and knowledgeable service, and the food was just perfect. Portions were on the small side, but the whole experience was really special. We'll definitely be back! Thank you!"
December 3, 2014|Lovely meal!|5|I decided on Gracie's (my first visit there) to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was a wise choice. They made a big fuss over the celebration, decorating the table with silver sparkles and a birthday card. As if that weren't enough, they offered us a complementary flute of cava to kick off our evening. The dessert arrived with a candle (yes, I was expecting that), but it was a trick candle that cannot be blown out, another treat! The food was outstanding. I recommend the scallops crudo with passion fruit foam as an appetizer, and the duck breast for an entree. Service was professional, attentive, and brisk. I am now a loyal fan of Gracie's! To top it off, we received a coupon for a discount in January. Our entire experience top notch!
December 2, 2014|Friendly AND Delicious|5|From the amuse bouche to the palate clearing passion fruit sherbet, everything was slightly over the top but so warm and friendly that we couldn't be annoyed. A great time on a drizzly cold evening in downtown Providence.
December 2, 2014|Great Prix Fixe dinner|5|Extremely reasonable 3 course dinner. Plenty of choices. Great amuse bouche and delicious sorbet palate cleanser.
November 29, 2014|Amazing|5|Everything about Gracie's was exceptional. The bar service was great and cocktails were delicious. We opted for the 3 course prix fixe menu and were more than pleased with everything we received. The gnocci and duck were like nothing I've ever eaten before. We loved how seriously the chef seems to take the menu. All of the special intermezzos were awesome. Looking forward to trying the blind tasting some time in the future. would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a new special occasion/date night spot.
November 29, 2014|Perfect pre-theater restaurant|5|Also a special place to go. Even though we arrived a half hour early for our dinner reservation, we told our server, Brian, what time we wished to leave for the theater and he paced our meal perfectly. Excellent service, outstanding food and the perfect location. What more could you ask for???!!!
November 29, 2014|Loved our chefs tasting with pairing!!|5|What a lovely experience. Gracie's made my daughters birthday wonderful from start to finish. The chef took very good care of me as well, making sure my plates were onion and garlic free due to a severe food allergy. The wine pairings were perfect and the chefs tasting delicious. Thanks for a wonderful time!
November 28, 2014|The Place to go Pre-Trinity Theater|4|I have loved Gracie's for a long time and always dined here prior to attending an event at Trinity. The staff at Gracies understand the early dining crowd is headed there and keeps service on track so you arrive on time for the curtain. I Was a bit disappointed in the meal I ordered but I can't blame Gracies for my choices. The one surprise and real disappointment was that when I ordered coffee after dinner they were out of cream! So I didn't get to enjoy coffee and there was no time for dessert.
November 26, 2014|What a Treat!|5|We have attended many theatrical performances across the street, and we had heard about Gracie's, but this was our first time dining there...and it won't be our last! Everything about it was great, except for the stormy weather, but it didn't dampen our enjoyment at all. Attentive wait staff kept our water glasses full (very important, since we drink a lot of water). Four kinds of tasty bread were offered, not once, but twice. There were 3 offerings of amuse bouche during the evening. Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated: beet salad, lobster and squash soup, fish, rib eye steak, creme brulee, chocolate torte. I couldn't possibly recommend it any higher, unless we had more than 5 stars!
Dined on November 22, 2014|One of the Best Meals We've Ever Had!!!|5|We celebrated our anniversary at Gracie's and it was one of the best meals we've had. We were going to try the tasting menu but opted to choose our own selections instead and they were fantastic! First we had the Beet and Ricotta salad with Endive and Hens Egg over Pork Belly that were amazing. I chose the Scallop entree served with a variety of veggies and pork belly and my husband got the beef medallions that were incredible. For dessert we share the cheese platter that was off the charts. My only negative score was for the service which was mediocre and not on par with the food but I'd RUN back to Gracie's in a heartbeat!!!!
November 22, 2014|Always Excellent!|5|"Outstanding service and great food. Our party of 4 all took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu. I ordered duck, others had the haddock. Food was beautifully prepared...the taste exceptional. Though I never advocate for extraordinarily large sized portions, like many ""food as art"" establishments, I believe the portions could be a tad more generous...particularly the ""fixins"" accompanying the main entree. The meal was otherwise outstanding."
November 22, 2014|Great experience...but don't be in a rush.|5|This was one of the best eating experiences I've had in some time. My wife and is each had the 3 course Prix Fixe menu. We also had a cheese plate to start. The food was excellent. From the 1st course all the way through the 3rd. We got the wine pairing with the menu. The list was great. Not too large to be overwhelming but large enough and diverse enough for experienced wine people on any budget. The one downside of the meal was that the time between courses was very long. For our entire dinner we started at 6:45 and didn't finish eating until 9:45. In at least one case we waited 30 minutes between courses. We were having a wonderful time so we didn't mind, but definitely something to be aware of if ou of are on a schedule.
November 22, 2014|Great food!|5|Disappointed that I couldn't do the Chef's blind tasting menu due to several guests with food allergies. Will have to come back to do the tasting menu. Overall, food and service was very good. Restaurant is a little louder than I prefer.
November 21, 2014|Nice Meal|4|I took my fiancé here for his birthday. We did the prix fixe $40 menu plus the wine pairing and it was perfect. I loved the card and little sprinkled stars they put around the table for his birthday. Overall, Gracie's has to be one of the best in Providence.
November 21, 2014|Special Place best service and food|5|First time but not our last time to go to Gracie's especially for special occasions we did the 5 course tastings with wine pairings. It was the most creative special meal. It is expensive so not a weekly eatery. We were sat in aThis charming little booth for two which was even more special for our anniversary. To boot, when the valet left the car there were two homemade cookies to thank us for coming. Everything is thought of and you are well taken care of fro the staff.
November 18, 2014|A very special dining experience|5|The food is exquisite. Come and experience it for yourself. This is true dining, the food is so carefully, tastefully and beautifully prepared. This is where you want to go for any special occasion! This is the best restaurant in Rhode Island!
November 15, 2014|Expected a lot and only got a little|1|"I have to give Gracie's a poor review. Reasons: 1) 9:30 reservation. We didn't sit down until 10:15. This is totally unacceptable. Especially when there is a 25$ charge if I no show on the reservation. 2) Got menu and pleasant waitress went over food selection. Came back to take order and I'm suddenly told you can't due the tasting menu unless everyone at the table orders it. Now I can understand this to some point (with huge groups) - but it's just me and my wife...does it really matter if you are cooking 1 or 2 of the tastings? Plus the 2 people at the table next to us were eating the tasting menu, can't they just make mine with theirs? Ok bummer but I got over it. 3) Order the pork dinner. Wait 30 minutes (now almost 11pm) and told they are out of the pork dinner. Advised to try lamb shank - so I order it 4) Gnocchi first course was excellent. Lamb shank not so good. The meat ""fell off the bone"" and there was an excellent sauce with the dish. Saying this - the meat was pretty chewy (much more than other lamb I've had) and didn't have a lot of flavor. So, for the the high price we paid for dinner I very much think it wasn't worth it. We ate an excellent meal for 1/3 the price at locations only a 10 minute walk away. Save your money and time and head away from Gracie's."
November 15, 2014|Run for the hills!|1|Special occasion night so we ordered the five course tasting menu with matching wines. Run for the hills next time you see a tasting menu. You'll be hungry when your done, several hours later and several hundred dollars poorer. Portions were tiny, we kept asking for more bread. Nothing especially special on the plate too. There is no menu - it is the chefs choice and he surprises you. By course three, my husband was asking me to use my phone to check out other places to eat and what time they closed. Service wasn't attentive either. Wine poured was about 1 ounce per course. Really!
November 15, 2014|Best Dining Experience|5|This was by far the best dining experience & freshest, best tasting food my husband & I ever experienced. Everything was amazing! The waitstaff was wonderful as well!
November 14, 2014|Was really looking forward to Gracie's|4|While a beautiful space to be sure, and the food was very good, we definitely felt the wait staff were off, and too many mistakes were made throughout the meal to not notice. The appetizers were very good, with lots of taste sensations happening, and mine really brought a smile to me. I loved the complexity of the vegetables and whatever the concoction was surrounding my scallops. I ordered the beef entree, and it was perfectly done(med rare). It had an asian feel to it, sesame taste. Nice. My wife liked her halibut, but her favorite was the creme brûlée, about the best she's ever had. Going to a place like this everything should be fantastic, as it's a premium priced eatery, and something to talk about when we get home from vacation. Unfortunately, I found the food to be just pretty good, but nothing at all to rave about, but more importantly the service was definitely mediocre. Having a waiter try and take care of different tables on two floors doesn't work, and having a server seemed annoyed, as opposed to apologetic when pointing out the used glass just doesn't sit right with us. I will say that while loud, the decor is beautiful, and we loved sitting with the high fabric couches. By the way, the 10 year old Madeira which was paired with my dessert had to be a highlight of the night. Unbelievably delicious.
November 13, 2014|Always a Grace!|5|Gracie's never disappoints. We were entertaining friends from out of town on the spur of the moment and ordered a good Malbec and the 3 course prix fixe. It was all just delicious, cod tender and fragrant, gnocchi that melted with the flavors of sauce, beet salad that looked like art, and duck leg confit that was scrumptious. The coffee caramel chestnut tart was perhaps one notch better than the Cloumage cheesecake but others might argue the point. The closing macaroons melted in our mouths without eclipsing the memory of the tomato sour dough bread. Just delicious!
November 13, 2014|Chef's Tasting was awesome|5|My wife and I went to Gracie's to celebrate her birthday and opted for the Chef's tasting menu (7 courses) paired with wine. It was awesome!! The chef certainly knows how to develop flavors. My wife had a corn soup that was her favorite course and I had a ravioli in mushroom sherry sauce that was amazing. All courses were great. We will definitely be back.
November 13, 2014|"Gives new meaning to ""special"" occasion"|5|As always, Gracie's was wonderful, and made our daughter's 30th birthday a night to remember! From the amuse bouche to the last bite of dessert, a delicious dinner. The Prix Fixe menu makes it an affordable splurge.
November 11, 2014|New York should be Jealous!!|5|First time in Providence with my wife. We had dinner at this amazing restaurant that is just as good or better than the top New York City restaurants. My wife and I loved the food and service was very good. I would highly recommend this restaurant for foodies and romantic dinner.
November 8, 2014|Pure Pleasure!|5|Gracie's is a gem in Providence..well worth the drive from Connecticut.we were celebrating our fortieth anniversary and my birthday and the wait staff wished us well as they seated us at our window table .. Outstanding! Each course was presented with finesse and tasted so fresh. Courses were served at a comfortable pace. From corn chowder with poached lobster, to the sample cheese platter. Bravo, to Matt and the whole staff for helping make our celebration so memorable.
November 8, 2014|Wonderful!|5|Love everything about this restaurant - food - ambiance and service!
November 7, 2014|We ate at the bar because out table was ...|5|We ate at the bar because out table was not ready. It ended up being perfect. The bartenders were amazing and we ended up have a wonderful time. You must go. AMAZING
November 7, 2014|special dinner spot!|5|we went here for my husband's birthday and it was a great evening. from the celebratory complimentary champagne and table decor for his bday to the service and of course the food, everything was awesome. the service was gracious, polite and timely. the food was creative, unique and so delicious! we felt special and taken care of the whole evening. the only downside was sitting in the banquet seating against the windows which put us very close to the tables on either side and made it seem a little less private than desired. but next time we will just request a free-standing table. definitely would recommend this place for a special occasion or just a lovely night out.
November 7, 2014|Amazing|5|Went with my girlfriend for dinner. Had the 7 course tasting menu. It was absolutely amazing. Each plate was better than the next. The creativity and plating was top notch. The flavor was mind blowing. The service was super professional and very attentive. I love this place.
November 5, 2014|Tasting Menu|5|We had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing and it was excellent. A non-drinker in the group asked for non-acoholic cocktails paired with the courses and they were remarkable.
November 1, 2014|Better than I remembered|4|This is one of my wife's favorite restaurants, and I have been indifferent to the food and found the prices high - but I did have the best duck I've ever eaten on Saturday night, and we enjoyed our evening. We had a waitperson in training and service was a little slow; however it was a really busy night. Overall, I'm glad we ate at Gracie's and I will go back.
November 1, 2014|7 course chef tasting menu & wine|5|It's a bit pricey ($280 for 2, incl tax), but what a treat! The chef picks the courses, usually to include a cold appetizer, fois gras, cheese, seafood, meat, pasta, and desert. Sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are perfectly sized. Each dish we had was amazing, and we couldn't have enjoyed the evening more!
October 31, 2014|Good but not Great|3|"I always go to Gracie's when I am in Providence and I always enjoy the food. This particular visit was a bit ""off"" -- the service was not as smooth. It was Halloween night and perhaps some ghosts and goblins had gotten into the place."
October 31, 2014|Tasting menu superb|5|We had the seven-course tasting menu and each bite was wonderful and inventive.
October 29, 2014|Great food even better service|5|We we arrived early and sat at the bar for a couple of cocktails. Our bartender was very pleasant and was guite knowledgeable about not only the various liquors but the foods as well. We decided to eat at the.bar and were not disappointed. Dinner was fabulous and the service was great. This was not our first visit and the restaurant never disappoint s.
October 28, 2014|Providence's Culinary Gem|5|If you are looking for the best prepared food in Providence, you have to include Gracie's on that list. While it often seems overlooked by national pundits, the food is exquisite, the service impeccable and the cocktails are wonderful too. Our meal was terrific and left us wondering why we hadn't been more often. A $40 price fix is actual a great deal.
October 24, 2014|FLOWERS NOT DELIVERED|2|THE FLOWERES ORDERED WERE NOT DELIVERED. THE CREDIT CHARGE APPEARS TO BE INCORRECT DISPITE BRINGING TO WAITRESS ATTENTION AND ISSUANCE OF NEW BILL. $276.48 ON A 142.56 BILL
October 22, 2014|Lived up to its press...|5|Wow! What a fabulous dining experience. Had heard many wonderful things about Gracie's and everything I heard was well warranted. Highly recommend doing one of the two tasting menus, with paired wines. From start to finish, the evening was perfectly executed. The pace was just right, the food was delicious and varied, the wines were very complementary and the service was exactly the way it should be. Loved the atmosphere, too.
October 18, 2014|Gracie's is a very elegant restaurant lo...|5|Gracie's is a very elegant restaurant located in downtown Providence. It came highly recommended. The food and service were excellent. I had the sweetbreads and the duck and both were delicious. An interesting selection of local spirits for your cocktails if you want to be adventurous. We look forward to dining here again!
October 18, 2014|Disappointed|2|For my first time I was so disappointed. We had the 5 tasting plates. The food was good but the service was awful. I had the wine pairing with mine and they served 2 of the wines when I was already finished with each of the courses. I would not recommend the wine tastings!!
October 18, 2014|Poor service|3|Not the level of service that you would expect for a restaurant like this. I was trying to take a group out for a special dinner and wanted it to be my treat. To avoid haggling over the check at the end, I called before we arrived and specially requested that bill be placed on my card on file. I was assured this would be no problem. In order to be sure everything went smoothly, I again made this request when we arrived- Again assured this was no problem BUT when bill arrived at the end it was clear no one had paid any attention to my request and there was the bill placed on the table like none of these conversations had even happened. I was disappointed that my special gift was ruined and I was left arguing with the others to let me pay.
October 16, 2014|Wonderful find|5|I came in from out of town and found Grace online. It met all expectations. The food was fantastic. I had the scallops and I can say they were the best scallops I've ever had. And the chocolate tart brought a smile to my face, amazingly good. Try it with a sip of a full body red wine.
October 16, 2014|First time won't be the last|5|Would not have changed a thing. We had a very cozy and private table with an amazing wait staff. Completely impressed with their attention to detail (freshly ironed napkins and tablecloths!). We put our trust in the chef for a surprise 5 course meal and it was phenomenal. Will not hesitate to return next time in Providence. Thank you for a wonderful night.
October 11, 2014|Superior Experience|5|From the complementary valet parking to the pastries left in the car when we left the restaurant, everything - food, service, ambiance, menu selections, and wine list were outstanding. This is a must do dining experience when visiting Rhode Island's Providence region.
October 11, 2014|Great anniversary dinner!|4|The service was superb. Extremely accommodating for my celiac disease (no gluten). Food was great and the best creme brûlée ever, and I have had a lot!
October 11, 2014|Fine|4|An ok restaurant, some bright spots, but in my book doesn't live up to the glowing reviews. The service is just ok... timing was a bit off, first courses arriving seconds after the amuse. Service staff seemed a bit stretched... took long while to place our order. The ambiance is nice, like the lighting a lot... and the bar area. Food was just ok... not on the highest level of fine dining that I expected from the many reviews... I found the food to be more hearty, lacking finesse. The pork chop was the weak... undercooked, tough. Took only a couple of bites and had some of the nice vegetables served with it... when cleared, no asking if there was a problem. The pastry chef was the bright spot... really excellent deserts.
October 11, 2014|Gracie's Deserves its Rep|5|Gracie's has developed a reputation as the best restaurant in Rhode Island and neighboring Massachusetts, and the equal of any restaurant anywhere, for good reason. Attentive service. Your plate is removed as soon as you are done with the course, but you are not rushed. Next course comes quickly. Every waiter and waitress can explain every dish, and the recipes are elaborate and complex. The food is imaginative and the wine selection excellent. Be prepared to pay for the quality you receive -- approximately $150 per person with one cocktail, a glass of wine, and a full supper.
October 10, 2014|Great food and service|5|Excellent menu, delicious food and well-trained, knowledgeable and attentive staff.
October 10, 2014|Providence Highlight|5|We came in as a group of 8 on a Friday evening, and ordered from the prix fixe menu, some of us opted for the wine pairing. Food was delicious, wines were interesting and the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Dined on October 10, 2014|My favorite in PVD!|5|Gracies is the place to be, the food so delicious, service so attentive, and everything so perfect! I keep on going back!
October 10, 2014|Prix fixe is a great deal. Both the mark...|5|Prix fixe is a great deal. Both the market fish (sea bass) and the duck were very good. My starter, the potato gnocchi, was outstanding. Desserts were good. Sometimes there are too many people swirling around the table but service is generally good.
October 7, 2014|Special Treatment|5|We dined at Gracie's for our 19th anniversary and notified the restaurant of the occasion through OpenTable. From the moment we arrived we were treated as VIPs. We were escorted to an intimate table where special celebratory touches awaited. We chose the 5 course tasting menu paired with wine. The pace was just right - we did not feel rushed but we did not wait long between courses. The food quality and creativity was exceptional. The portions were not large, but at the end of the evening we did not leave hungry. Generally the wines paired with each course did not enhance the experience, but each course was such a collage of flavors pairing was a challenge. Will definitely return to enjoy the main menus, both food and wine.
October 7, 2014|Consistently great|5|When I don't want to be disappointed Gracies is my restaurant of choice for special occasions, or to take out of town foodies. The food is consistently delicious.
October 4, 2014|Ok,  BUT could've been great.|3|Terrible social skills and the lack of communication between the hostess, the bar staff and the manager of the front led to a very awkward and unpleasant start to the evening with my wife and me being seated at the worst table in the house. Once we got away from the grumpy and rude people at the front, we were treated very well by the wait staff assigned to our table. The real shame is they have a nice place, a nice bar and could really have shown us a great time; but we wont be back.
October 4, 2014|Amazing!|5|The five course chef tasting was beyond our expectations. Each course was a complete surprise and presented by the very knowledgeable staff. Each plate was as pretty as it was delicious! The service was impeccable.
October 3, 2014|Great anniversary dinner|5|Requested quiet table for anniversary. Ordered flowers to be delivered. Got to restaurant and they said Happy Anniversary. Took us to our table and the flowers were on table in a nice quiet corner of the restaurant with a note from the restaurant saying Happy Anniversary. Started us out with a glass of Complimentary Champagne for a toast and brought over a complimentary appetizer to get us started. The entire evening was excellent and the food and service is outstanding. I returned for this reason and wasn't disappointed. I will return again in the future.
September 27, 2014|Culinary Masterpiece|5|We got the tasting menu and each course was beautifully presented, served and prepared. Incredibly fresh ingredients and creative approach.
September 26, 2014|Special occasion|5|Took my wife to dinner for her birthday. The food was amazing as always and the special attention from the waitstaff was really fantastic. We love Gracies for their service and food, but they really went above and beyond to give my wife a special treat.
September 23, 2014|An Evening To Be Remembered|4|Stellar was the food, service and experience. Drinks served with orchids. Had a wonderful birthday celebration here. Would return again. Chef Matt Vargas and company conjure the magical in this dynamic atelier.
September 20, 2014|Outstanding food!|4|Had the 5 course with wine pairing. Food was outstanding, wine pairings okay (too many sparkling choices), service friendly but not par to the level of such excellent cuisine!
September 20, 2014|Food was exquisite!|5|Very impressed with eveything. We thought the service was a little slow at times. Saturday night might have something to do with it. Ironing the table cloths was a treat and sweet treats in the car from the valet wa special.
September 18, 2014|great meal but disappointed|4|"We had a wonderful meal here a year ago and returned to Providence hoping to repeat it. We did have a good meal and will try again next year but I left disappointed. For my entree I didn't see anything ""exciting"" on the menu and finally picked the rib eye thinking I might get a good one here. Most people would feel that I got a good one in that it was tender. But I date back to the days when a good steak had great flavor but the steak I got here was tender but tasteless. My appetizer was truly wonderful--the sweetbreads with a papadew gastrique. My wife had a very good appetizer of pork belly and roasted egg. She then had a second appetizer, the foie gras, which was also very good. The melon sorbet dish dessert was also very good."
September 13, 2014|Empressed|4|Fantastic food great atmosphere. Beers a little pricey. However I dont mind paying a little extra when the food and service are fantastic.
September 13, 2014|Consistency Plus|5|Gracies can always be depended upon for fantastic food, well-made drinks, attentive service and an overall great dining experience. We visit as often as we can and have never been disappointed in any way. Other restaurants should take a page from their playbook.
September 13, 2014|Nite out with visiting parents|5|This was my second visit to Gracie's and it was just as wonderful as the first time. Each course was delicious! The waitstaff is always so friendly. I wish I could remember our waitresses name but she was very patient with us and recommended perfect wine choices based on what we preferred. The service always runs smoothly and the staff always looks so well put together. I love how their shirts are not run of the mill starch white with a tie. The palate pleasers are perfect in between bites. The food is fresh and delicious! Love Gracie's! Worth it!
September 10, 2014|Can't Wait to Go Back!|5|Food was excellent. We had the 3 course menu, it was all fabulous. We will definitely return next time we are in Providence!
September 6, 2014|Anniversary Dinner|5|Wonderful place for a special occasion. Went to Gracie's for our 21st anniversary celebration. I had notified the restaurant through OpenTable about our special occasion. They had gone out of their way to reserve a special booth for the two of us with special decorations -- a very nice touch!! Food was great. We chose the 5-course meal. All pieces were specially prepared and well presented. The paired wines w/ each entree was good, however, if I had to do it again, I would have chosen a bottle of wine myself. All courses were outstanding. I wasn't crazy about the rabbit meat, but it gave me the opportunity to try something new.
September 6, 2014|Just perfect|5|What can I say more. Everything, really everything was perfect. Food, drinks and service are at an exceptional high level.
September 5, 2014|Amazing|5|It was my girlfriend's birthday and I wanted to take her somewhere I knew we would have a great meal. They went above and beyond with the care and little touches earning me some bonus points. Thanks again for a great meal and a memorable occasion, can't wait to come back!
September 5, 2014|Service Lacking|4|We have been to Gracie's twice. Both times we did the 5 course tasting menu with wine paring. Our first experience was fabulous; food was outstanding, service was great and knowledgeable. We had such a good time, we had wanted to go back for the past 9 months. Unfortunately this second time the service was terrible. The food and wine paring was again outstanding, but our server was not up to par. The whole meal for a 5 course pairing took just over 3 hours. In multiple cases we had a 30 minute wait between courses. After about two hours we began to realize that she had written us off. The server knew she was doing a terrible job and just gave up on even being around. I still recommend Gracie's and certainly go for the tasting menu.
September 5, 2014|The food was way above average for resta...|4|The food was way above average for restaurants of this ilk. The portions were not too small and not too big, a rarity. The amuse bouche and sherbert palate cleanser were unusual and fabulous. Service was assiduous and staff was knowledgeable.
September 3, 2014|Favorite restaurant in Providence|5|Gracie's is definitely my favorite restaurant in Providence. It's the go to place for special occasions, date nights, or any time you want great food at a relaxed pace. The menu changes frequently. While I haven't given up control yet and done the chef's tasting menu, it's a goal one day. Started with the gnocchi followed by the scallops with creme brulee for dessert. All were excellent. I've had almost every dessert they offer but keep going back to the creme brulee.
August 30, 2014|Night at Gracie's|5|Our Saturday night at Gracie's was absolutely perfect. The atmosphere feels like a modern speak-easy with a elegant bar and extensive drink list. The bartenders were terrific...knowledgable, engaging. The food was outstanding. Lots of locally grown vegetables and local fishes. Service was simply the best! Engaging staff. Incredibly knowledgable. The courses were served at a comfortable pace and we never felt rushed. Absolutely one of the best dining experiences we've ever had.
August 30, 2014|Go hungry!|5|Gracie's is a beautiful, romantic restaurant that knows how to incorporate flavors into wonderfully inspired classic dishes. My husband and I settled for the three course meal, and boy, was it delicious and enough. That being said, we had a drink and shared a small plate beforehand (at a different establishment), otherwise, perhaps the full course menu would have been an option for us. The service is excellent, the food a delight, and the atmosphere dim and cozy. I would highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner or special occasion...I (we) would come back here again when visiting Providence, but only after sampling a few more of what Providence has to offer!
August 28, 2014|Incredible dining experience|5|My wide and I went for our two year anniversary. This would be our second time at Gracie's. We had been years prior for a celebratory birthday dinner and enjoyed the best meal of our lives. For this trip we both chose the 7 course tasting menu and wine pairings. With my wife being pregnant, the waiter was quick to ask about specific foods that my wife couldn't have and had the chef alter his menu to accommodate. He did they same with the wines, offering my wife specifically crafted nick tails for each dish. The food was absolutely delicious to eat andbeautiful to look at. One of the greatest meals you'll ever have. The price is high, but the experience and food are worth it. You get exactly if not more than what you pay for.
August 28, 2014|Jaded New Yorkers no more|5|We had not expected the outstanding meal we were blessed with. Perfect pasta, dreamy sea food -- topped with great wine suggestions. A really outstanding meal.
August 28, 2014|Outstanding|5|I went to Gracie's for dinner with my parents and two sisters and the experience was amazing. The attentive, friendly service was perfectly matched to the impeccable food. Interesting, delicious ingredient combinations made each dish special, and everyone loved their meal - even my 10 year old sister. This was my second visit and it has firmly cemented Gracie's on my list of all-time favourites.
August 23, 2014|Amazing food and service. One of the bes...|5|Amazing food and service. One of the best dining experiences that my wife and I have ever had. Each staff member also went the extra distance to make it an extra special birthday dinner for my wife. We highly recommend the 7 course meal with wine pairing. Each course was more amazing than the previous one. Staff was very knowledgeable about the food and wine. Excellent establishment!
August 22, 2014|Amazing experience|5|It's with good reason that Gracie's is regarded as the best restaurant in Rhode Island. The food is always wonderful, and the staff goes out of their way to make you feel like an honored guest. We had a great time, and look forward to dining there again as soon as possible.
August 22, 2014|Gracie's makes occasions special|5|"Gracie's is our ""go to"" restaurant for special days."
August 21, 2014|Excellent cuisine, lovely ambience|4|We had the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairings. It was very, very good. The restaurant is large but the ambience is refined, cozy and intimate. The fish I had was excellent and I tried my son's duck which was out of this world. Bread was surprisingly so-so. Desserts were fantastic! I had the creme brulée. Wow! The only drawback to the otherwise perfect evening was our waiter, who seemed distracted and impatient. At a restaurant of this calibre you would expect the waitstaff to be of the highest standing; ours was not. Still, it could have been a bad night for him or maybe he's on his way out. In any case I would go back.
August 19, 2014|Delicious !|5|Everything about this place is wonderful and yummy!
August 16, 2014|Mixed This Time|3|Service oddly remiss early on, which server acknowledged, and we're not that fussy. But then another lapse or two. Did not expect this at all based on previous experience and on attention to nearby tables. Food was wonderful, as always. The place was quite busy with a reception, but that's no proper excuse for service lapses at a restaurant of this quality and reputation. Loved the meal but the experience as a whole was decidedly mixed this time, I'm afraid. Perhaps we should have told them it was an anniversary celebration....
August 16, 2014|Another superb meal at Gracie's!|5|We make a point of stopping in Providence, for the night on our way to Truro on the cape, specifically to be able to have dinner at Gracie's. It has become a beautiful tradition for us and this last time might have been the best of all. The food is superb with unusual and perfect combinations of taste and texture but it is never fussy. As my husband said, no foam was necessary to make a statement! We had the 3-course prix fixe with wine pairings. A beautiful tomato salad that I thought would be refreshing but nothing unusual, surprised me with the variety of heirloom and green tomatoes, herbs, a light sprinkle of goat cheese - just describing it does not do it justice. Everything including desserts - perfect!
August 14, 2014|Gracie's|5|Great fluke crudo sand duck. Great tea selection and awesome service..
August 9, 2014|Gracies|4|We had a fantastic evening, most notably for the extra effort the staff, especially our waiter, put in to acknowledge our 10th anniversary.
August 9, 2014|disappointing|1|We were seated at a table directly next to the bathroom and behind the bussing station. Our server complained that she had too many tables, and all of the main dishes were too salty. We gave feedback about the food to the wait staff in a respectable way but nobody seemed interested. Overall the experience was one of the worst that I have ever had at any restaurant in any city.
August 9, 2014|Bad Policies|3|While the food was excellent, we were not able to dine the way we had planned. Each of us wanted one of the tasting menus (3 and 5 course). They would not allow us to do this, therefore we had to put together one from the a la carte portion. I can understand the reluctance to have someone ordering a 5 course tasting and their partner ordering 1 small dish from the a la carte menu. Their view is these people are trying to share a tasting menu. However, 1 person ordering a 3 course tasting menu & another ordering a 5 course does not fall into the same thinking. In fact, both parties lost. We were not able to have the dinner we anticipated and they probably lost $100 in revenue based on what we finally ordered.
August 9, 2014|Gracies - Providence|5|Outstanding meal; exceptional presentation. Very friendly and personal service.
Dined on August 9, 2014|Five course menu tasting menu|4|We did the surprise five course with wine pairing. The food was excellent but the wine was disappointing. The pours were too small to accompany each dish, and the individual selections were not up to par with the food. The quality of the wines were mediocre and unfortunately diminished the overall experience.
August 7, 2014|Delicious|5|This was our second time at Gracie's, and we enjoyed it again. You will not be disappointed by this menu where the meals are prepared just a little different. It's a great place for a special occasion, celebration or just a great dinner out!
August 5, 2014|Impressed Again|5|A few weeks ago my friends treated me to a birthday dinner at Gracie's. The meal was incredible. From the friendly service to the artistic cuisine: Gracie's is among the top of it's class. I was sold when, upon arrival to our dressed up table, our server Kaitlyn, brought a complementary bottle of Presecco. I need not go any furthering explaining my obviously amazing expereince from that meal and the restaurant. I enjoy Gracie's so much I spent my last night in Rhode Island on Tuesday with a friend and indulged in their 5 course prix fixe menu, accompanied by a perfect wine pairing. Gracie's, you are my favorite restaurant. P.s. to anyone who reserves a table at Gracie's; request Kaitlyn, she's so friendly!
August 2, 2014|Fantastic Experience Overall|5|Had a wonderful dinner a Gracie's during a recent trip to Providence. The prix fix menu had a lot of variety and was extremely good value for the price. The service was spot on and could only be surpassed by the food. I had the duck for my entree and it was amazingly tender. The amuse Bouche and the palette cleanser between the first and second courses were both wonderful. One thing to note: reservations called into the restaurant take precedence over those made online. Not a big deal in my case. It was just me so they were able to accommodate me at a cozy high top in the bar. However, it could be an issue for a larger party.
August 2, 2014|August 3, 2014|5|We've never been treated so well for an anniversary dinner! When we first arrived, we were wished a Happy Anniversary and then taken to a private booth that seats only 2 people and does not completely open to the aisle, so we had a lot of privacy. Then we were treated to a champagne toast, a lovely quote from Audrey Hepburn, and star glitter on the table. Sweetbreads are one of our all time favorites, so we both ordered them and they were delicious. There were a number of different small items on the plate with different textures and flavors that complemented each other - the dish was wonderful. We found the same attention to texture and flavor with my scallops and my husband's pork. Great place for a special occasion!
August 2, 2014|Highly Recommended|5|The food and service were excellent. Waiters were knowledgeable about the food and wines.
August 1, 2014|  Excellent Meal and Service|5|Very consistent and great meal and service, highly recommend-
August 1, 2014|Fantastic meal|5|This was our second visit to Gracie's. The service was fantastic! The food was really good. Perhaps the best meal we have had all summer in a restaurant. We opted for the 3 course fixed price meal. The rigatoni was fantastic. I really enjoyed the gnocchi. The between course tastes were a nice touch and very delicious.
July 30, 2014|New favorite|5|"Last year when I was newer to town, I asked a friend for recommendations on where to go for my birthday dinner with my husband. She said ""Have you been to Gracie's? It's expensive but it's my favorite restaurant in Providence."" I looked it up and thought that it looked very formal. I was more in the mood for ""a scene"" and decided there were still so many places to try in Federal Hill. This year-straight to Gracie's. Loved it.We chose from the 3 course pre-fix. ($40 so really reasonable). I'm a vegetarian and my husband is a carnivour and we both loved everything. The blue cheese salad was balanced and tasty and the chef's presentation of seasonal Vegetables (vegetarian entrée) was beautiful and delicious. We loved the whole experience!"
July 30, 2014|Gracie's -- A missed treat|5|It has been over a year since I had been to Gracie's and I cannot imagine why I have not been back more often. A last minute reservation for a Wednesday evening probably was not necessary but made things convenient. My old friend and I ate at the bar rather than a table and were well taken care of by our very competent bartender/wait person. Both of has the Potato soup which was smokey, filled with perfectly cooked shell fish and tasted great. My 2nd course was local striped bass cooked to perfection. He had a giant pork chop with all the attachents that made it wonderful. Great food, well prepared, wonderful presentation. I will be back soon.
July 30, 2014|Gracie's is gracious!|5|Gracie's is a great dining experience. Great for a romantic dinner, or just to celebrate a special occasion. Service can't be beat. Food presentation is outstanding. Meal was delicious! Would recommend to anyone and look forward to returning.
July 26, 2014|Bartender|5|Amazingly skillful female bartenter (Laura)! Kept up with not only the patrons sitting at the bar (both food and drinks), but kept the entire restaurant going with drinks for all of the servers for tables as well! And our drinks were fantastic! Fast and accurate!
July 25, 2014|Great experience!|5|Came here for dinner. The food and service were both fantastic. Make sure you allot yourself at least two hours as things move slow... But in a good way. Each course was perfect.
July 25, 2014|Food always great, but not service|3|I always enjoy the great food at Gracie's but the main staff does not match. This recent visit, we even struggled just to just locate our server as we tried to order wine when our food was already coming out. The next time I saw him was for my check. Fortunately the bus staff worked very hard to make the evening pleasant, but there is still many small things that are missing to make Gracie's stand out, beyond the food. This common theme makes it hard to come back to.
July 25, 2014|Local gem !|5|We had a great time at Gracie's. Food was great, service prompt. Overall great experience.
July 25, 2014|Food was outstanding, service not|3|"As always the good was incredible. We had ordered the five course tasting menu and split the three course dessert tasting. Everything was going well until we got our fourth course. We then waited at least half an hour for our fifth course and our drinks and it never came. They started right in on the dessert tasting. We got two courses of the dessert tasting and then our ""fifth"" course. We never got our final course of the dessert tasting. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth especially since we were paying quite a bit for the meal."
July 25, 2014|Top 5 Restaurant meals ever|5|Amazing food & service. Really creative menu with lots of local produce, etc. Fantastic dining experience.
July 24, 2014|Good food, Pompous service.|1|Gracie's has always been our special place, most often enjoying the excellent food at the bar. Our dining room experience was very poor. We were a table of 5, celebrating a birthday. I stepped out to take a call, during which time the waiter refused to serve the ordered beverages to the rest of the party until my return. My wife finally convinced him to pour the wine, but he continued to ignore requests to bring the two cocktails. Once I returned, the cocktails arrived promptly. After that, in short, it took a total of three hours to order and be served a 3-course prix fixe, then 20 minutes of waiting after we finished dessert, after which the flustered manager finally brought our check. It is the bar for us, if we go back.
July 24, 2014|Good food bad table|3|This was our first time at Gracie's. We had a party of four for a business dinner with a client. I asked in the reservation for a nice quiet table away from traffic. We were sat at pribably the worst table in the restaurant, in a corner right next to the rest rooms and the wait station. The ambiance is very nice but we would not know since two of our seats faced directly into the wait station, which was both distracting and unsightly. I should have asked for a different table as the place was practically empty when we arrived. We did comment to the hostess when she sat us but she did not take the hint that we were unhappy with the table. That aside, the food was very good and our conversation was excellent, which made it OK.
July 24, 2014|Memorable dinner|5|"Chose the standard classics; not disappointed. Gnocchi were light and fluffy;ragout was rich and luscious. The duck was artfully prepared, & polenta was magnificent-so creamy. Lime anise sorbet (intermezzo)-inspired! Dennis provided perfect wine pairings. Service was excellent! The only sour note was when I arrived (on time; reservation booked months in advance, only 2 tables occupied when I came in) Hostess told me that since I had booked online, the restaurant policy was to seat me at the bar. (I wondered if this ""policy"" was stated because I was a woman dining alone. I told her that I expected a table, and she accommodated my request. Would love to try the tasting menu with my husband. Definitely worth a trip from Philadelphia!"

July 19, 2014|As good as it gets!|5|If you are planning a special night out, look no further then Gracie's. The ambiance and service is terrific. The food is top notch. Okay, so I am a dessert snob, and the desserts are a 7 out of 10. Otherwise you will love your experience. They make you feel very special!
July 19, 2014|Amazing every time|5|This was our second time visiting Gracie's and both times we went on peak days – first on Valentine's Day, then during Restaurant Week. No matter how busy Gracie's is, we always feel like the only guests in there. The waitresses and waiters work in seamless teams attending to your every need. If your water glass drops to halfway, they're right there to refill it. Our candle blew out and they re-lit it instantly. Then there's the food. To. Die. For. It's completely different every time. We did the five-course tasting and it's like a 100% custom menu just for you. Normally I hate bacon and I would never order crab off a menu but somehow if Gracie's makes it, I know I will like it. It's the perfect place to go to experience new things!
July 18, 2014|Everything was delicious|4|Fantastic, good was top notch and outlet waitress was attentive and sweet.
July 18, 2014|Best place in Providence|5|The food was better than any place I have been in Providence or Newport. They also give you little surprises that have wonderful flavor. They deserve the stars that they have received.
July 17, 2014|Awesome Food and Service|5|Very memorable experience. The food was fresh and expertly prepared. The combination of different foods and spices kicked up the meal several notches. My taste buds came alive. The service and attentive staff made one feel special
July 17, 2014|Better the first couple times|4|I've been to Gracie's 4/5 times. Each time I was impressed with the staff and food. This time we did the chefs tasting menu as before with 2 new guests. The restaurant this time was extremely load. The staff not as attentive and the food not up to what I've come to expect. We did the 7 course tasting menu. I was telling a freind about it today and could only remember 3 of the courses. That's how unremarkable the evening was. Our check came to $700 for 4 ppl with tip. For that much money I want to remember what I had.
July 17, 2014|A Star Studded Evening|5|From the attentive service to the delicious courses of food there was no room for improvement. The highlights were the delicious melon salad with a variety of melons and tomatoes in a light dressing. The bread is fabulous, offered in a basket brought to the table with 4 different varieties from focaccia to a baguette, a honey glazed bread and a raisin variation, all were superb. Our entrees were fresh local pan seared bass and the other was a rigatoni with delicious sausage flavored sauce. . The desserts are to die for- a crème brulee that was silky smooth and a plate with a toffee flavored ice cream, a meringue, some macerated berries all artistically plated. There was no skimping even with the Restaurant Week Menu.
July 16, 2014|Date night|4|Highly recommend for a romantic date night. Friendly waitstaff with high attention to detail and cognizant of special requests. Food is outstanding.
July 16, 2014|Feel special|5|Gracie's is our go - to special occasion spot. The food is beautifully presented and deliscious in every bite . The service is impeccable .
July 16, 2014|Another delicious meal at Gracie's!|5|We first went to Gracie's for my husband's birthday last year. That night we sprang for the 7 course tasting. Each plate was better than the last. This trip to Gracie's also lived up to our expectations. Beautiful presentation, attentive service, and amazing flavors. We will be back for our anniversary in September! Best meal in Providence.
July 15, 2014|Best restaurant in Providence|5|Consistently the best restaurant in Providence. My husband and I come here often for special occasions like anniversaries and birthdays. The service is excellent, the drinks are divine, but the food...the food is beyond delicious. Fresh ingredients, expertly prepared, beautiful presentation. It makes for a memorable evening every time!
July 15, 2014|Reliably good.|4|We've been to Gracie's three times so far, and each time we've been impressed with the variety and creativity of the dishes. The servers can be a bit obtrusive, but last night they were attentive without being cloyingly so. The restaurant week menu had something for everyone and was a good deal. The duck and the desserts were particularly good.
July 15, 2014|Hit every note!|5|What a pleasure! What a treat! From appetizer to coffee, the service was attentive and friendly, experienced but not stuffy. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Wonderful inventive combinations. Best duck ever! Crispy skin, delicious sauce! My new favorite in Providence.
July 12, 2014|HORRENDOUSlLY Arrogant Service|2|"As a matter of disclosure I should tell you we went here earlier in the week and it was the best experience at any restaurant weve ever had. The service from the time we hit the front door was unwelcoming. The waitstaff doted on the table next to us with three or four waitstaff over there ay a time while we waited for thirty minutes for our dessert. During this the ""waitress"" Sephanie actually walked by ourctable and flicked her hair at us three times. She literally threw complimentary homemade macaroons at us after the dessert when she delivered the bill. When we called the mamager once we got home to tell him, he offered a free meal to return. We turned it down. We prefer to remember our earlier experience there."
July 12, 2014|Restaurant week - nice courses|4|Gracie's is in every way a comfortable place - decor, staff, ambience, food. The food is fresh, very tasty and at times creative. Just two things: the cocktails on the menu are not like your normal cocktails - they are clearly inspired by food, so sweet and savory, onion and gin meet here. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, but they actually give you too much time to just sit and wait - for bread, food... I do blame myself a bit, coming from NYC, where they practically stuff the food down your throat and hope you leave after half an hour, so maybe I'm just too used to that.
July 12, 2014|wine pairing, tasting menu on point|5|Came here for restaurant week. Apparently they do the same 3 course tasting menu deal year-round for only $5 more and the portions are the same. The food was excellent, but what really amazed me was how well the wine tastings were done.
July 12, 2014|Outstanding!|5|Every time I visit Providence I have always wanted to eat at Gracie's, and I finally made it there this past weekend. All I can say is, WOW. My boyfriend and I opted for the restaurant week menu, and everything was absolutely phenomenal. From the service to the presentation of the food, to the extra little treats the wait staff brought us in between courses...everything was perfect. My boyfriend's duck literally melted in his mouth, and my pasta entree was wonderful. We definitely will visit Gracie's the next time we're in town, and will certainly try the Chef's tasting option that they offer.
July 12, 2014|We celebrated my birthday and it was won...|5|We celebrated my birthday and it was wonderful. I'm recommending it to all my friends
July 10, 2014|awesome|5|prefix menu is a great deal and absolutely delicious.
Dined on July 10, 2014|FANTASTIC!|5|Incredible meal from start to finish. A real treat. Service was outstanding. One of the best overall experiences Ive had at a reataurant in some time. Id go back to Providence and wouldnt think twice about going here again.
July 8, 2014|Great for Rest. Week and beyond|4|The restaurant is decorated in warm tones with golden colored tableclothes that make it appear lit in candle light. Wait staff is polite and very informed. The food is excellent and plated to look as good as it tastes. You feel relaxed and pampered. Large menu and the pre fixe offers a great deal. We went for a birthday and after asking if there was an occasion, they gave us all a glass of champagne, decorated the table with silver star confetti and made sure the person with the birthday got a dessert treat with a candle. No goofy singing, just a nice gesture. The palate cleansers and bites they offer between courses really make the experience special and all is delicious.
July 8, 2014|Went here for restuarant week. Excellent...|5|Went here for restuarant week. Excellent food and great portions. Also decided to spend a little extra to have a bottle of Gracie's wine, which you can't buy anywhere else. It was amazing and so worth it.
July 8, 2014|Great experience for the tastebuds|5|"My sister and I tried this restaurant during a special promotion. I had heard many wonderful things, and I was not disappointed. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It was definitely gourmet dining but unpretentious and not stuffy. The food was fresh and flavorful, unique flavor combinations but delicious. I had the sea bass as my main entree which had a great sear and was cooked to perfection! My sister tried the duck, crispy skin yet tender and juicy. We quite enjoyed the ""chef surprises"" between courses. The dessert was to-die-for. The creme brulee was yummy, but the real star of the evening was the peach semifreddo. A definite must-try for everyone. I will certainly be adding this restaurant to my rotation."
June 28, 2014|Oustanding Meal|5|This is one of the best restaurants I have dined at. The food is extremely well prepared and flavorful. The service is beyond excellent. It's a little pricey, but perfect for a special dinner.
June 28, 2014|To Gracie's with Love!|5|It was the first time my husband and I visited Providence. We celebrated our 5th Anniversary at Gracie's and it is Providence's gem! The best place in the whole city! We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing and it was an awesome experience. Even my husband, who is not gastrically adventurous, enjoyed the experience immensely. The service was wonderfull. They explained every dish and wine, which is very important when doing a chef's tasting. They also seemed very enthusiastic about their job and the food they were serving. Would highly recommend. Be sure to get a reservation as this is a highly desirable restaurant and all seats were taken.
June 27, 2014|Local gem|5|Fabulous experience. The staff is attentive and professional...
June 26, 2014|Delightful Dining Experience|5|We had a fantastic meal here! I had heard good reviews of Gracie's and it certainly lived up to its reputation. Thanks to our server's advice, we chose the 5 course chef's tasting menu. It was amazing! Every course was a wonderfully balanced and just the right size. I would recommend Gracie's for a special birthday, anniversary or other happy event. It is worth the trip to Providence!
June 25, 2014|Gracie's, June|5|The food was great, with lovely little amuse bouche between courses. Also, they had creative and fun alcohol-free cocktails and knowledgeable and friendly servers. It is in a very attractive downtown setting, with prix fixe, a la carte, and special tastings menus.
June 24, 2014|Outstanding, as usual.|5|Far and away one of the top restaurants in Providence, if not the best. We just kept smiling during our whole meal.
June 21, 2014|Everyone has an off night|4|I went to Gracie's for my 3rd time this past weekend, and while it was good--it was not great. The first 2 visits had been incredible, but this time the service was slow, the food was a little plain, and the portions were small. Not worth the price, but not quite ready to write them off yet.
June 21, 2014|Always supurb!|5|I took my friend for her birthday and as always Gracie makes it special. She had the maple cured salmon and I had the ramp tagliatelli for an appetizer. When we were finished we both looked at each other at the same time and said we were actually depressed that it was all gone! My arctic char was so perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of leek cream. The creme brulee was equally as yummy. Gracies is the best. Rachel and Jessie who waited on us were great. Can't wait to go back!
June 21, 2014|A new favorite!|5|We found Gracie's about a month ago on a whim and even though there were no tables available it was such a nice atmosphere we decided to eat at the bar. Delicious farm to table food, a friendly bartender who let us know that the Waterfire was on that night, attentive waitstaff, romantic ambience. This past weekend we tried it again and invited another couple to join us hoping it would be just as good. We were not disappointed. At the last minute I called to add a 5th person and it was no problem. I loved the dining room, the service was great and everyone raved about their dishes. We all went with the 3 course prefixe. Atlantic Char, beet salad, lemon meyer pudding cake dessert. Perfect portions and great cocktails!
June 21, 2014|Very Disappointing!|1|My wife and I have been coming to Gracie's for years and have always considered it our special place. Unfortunately, the whole night was very disappointing. We had to wait for fifteen minutes for the valet to return to his station when we arrived. There was a parade on the street so I understand it was difficult for him but the management should have anticipated the situation and had an extra valet on duty to address the issue. Our service throughout the evening was very slow. We ordered the five course pairing and waited at least thirty minutes between courses. The waitress brought our wine up to fifteen minutes before the food each time. Even the food was not up to their usual standard. I'm sorry to say we won't return.
June 21, 2014|Great special date night|5|We had a great time and really enjoyed the food and service. A prix fixe meal each was enough food for the two of us, and we loved each of our options.
June 21, 2014|Consistently excellent|5|Service is friendly & attentive. Lively flavor pairings and vibrant presentations make for a memorable dining experience.
June 20, 2014|Best bolognese pasta|5|On this visit to Gracie's everything was excellent. The service was attentive and professional. The food was just superb. I enjoyed my green salad, the bolognese pasta was to die for. YUMMY. The best I have every had. Seriously. It had a flavor I couldn't figure out and I think it was Anise. Loved it. The dessert (crembrule) was wonderful.
June 20, 2014|Exquisite food|4|Exquisite food is offered here, which you wouldn't find anywhere near. The service is very attentive, environment is comprehensive. When you visit that place, you wouldn't want to be any there else.
June 17, 2014|Food was excellent and service even bett...|5|Food was excellent and service even better-highly recommend.
June 17, 2014|Classy, elegant, imaginative|5|"Elegance meets New American--that's not the usual combination. We had the five-course tasting menu with the wine pairings, so this review does not apply directly to the printed menu. My preference in New American is for dishes that are unusual in the ""I never would have thought of that"" sense, without being weird for the sake of being weird. Gracie's succeeds brilliantly. The food contains unexpected combinations that work beautifully. The service was at the formal end of friendly, but still friendly, and very attentive. The ambience was quite refined and pleasant. All in all, an ambitious restaurant that succeeds in meeting its ambitions. Quite expensive for the menu we chose; otherwise a bit more moderate."
June 17, 2014|Memorable birthday|5|Excellent service and the food was superb! A truly memorable occasion with stars on my table! Our waiter Dennis was very skilled and answered all our questions. Scallops were the best I have ever had, my husband had the Arctic char and it was very moist, our daughter had the rigatoni with spicy sausage and fresh mozzarella. The three course fixed menu menu is recommended. Gracie's is wonderful and wish it was closer to where we live! Enjoy, and dine wonderfully well!
June 13, 2014|New Menu|4|Gracies is our favorite restaurant. The food, service, and ambience are always impeccable. Sorry to see the menu changed though. Maybe it's just this time of the year when local produce is not quite what it will be in the next few months. Seemed to be a bit more limited than usual.
June 12, 2014|A Night Out at Gracie's|2|The food was not memorable and the does not, in my opinion, deserve its high ratings. The portions were small and the main course overly salted. The wait staff on the other hand were very good and great for a business dinner.
June 11, 2014|Outstanding as always|5|I've been a Gracie's Groupie for years now, there's very little they've ever made that wasn't one of the best things I've ever had. Try their Creme Brulee if you've ever wondered what vanilla flavored silk would taste/feel like
June 11, 2014|Excellent restaurant|5|We loved the food, the place, the location, the atmosphere, the customer service. I loved the little delicatesses between meals and the little present in my car when I left! Also, I got a Thank you letter a few days letter hand written from the restaurant! That was what I call attention to detail and caring about cuatomers, even the ones that don't live in Providence like me :)
June 6, 2014|Exquisite|5|We celebrated a friend's birthday here and the experience was unforgettable. The entire staff conspired to make the evening magical. The wait staff and hostess were so relaxed and friendly--no uptight pretense here. The food was tops, absolutely tops, and the decor and ambiance just sublime. My husband and I are more than a little persnickety as diners, but everything here exceeded our expectations.
June 4, 2014|Delighted at every turn|5|On a recommendation chose Gracie's for a special Anniversay dinner. As soon as we arrived the staff made us feel special, from the warm greeting to the special table we were led to which was decorated with glitter. We chose the 5 course Chef's tasting with wine pairings and our dedicated two person waitstaff attended to all our needs. Each course was a delightful surprise and just scrumptious. It was a memorable experience and a real treat!!
June 3, 2014|Great Gracie's|5|This Providence gem just keeps getting better and better. Food, service, ambience are all top notch. Pricy but completely worth it.
May 31, 2014|A very enjoyable meal|5|We opted for the la a carte and 3 course fixed prix. The beet salad and foie gras were wonderful. The rigatoni dish has a nice spicy flavor and the scallops were excellent. Unfortunately, we found both the carrot cake and the chocolate cake to be a just a tad dry. We weren't expecting that. Other than that, it was a great dining experience and we will definitely try it again and maybe go for one of the tasting menus.
May 29, 2014|An unusual menu, and especially helpful ...|5|An unusual menu, and especially helpful and friendly staff.
May 29, 2014|Definitely work the $$$|5|we celebrated an anniversary here. the atmosphere was warm, lots of sunlight during day and viewing of the outside in the evening..- would have loved to b hearing soft music or piano in the background instead of the conversation right next to us. I found it a bit noisy not so Romance but still a great choice for the nights event.The window tables are much to close to one another-we can practically touch the next party! but aside from that; ALL the staff were exceptional-the attention was always on the customer! we like that! and no, we R not special. The wine selection was Superb! We choose a 5course meal w/our own wine and I must say I was most delighted as was my boyfriend.
May 28, 2014|29 May Review|5|We had the chef's five course tasting menu which changes daily and the diners do not know in advance what will be presented. All the food was excellent and beautifully presented. The wait staff was professional and very knowledgeable. We were celebrating our anniversary, and were given a special table as well as a complimentary glass of Cava when we arrived.
May 27, 2014|Perry|5|Everything was amazing, as always. Food, service, wine list were all the best we have had anywhere, at least since our last visit. With out a doubt the best and favorite spot for any occasion in the state.
May 27, 2014|Nicely done!|5|Our anniversary dinner was perfect from the moment we walked in the door. The service was attentive without being intrusive and all the little touches during the evening were wonderful. Food was perfectly prepared and presented beautifully. Best fine dining experience in Rhode Island.
May 22, 2014|Dinner at Gracie's|4|It was my first time. The place was great. The food was excellent, though a bit contrived. Service was very good except for the fact that multiple servers kept stepping on one another's toes. Three people offered us a choice of water. Two people brought us bread (at almost the same time). Nothing I can really complain about, but I noticed.
May 21, 2014|Fabulous again|5|We've had great meals every time we've been to Gracie's. The food competes with the service for the restaurant's best quality. Both are as good as any anywhere. The menu changes, but the experience never does. We love the place.
May 17, 2014|At Par But Below Expectations|3|Gracie's was good but not great. Appetizers were fine (warm asparagus soup was excellent), but main course skate needed more lemon juice and capers to spice up an otherwise bland presentation. Wife's duck was not quite crisped enough. Service was interesting as knowledgable bartender ended up as a part-time waiter as the evening wore on. Overall we enjoyed Gracie's but will probably not return.
May 17, 2014|Excellent!|5|One of the best in Providence. Every thing was perfect, our waitress (Lydia) was outstanding. We did the Chef's tasting. It wasn't just something to eat, it was art. I recommend it to everybody that isn't on a budget.
May 16, 2014|Foodie Paradise|5|"Gracie's has been on our must-try list for awhile, but we have been trying the ""new kids on the block"" and only just got there. Well, it was worth the wait and we will definitely be going back soon. This is definitely a special occasion or date night restaurant that has all the details right from impeccably prepared and presented food to attentive service to lovely decor. We had cocktails at the bar and got great recommendations from the bartender. For dinner, we chose the three-course prix fixe menu and added the fois gras. The first course of gnocchi with duck was a standout, but the whole meal was great."
May 16, 2014|Terrific restaurant|5|We have frequented Gracie's for years now and they never disappoint. This last visit was a special occasion for a family member. I was a bit disappointed that the hostess forgot to mention the occasion to our waitress and no mention of it was made. Next time, I would mention a special occasion when making the reservation!
Dined on May 16, 2014|GREAT!!!|5|Perfect place for a romantic dinner or a quick cocktail/meal after work. Definitely the best food in Providence. Make sure to make a reservation, as this place fills up fast. Prices reflect the quality of the food and the excellent service.
May 16, 2014|SteveH|5|Great place to go before the theater. Great food, great atmosphere
May 15, 2014|Gracies plus PPAC|5|We had 8:00PM tickets at the Providence Performing Arts Center and reservations at Gracies at 6:30. This was our first time there, as we are from Boston. We were seated immediately, but the waitstaff oddly bobbled our drink order and it took a long time to get started. However, after that the food was flawless and so was the service. The food is simply the best we have had in many years, both in NY and Boston, although we generally don't spend huge mounts of money. The waitstaff timed our departure perfectly and had us out the door at 7:45 without feeling at all rushed. We are dying to go back. Prices are very reasonable for the extraordinary quality. Dining as it should be.
May 15, 2014|Great as usual|5|We had diner before going to Trinity. Food was great as usual, and service is always very good. Will return
May 14, 2014|great for business dinner|4|I took my business clients from South Korea. Since they are used to smaller portion size the restaurant was perfect. Two ordered scallops, one arctic Char and another person skate. We all enjoyed our dishes. Servers brought all dishes at once which was amazing! I will go back there when I have another opportunity
May 14, 2014|6 Star Dining at 5 Star Restaurant|5|Last night was our first time dining at your restaurant and it was a gastronomical treat. The staff were wonderful and they made us feel at home from the time we arrived. The private table was a delightful surprise. Thank you for make our arrival and our 38th anniversary special. To expound: We chose to enjoy the seven course meal with wine pairing. The chef and staff treated us to a most delightful evening of dining. Each course was paired with a wine that was a perfect complement, bringing out the flavors. Even the cheese course paired with an Austrian Ale, to my wife's surprise, was delightful. After the dessert course, we were treated to two scrumptious cookies. Everything was above and beyond our expectations!!!
May 11, 2014|"
We ate the prix fixe dinner prior to go..."|5|We ate the prix fixe dinner prior to going to the theater. Service was outstanding; food likewise. Only small criticism was that one entrée could have been warmer. It's one of our favorite places in Providence.
May 10, 2014|Expectations exceeded|5|I asked for a little privacy since I was proposing to my girlfriend and got way more that I expected. My now fiancé and I were seated in the most romantic booth I've ever seen in my life. It's the only one like it in the whole place as far as I can tell. The food was delicious and the service couldn't have been better. I will recommend this place to all my friends.
May 10, 2014|Yummy as Usual|4|We celebrated a 2-birthday dinner this weekend and while the food was top notch as expected, the overall experience seemed a little off. Service was slow, we had to ask for water and bread, and 3 entrees were served but the fourth had a much longer than expected wait. Portions also (esp of apps) seemed a little smaller. The quality of the food and the little extras (toast to start, two tastings between courses, and cookies in our car) certainly made up for it but overall the evening was not up to our past visits. Skate, duck, and beet salads were all extraordinary!
May 10, 2014|Great place|4|1st time there..we pulled up and the valet was outstanding, We were 20mins early and had a drink at the bar..excellent service. We were seated promptly on time and decided to do the 7 course meal with the wine pairing. Started with scallop tatar..then an interesting soup and salad.. a to die for lobster dish, a duck (excellent). a cheese platter (ok) and a hazelnut mouse(good.) The wine pairing ranged from sparkling wine, a chard, pinot noir, a port, a cab and glass of beer. All very small tastings 2oz. I was concerned with the small portions I would still be hungry but was actually very full. I think it us because they draw it out over 2 1/2 hrs. Next time I would just do al a carte and a nice bottle of wine. Very good experience but long
May 10, 2014|Amazing tasting dinner|5|"We went there for an early Mother's Day dinner and did the 7 course tasting. Everything was amazing and Gracie's went out of their way to accommodate our special needs (food allergies and pregnancy). While my husband had the wine pairings, I had a different and special ""mocktail"" with each course. I was just amazed at the mocktails and felt special that the bartender went out of her way to make me such unique drinks. We have always enjoyed the food at Gracie's, but this was the first time we have done the tasting dinner and it was amazing!"
May 10, 2014|Perfect dinner|5|Had the 7 course chef's tasting. Amazing from start to finish. I've never had a price of duck so perfectly cooked in my life. Absolutely delicious. The team of servers were amazing, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Gracie's is my favorite restaurant in providence.
May 10, 2014|Wonderful experience|5|Truly an unforgettable dining experience. Planning a return trip to set aside time for a 5 course tasting!
May 9, 2014|Always top notch - except desserts!|4|Gracie's is one of my most favorite restaurants any where in the world. They have the best main courses, exceptional service, and remember my likes/dislikes when I'm taking a tour de menu. Over the years, however, the desserts are not fabulous. It concludes with disappointment. Why not try simple mini cream puffs, mille feuille, or eclairs. Varied pot de crème, crepes? Instead we get good-looking concocted sweets that fall flat.....
May 9, 2014|Great but slow, showtime don't go|4|First impression was that the ambience was amazing. It was great they asked questions about our time limit, but it seemed unnecessarily long that a 3 course dinner would take 2.5 hours to properly enjoy. The restaurant began getting very busy but the tables that had already been seated seemed to be forgotten, with the exception of additional bread. If our 3rd course would have arrived sooner, our dessert and bottle of wine wouldn't have had to have been rushed. Overall, if you have time constraints, do not go to Gracie's. If you are looking for good food, attentive but slow service, an attractive wine selection, with bread that seems to be endless, Gracie's would be the place to go!

May 8, 2014|Excellent dinner experience.  Not much t...|5|Excellent dinner experience. Not much to say but you require additional comments.
May 7, 2014|Excellent restaurant!|4|Four of us ate an early midweek dinner at Graciesafter a matinee at the theatre across the street. The service, food and overall experience was very very good. We opted for the 3 course prix fixe menu for 40. Which is a reasonably fair deal. A la carte is quite expensive but I woukd definitely return and order the prix fixe again. Waiters were professional and knowledgable and we really appreciated that!

May 3, 2014|A click off top gear|4|Food was excellent. Table service was good although the support for the serving team was lacking. Overall, the experience was good and we will dine there again
May 2, 2014|Great place to celebrate!|5|I left one little note, when I made our (late reservation) on line, and we were treated like VIP's! The service and food were fantastic!
May 1, 2014|Best food/service in Providence|5|I cannot get enough of Gracies in Providence! The food and service will rival any other fine dining restaurant in the Providence area, if not out due their competition in my opinion. Even if the A La carte selection might be too much for some people, there is a wonderful $40 preset 3 course meals available. The whole staff is very attentive and super friendly, you could drop your fork and no matter who is around a staff member will come right over to bring you a new one. I am not very skilled in writing restaurant reviews but if your reading this please take my advice and go make reservations right away!
April 30, 2014|Perfect Dinner Celebration|5|This is a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. The food, wait staff and atmosphere were excellent. We will defintitely visit Gracie's again.
April 26, 2014|Food with a price|4|Excellent food but cramped seating took away from the overall experience.
April 26, 2014|Try everything|5|I'm a novice at Nouvelle cuisine , but I've learned to just try anything that is put in front of me and at Gracie's it's always a pleasant surprise. The beet crisp calamari appetizer was fab(I don't do beets either)
April 25, 2014|Worth Every Penny|5|Excellent overall experience... Not a cheap night out but worth it.
April 25, 2014|Great food, average service|3|All of our food was delicious, but the service was a bit spotty. One member of our party never received a menu and we had to wait for quite a while for the server to take our credit cards for payment. Otherwise, service during the meal was good.
April 25, 2014|Great food, lots of fun|5|This was our first visit and we weren't brave enough to try the 5 course tasting. We ordered off the menu (first and second courses as we are not big dessert people). The food was phenomenal. My husband had the rutabaga soup and a chicken dish. I had the beet salad and the artic char. 2 amuse-bouches were presented which was fun, and my husband was presented with a spirit to try and a riddle to solve. Our only complaint was that the tables for 2 were much too close together and there was very little privacy. However we were lucky in that the couple to our right was very friendly and we shared some conversation. Overall, the food was excellent, the service was wonderful, it was a fun experience and we will definitely return.
April 22, 2014|Pre-theater delight!|5|When attending Trinity, we are in the habit of making an evening of the event and enjoying a pre-theater dinner. Gracies' careful attention to detail, interesting menu, and notable extras - between courses sherbert, cookies in the car, etc. Always an enjoyable interlude.
April 19, 2014|Absolutely superb!|5|This is a restaurant which makes one want to return to Providence. The food is excellent - creative, beautifully presented and delicious. It ranks with the best food we've ever eaten - and we travel & dine out often! The service is professional. The setting is sophisticated. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
April 19, 2014|In town for 1 Night? Go here!|5|We visited Providence for the weekend and had only one evening to eat out. There are 100s of places recommended in providence but this is the one to make it to. We also had tickets to a play across the street. I mention that simply because our waiter asked is we had a time frame for our meal and he would plan our meal accordingly. What a treat. Not rushed to turn the table and out on time. The food was delicious. We opted for the 3 course meal and made our choices. Great wine selection with some locally bottled choices. The duck was moist and delicious. Our waiter, Coleman, was very well informed and didn't miss a beat when it came to service and attentiveness. Gracie's will be on our list every time we are in Providence.
April 17, 2014|Pre-theatre gem!|5|If you're looking to go of dinner before a show a Trinity Rep, this is the place. Complementary parking for dinner and the show, too! We had a lovely time at dinner!
April 12, 2014|Lovely Experience in Providence|5|We came to Gracie's because we were visiting our daughter who is a culinary student at JWU. We like to take her to Providence restaurants to see what the local chefs are up to! Gracie's did not disappoint! The service was impeccable and every bite of food sublime! We all decided we would come back for the tasting menu and wine pairing when she is 21! Bravo!
April 12, 2014|LOVE LOVE LOVE|5|Easily my new favorite restaurant. We had the 5 course tasting menu and it was absolutely fantastic. I love everything about this place. Just perfect. Thank you so much and we will be back for certain.
April 9, 2014|The best restaurant in Providence|5|I truly loved every aspect of the restaurant. From atmosphere, to service, to food....superb. I cannot wait to go back and recommend this place to anyone that loves fine dining!
April 8, 2014|Inventive food combinations|5|Try the tasting menu, the Chef presents dishes which are not on the menu! Sooo delicious! Service sometimes a bit unorganized but very friendly.
April 5, 2014|From the Bar to the Table..Amazed!|5|It's been a long time since I've seen a bartender CARE about his craft. The attention to detail that Keith took in every drink he crafted was fun to watch and delicious to drink. The mixers & additions to normally mundane bar drink menu's made me want to skip dinner and have Keith keep feeding me new concoctions each time. We didn't have a seat at the bar yet Keith hopped out from behind the bar to help, seeing there was no easy spot to order a drink without hovering over another guest. He handed us the drink menu, explained the special drink & took our order without skipping a step. Dinner proved just as fantastic. We did the 5 course tasting sub'ing a Fois Gras for the desert. Each tasting was exciting to look at, and better to taste.
April 4, 2014|Good prix fixe menu|5|Our first visit to Gracie's. We were welcomed and seated graciously and promptly. The bar mixed nice cocktails. The prix fixe menu we chose had limited choices, but they covered a nice range: my wife had a very nice beet salad and exquisite duck breast; I had very good gnocchi with duck confit and then a fine rigatoni with spicy sausage, tomatoes, and ricotta. My crème brûlée was tasty, as was her bread pudding. The wine list has a nice range and has a few interesting half bottles, for those who like a cocktail but don't want to overdo it. I'll be back the next time I'm in Providence. Noise was a bit high when we arrived (8:15 pm) but things quieted down by the time the main course arrived.
April 3, 2014|anniversary evening|5|I used OpenTable to reserve and received a pre-night call to confirm, mentioning an anniversary with request for a romantic table. We arrived to a candle lit, glitter strewn, poem facing table, all to our unexpected delight. The ambiance was wonderful, particularly the cosmic star and comet theme. We decided on the five course prix fixe menu and were absolutely blown away with the food, the wine and the knowledge and professionalism of the staff. This was truly a night to remember for our first anniversary. We had a fabulous time. Everything done so well, even down to the cookies in the dashboard from the valet! We howled! We were curious about Gracie's and now we know to definitely come back. And also to tell everyone we know!
April 1, 2014|Went to Gracie's for a business|5|Went to Gracie's for a business dinner, my husband had done some research to make sure we found something close by for my colleagues who were at a client site around the corner, the reviews were all excellent which made our decision easy. I had requested that they put us in a corner table as their were 7 of us and that it was also the bday of a colleague. We arrived and found that they set up a gorgeous table in the corner for us and also set the table with special details for my co workers birthday. The special touches also went noticed, the champagne offered for a birthday toast to the candle on the cake as well as the waiter coming over almost on que filling our wine glasses. I love Gracie's and am already planning a girls night out.
Dined on March 29, 2014|Special Occasion|5|Don't judge a book by it's cover. Not much to look at from the outside but the food is outstanding. The menu offers a la carte or pre fixe we went with the three course pre fixe. We both had a beet salad that had an assortment of heirloom beets and fresh ricotta cheese followed by swordfish with an olive tapenade and finally a lemon bread pudding with the creamiest ice cream. Every dish was artistically presented with layer upon layer of delicious flavors. A special treat was the coffee served in individual French press pots. The service was impeccable as all the wait staff was so pleasant and attentive. I highly recommend Gracie's to anyone looking for that culinary experience.
March 29, 2014|A unique experience...|5|If you love to be surprised...then go to Gracie's and order the Chef's tasting...there are two options: 5 or 7 course with or without wine. For those that want to know exactly what they are eating or the whole table doesn't want to participate, there is a Prix-fixe menu of 3 courses or you can order ala carte. The Chef's menu was fabulous! They first asked if you had any food dislikes or allergies! What presentations...each course brought by a different server and explained fully. The portions sizes were very generous. We had a salad of baby carrots, two or three kinds of crispy mushrooms. Followed by a beet cannoli; poached cod, a huge lamp chop and two desserts. Great service! There's more but go experience it!
March 28, 2014|My fav in Providence|5|You cant beat the food quality and service. Amazing experience and service and its my go to place for special occasions. I highly recommend this place and you wont be disappointed. I usually go for the prefix menu, the choices are high quality proteins, which makes a great value compared to similar venues.
March 28, 2014|Just had an overnight in the|5|Just had an overnight in the area. Don't live far and can't wait to go back. Wish I lived in the city so I could partake in their events. Had a great experience and want to get a group to go back and enjoy their private rooms.
March 25, 2014|Exceptional food & service|5|Went there after a show downtown...had reservations for 9:45 and the kitchen closed @ 10pm. We got there a few minutes late (called to let them know) and they took us in without hesitation. Food was prepared hot, fresh, and amazingly delicious, as if it were 6pm. Yes, it's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. You will not be disappointed. If you are, there's something wrong with you. We'll definitely be back.
March 22, 2014|Great food/inexcusable service|3|30 minutes between dinner being cleared and dessert...then waiting 45 minutes for our credit cards to be returned ....without an apology...inexcusable. We were seated at 8 and left at 12:30.
March 22, 2014|Exceptional Food|5|We found the food to be top notch. We were extremely impressed with the variety of food as we chose the 5 course meal with wine pairing. We really liked how we did not have to think and enjoyed all 5 courses. We went outside of our comfort zone and enjoyed foods that we would never have ordered. Can't wait to go back!!
March 22, 2014|The best!|5|Went with my boyfriend and my parents for their 35 th anniversary---the staff made the evening very memorable and the food was out of this world. Do not miss this place!
March 21, 2014|Impressed|5|The food and service were impressive. Can't wait to go back.
March 19, 2014|Another great trip to Gracie's|5|Gracie's is a great restaurant. I enjoy it every time I visit.
March 18, 2014|A Graceful Gourmet Experience|5|Gracie's remains true to its mission of service and wonderful food. It never disappoints with attention to service, creative food, and an ambiance that makes one feel you are the only one in the restaurant when all around are others who are either celebrating a special moment or going to the theater across the street. The choices of entrees meet everyone's palate and the desserts are elegant and delightful. This is one of Providence's finest restaurants, in my opinion.
March 15, 2014|A tad rigid in their policies|3|We took my daughter to celebrate her birthday. She's a real foodie and was looking forward to the chef tasting menu. Alas it was not to be because in order to partake in the tasting menu the entire party had to participate. There were five of us and only two were planning on trying it out. My husband has a very limited palette and it would have been a waste of money for him to join in. All in all food was delicious. We ordered a la carte because and enjoyed our meals. Just disappointed that they don't make an exception on this. Found it to be very off putting and because of that probably won't return.
March 13, 2014|Dined with my daughter and|5|Dined with my daughter and we had the 3 course prix fixe dinner before a play. Everthing was delicious and well presented: roast beet salad, duck breast, bread pudding for me; gnocchi, swordfish, creme brulee for her. Valet parking was a treat. We came out of the theater across the street on a cold night and the valets had cars lined up on the curb. And 2 tiny cookies in a Gracie's bag on the console. Nice touch!
March 12, 2014|Dinner at Gracie's|3|As members of the same industry, we were looking forward to dining here as we had heard a lot; whilst the food was good (we especially enjoyed the desserts) the service was erratic, our main course entree was wrong & our waitress never even apologized, we ended up waiting 10minutes for bread and throughout our meal was actually served by 4 different people! It was not even a busy night.
March 12, 2014|Amazing experience..food was|5|Amazing experience..food was fabulous and so was the service. We loved our table.
March 11, 2014|A Special Treat|5|Gracie's is one of my favorite dining experiences. The food preparation and superb taste makes your dining experience a memorable occasion. The menu choices are excellent. The staff makes you feel like family but gives you space to enjoy your time alone. The staff also follows up to make sure you understand every option and are not waiting for the next step. For couples, the atmosphere is very romantic. If you are dining for business purposes, the atmosphere is quiet and your space is not crowded. Gracie's is a gem like Rhode Island is. You should cherish the experience
March 8, 2014|Beyond delicious!|4|The food at Gracie's was incredible! I was amazed at how brilliantly they mixed together flavors and textures. However, we had a 7:15 reservation and weren't seated until about 7:40. Other than that I have absolutely no complaints about the food, ambiance, and service at Gracie's.
March 8, 2014|Gracie's, as always|5|We enjoyed another wonderful dining experience at Gracie's. Everything lived up to expectations in terms of the food and the service. The only issue we noticed was we no longer have the opportunity to upgrade prix fixe offerings, which resulted in my wife being forced to order her entire meal a la carte, at a higher overall upcharge. The old system gave you the option of just paying a simple one-course upgrade charge, which we preferred. But, it's OK, because Gracie's still provides good value for great food and a very civilized evening.
March 7, 2014|anniversary meal|4|The food and service was excellent and it was very nice that they prepared the table for our anniversary celibration. Everything was just right except for the noise level which was too high. It was difficut to have a conversation in the resturant without feeling like you were yellint to each other. Even with the noise level, we recommend Gracies to many of our friends.
March 4, 2014|We did the 5 course tasting|5|We did the 5 course tasting menu. All of the food was delicious. Well worth the price! Impeccable service.
February 28, 2014|Amazing ... a small piece of heaven|5|This place has amazing ambiance ... if you want to impress a date, take him or her here. The staff is friendly and an entire team services you throughout your visit. I would also strongly recommend doing the chef's tasting menu, which is in part based on your interest/preferences as well as what is fresh on the market. ... Was there about a month ago and did the 5-course tasting with wine pairing. Of course I liked some dishes more than others (and perhaps the last wine pairing was bit of a miss for me) it was overall heavenly. Also, in the summer, the chef grows his own herbs on the roof. Doesn't get any more local than that.
February 28, 2014|Another great meal!|4|We have returned several times to Gracie's, considering it our go to place for special occasions. We always order the 5 or 7 course tasting menus with wine pairings and have never been disappointed. This time around was no different, although the service seemed choppy at the outset. We had 7:00 pm reservations, arriving on time. We were sat and while the restaurant was busy, it was not manic. It seemed like we had waited forever before anyone came to take an aperitif order and then an even longer wait for said libations to arrive. Not good on a Friday evening after a long week. One of our dinner mates has incredible food allergies and I can happily say that the kitchen went above and beyond to make her visit memorable, in a good way.
February 28, 2014|Love this place|5|The food is an adventure I wish I could take everyday. The service is top notch. And the ambiance is everything you want in a romantic or intimate dinner.
February 27, 2014|Great job all around|5|The menu choices, the food and the service were just stellar. We keep coming back and will continue to do so. They even left cookies in our car after we got it back from Valet :-)
February 26, 2014|Amazing experience|5|My husband and I had the 5-course and it was simply perfect. The staff was Knowledgeable and the bartender made some amazing cocktails
February 26, 2014|This was our 2nd time at Gracie's|5|This was our 2nd time at Gracie's and we had an amazing time again. My fiance and I chose the prix fixe menu and were delighted with our food, this is very quickly becoming one of our favorite restaurants and it never disappoints.
February 26, 2014|It doesn't get any better|5|It doesn't get any better than this! Short rib recently added to the menu is outstanding. All the favorites are still there as well.
February 22, 2014|Awesome Night!!|5|From the minute we entered this restaurant till we drove away (with treats left in our car) we were in awe. Tha ambience and service was impeccable. The food was superb. I had the duck which was mouth watering. The desserts were excellent. Our server I believe was Lydia was so pleasant and friendly. She especially made our night. We will be back for more good times!!
February 22, 2014|Better Than Expected|4|This was my third visit and my expectations weren't great. We went with another couple because it was convenient to the theater across the street. They begin by asking if you've ever been there before (are you sophistocated enough to dine with us?). But the waitress was very accommodating about needing to be out in time for the threater and really very pleasant. We all ordered from the three-course prix fixe menu which had a choice of only three entrees, all of which were pretty standard faire. The salad and desert were great. My wife and I felt the swordfish was a little overdone. I also felt the elaborate setting and resetting of silverware was not to my taste. Enjoyed a good bottle of Savignon Blanc from NZ at $45.
February 21, 2014|The food, service, and attention|5|The food, service, and attention to details are always exceptional at Gracie's!
February 18, 2014|Anniversary spectacular|5|Wife and I celebrated our anniversary. Booked a reservation at Gracies. Best meal I've eaten since I can remember… What a great place!
February 15, 2014|Gracie's is a GEM!|5|We dined at Gracie's for a Valentine dinner and it was just amazing! We went with the 7-course tasting menu and I paired mine with a wine tasting! I cannot say enough about the quality of the food, the wait staff, the customer service, the special treats, the wine, and did I say the Food! It was a tasting menu so the dishes were small but perfect....the flavors and ingredients were abundant and by the end of the meal, we were more than satisfied! It was simply wonderful! We would definitely go again! This restaurant knows how it's done. Special treats throughout the meal and treats in your pocket and car when the valet brings it around. Can't say enough about this wonderful place.
February 14, 2014|Great place to dine!|4|We were there for Valentine's Day. Our meal was great and the service matched! Well thought out menu!! Only suggestion make your dessert larger. Food was relish!!! I recommend this restaurant to food lovers!!!
February 14, 2014|Valentine's day dinner - I|4|Valentine's day dinner - I had the gnocchi and the sea bass, my wife a salad, the swordfish, and the marscapone dessert. Everything was excellent. Service was good if a little hectic - amuse bouche came just after the starter was put down, etc. But this is a quality place.
February 14, 2014|Gracie's|5|A true dinning experience. The food is increadable!!!!!
February 13, 2014|Tasting menu|5|I enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu without wine pairing. I felt the portions were adequate and the experience was our of this world. Hats off to the chef. Would do it again.
February 13, 2014|Valentines day|5|Awesome experience. Staff very knowledgable and friendly. Great place for romantic dinner. I highly recommend Gracie's.
February 12, 2014|Happy anniversary|5|The food and atmosphere is wonderful. However we have never experienced the customer service we received. We were going to the theatre and ran out of time for dessert. Our server sent us to the show without having to pay our bill knowing we were coming back for our third course. Never have experienced this and for sure guaranteed our coming back again and again.
February 8, 2014|When we got to Gracie's the|4|When we got to Gracie's the valet told me the lot was full so i had to use a parking garage. When i got in the restaurant i told the host and they offered to pay my parking fee. i was very surprised and pleased. Great service!
February 8, 2014|Food is outstanding but the|4|Food is outstanding but the portions are fairly small, especially given the price.
Dined on February 7, 2014|Gracie Gracie Bo Bacie's!!!!|5|Trying the tasting menu, it was an experience. Down to earth and friendly staff, valet leaves a cookie in your car too!
February 7, 2014|Romantic dinner for two|5|The food is beautifully crafted and the craft cocktails and draft beer selection are interesting and artful. We enjoyed the romantic ambiance for our five course tasting, the gnocchi with duck confit was a real standout.
February 7, 2014|Never disappointing|5|Nowhere else would I dare to do the chefs tasting. I always end up trying something new and loving it! Gracie's is always my go to spot for special occasions!
February 6, 2014|Outstanding wine-pairing experience|4|The 7-course wine pairing dinner we experienced was fantastic. Complex flavor combinations complimented perfectly with unexpected wine selections - like an outstanding white made in Stonington, CT of all places. Didn't even know wine was made in coastal CT! Only criticism is it took almost 5 hours from start to finish. We weren't in a hurry and fully enjoyed our experience but be sure to allow enough time if you're planning on enjoying the Chef's selection wine-pairing dinner!
January 31, 2014|Worth the Wait|5|I have wanted to dine at Gracie's for some time and finally made it for my birthday. My husband and I were seated at a secluded table that had been decorated with stars for the celebration. Several staff members wished me a happy birthday and we were offered a complimentary glass of sparkling wine which was a very nice touch. We had the 5 course wine pairing dinner and were blown away by each course, the next matching and even exceeding its excellent predecessor. From octopus carpaccio (tender and delicious) to goat cheese pasta with lamb (should be offered as a main) to fish and on to pork it was all fabulous. Gracie's has made it into our top 5 ever. Can't wait to try all their seasonal menus.
January 31, 2014|A wonderful evening!|5|"My husband and I selected Gracie's for a ""Date Night"" and it was an outstanding evening! We started at the bar with featured cocktails which were excellent and prepared by a very friendly bar tender. Then we both had the Five Course Tasting with the paired wines. Dinner was delectable, paced perfectly, wines interesting and new to me and served with just enough information. And it was fun! We will definitly return!"
January 30, 2014|Gracie's is great!|5|This is a very special but expensive restaurant, just right for special occasions. The meal starts with an amuse bouche and a sorbet is served as a palate cleanser (have you had ginger curry sorbet?). Wine list is extensive but at $15/glass, pretty expensive. The price fixed menu (3 courses) has good choices and is cheaper at $40 than an ala carte choice and dessert. The food was delicious as always. The waitstaff was very knowledgable. The gnocchi, swordfish and coconut/pineapple bread pudding were the best ever. An introductory glass of sparkling Spanish wine, cookies with the bill and chocolate chip cookies in your valet parked car make this a really nice evening out.
January 25, 2014|My favorite Providence restaurant|5|Service and food are impeccable. Just a great experience from the moment you pull up to the valet to the time you drive away (and find warm cookies in your car for the ride home!!).
January 25, 2014|Delish|4|The gnocchi was the best thing I've ever had! The beet salad was also very good. I will be going back to try the tasting menu.
January 25, 2014|One of New England's Best: Gracies|5|The food, service and attention to detail have stayed top notch at one of our favorite New England restaurant's, Gracie's. While the winter menu may not be as exotic or interesting as the Spring/summer offerings, the quality and tastes were spot on. Looking for a special place, this is it. It will not disappoint!
January 24, 2014|What a gem!|5|Best dining experience we had in a long time. The service was outstanding, from the knowledgeable and helpful staff, to the valet, who leaves a treat in the car for you! The food was incredible, and you can tell the chefs take pride in what they do.
January 23, 2014|Gracie's is fabulous|5|This was our second time at Gracie's. Not only is the food cooked by foodies, it's served by them too. We had swordfish and a huge portion of lamb (local) shoulder (both of which were seasoned and cooked to perfection) after a very good pork terrine and the best gnocchi we've ever tasted. And that was after two really interesting and tasty gin-based cocktails. In between there were various amuse bouches. The chocolate-banana cake was a delicious finish to a ten-on-a-scale-of-ten meal. But maybe the greatest extra was the service. Our waitress clearly loves and knows food and drink and everything about their preparation. She takes obvious joy in sharing her knowledge with her customers. I don't see how Gracie's could be improved.
January 22, 2014|Always Love This Place!|5|Gracie's is one of the best restaurants in Providence. I love all the special touches they put into making your meal here memorable. If you have never been to this restaurant you must go!
January 21, 2014|A Culinary Treat|5|This was one of my most excellent culinary experiences; a meal that rates among my most delicious, uniquely enjoyable and pleasant dining experiences in over 5 decades of international and national travel. I left it to the chef to create a dining experience for my wife and I with wine tastings to match and it was fantastic.
January 18, 2014|Fantastic service|5|The service at Gracie's is unparalleled - servers are informed, efficient, pleasant and very smooth. The drinks are also unique and delicious and the food is so beautiful you don't want to eat it. Really lovely experience from start to finish.
January 17, 2014|outstanding|5|Dinner was wonderful and beautifully presented.The bread choices were delicious and plentiful and fun.The waitstaff was attentive and professional and friendly.I am looking forward to many retitn trips.
January 15, 2014|Delicious food, Amazing service|5|Heard many great things about this place, especially the food, and wanted to take advantage of the restaurant week menu. I had such a great experience eating here. The ambience was great and the food was delicious! However, what puts this place over the top of any restaurant I've ever been to is their amazingly friendly and courteous service. I will definitely be coming back frequently. Great service goes a long way and they've definitely won me over. Kudos to the chefs!
January 15, 2014|spectacular|5|Everything is amazing the service and the food are most notable
January 15, 2014|Everything was amazing!|5|A group of us went for restaurant week and all of us left very full and satisfied. The duck was the entree winner for the night. It was by far the best duck breast I have ever had.
January 14, 2014|Excellent meal|5|"Decided to try Gracie's for restaurant week. VERY happy we did! Loved all the little ""extra's"" in between courses and the cookies left in the car by valet (great idea!). Service was great and the food was exceptional! Will definitely be heading back outside of restaurant week."
January 14, 2014|#1 restaurant in Providence|5|fantastic, friendly and personal service. food always outstanding. timing of courses just right.
January 11, 2014|Great, not incredible|4|My boyfriend and I live in New York and have very high expectations, so it's hard to impress us. It's a great restaurant with a fresh, seasonal menu. Our server was very nice but a bit unprofessional. However, she asked about allergies and was there when needed. Also, there was a TV on at the bar which slightly ruined the romantic ambiance. We had the pork and pistachio terrine, slow cooked hen egg, and I had the porkchop and my boyfriend had the NY Strip. My porkchop was delicious but a bit heavy; I would have liked some more acidity or lightness. Boyfriend's steak was buttery and melt in your mouth but one too many things happening on the plate. All in all, lovely night out, great cocktails, but not the best meal I've ever had.
January 11, 2014|Amazing. Outstanding. Incredible|5|I am and will always be a loss for words when it comes to this restaurant. I love it and will always love it. They know exactly how things should be done and their food is to die for. The meal in itself was amazing and I have been raving about it and my experience with everyone that I come into contact with.
January 11, 2014|Phenomenal|5|Everything was superb! I hadn't been to Gracie's for a few years. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised and will bece loyal patrons!
January 10, 2014|First visit|3|Food was truly 5 star but service was not. Waited 20 minutes for drinks at bar. Only a few guests at bar. There were two bartenders, one was on service. Not very friendly. Dinner service was good till end of meal. Had to ask for coffee with dessert and had to ask for dinner drink that never came. Seemed server had moved on to new tables and was done with us. I would try again, but must admit I expected better.
January 10, 2014|Gracie's is the best|4|If you haven't already heard great things about Gracie's, then you're about to learn all about how amazing they are. The food alone makes it absolutely worthwhile but when you add amazing service, a wonderful ambience and a great drinks menu, you know you've hit the jackpot. It's definitely not a place to miss. I also want to add that being vegetarian, eating out can sometimes be a little restricted but the chefs here make sure you have a decent number of options which was my pretty awesome!
January 10, 2014|As usual, the experience @|5|As usual, the experience @ Gracie's is top notch, from the non-traditional cocktail list, to the home-baked goodness of Ellie's honey glazed beer bread. Servers are extremely attentive & friendly, and the kitchen accommodated our theater plans with appropriate and timely course delivery. Gnocchi appetizer was just delicious-not a speck of food left on my plate. Pork chop was well seasoned & paired well with polenta side- portion is perfect. I ordered the seasonal dessert tasting which was like having a home-made candy & cookie plate of my very own. All in all, if you haven't been to Gracie's, GO! It's well worth your time & the experience & staff's appreciation for well sourced & prepared food is contagious.
January 10, 2014|Consistently the best|5|My husband and I frequent Gracies as often as we can because, simply put, it's hands down the best restaurant in Providence. The food is creative and high quality. You can feel the love that comes from the kitchen. Also the service and atmosphere are superb. We've never had anything less than the best experience there. Oh, and if you valet, you get cookies in your car to go.
January 9, 2014|A place to share a special moment|5|Many thanks to the staff of Gracie's who always go above and beyond, but particularly this night when everyone (but my then-girlfriend) knew that it was a big night for us -- proposal night. I had made arrangements with staff before-hand, and everything was set and ready for our arrival. Throughout the night, we were congratulated by staff and patrons alike, and the staff were quite cognizant of the fact that my fiancee was making calls to her family and friends and gave us our space. I don't think we ordered until an hour after we sat down! The food was fantastic as always, and the service top-notch. Highly recommend this restaurant to those in the area!
January 9, 2014|One of the best in Providence|5|Gracie's is one of the best restaurants in Providence. The food was fantastic. We did the restaurant week menu. I was sad that they had run out of the swordfish but the duck was so tasty. And you still get all the fancy frills. The atmosphere is so warm and inviting. The waitress was great and recommended a tasty wine that went well with our dinner. The best part was the valet - who not only left cookies in our car but returned the $100 bill my friend accidentally gave him with his tip. That was amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone especially if celebrating a special occasion.
January 9, 2014|New Menu-Best Dinner!|5|They got rid of the confusing up charges and now it is a set price for the pre-fix and let me tell you…we ate like kings. I love their gnocchi, but this time it had butternut squash, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts and it was not only their best gnocchi dish, but one of the best dishes ever!!! Plus the peanut butter ice cream to finish was about the best dessert I have ever too! I cannot wait to go back.
January 9, 2014|Fantastic!|5|My brother and I went to Gracie's for the first time this past Thursday for Restaurant Week. The restaurant itself is lovely and quiet. The service was incredible. I had a nice glass of riesling, and we both started out with the gnocchi, which was fantastic. He had the duck and I had the swordfish for our main entrees. The duck was fantastic, but I wasn't really crazy about the swordfish -- that being said, I had never tried swordfish before and I'm positive that had more to do with me just not really liking swordfish in general rather than anything that the restaurant did wrong. The chocolate banana cake and bread pudding desserts were fabulous. I would definitely visit Gracie's again!
January 8, 2014|We travel an hour just to|5|We travel an hour just to go the Gracie's. Excellent on all accounts. Bravo!
January 8, 2014|Splendid as always|5|Great food, great service, $30 prix fixe for restaurant week, what's not to like?
January 7, 2014|Excellent service and good|5|My husband and I are new to RI so we were ecstatic about restaurant week. A coworker immediately recommended Gracie's as the best bargain during restaurant week because of the quality of food and ambiance. We had the duck and it was amazing! My husband is still raving about it. The wait staff were extremely friendly, polite and prompt. We will definitely be going back on special occasions.
January 7, 2014|I've heard excellent things|5|I've heard excellent things about Gracie's, and it did not disappoint. They were part of Providence's Restaurant Week and offered their traditional 3-course menu for $10 less for it. The food was excellent, the staff was present and more than helpful, and the overall dining experience was perfect. Thanks for a great time Gracie's; you have lived up to my expectations!
December 29, 2013|Favorite Providence Restaurant|5|The service and food is always excellent at Gracie's. The only issue we had at our last visit was the restaurant accommodated a large group in the middle of the dinning room that was large and quite noisy making it uncomfortable to sit in the dining area. We were asked if we wanted to move to the area beside the bar which was nice but did not provide the same feel as the dining room. The noise level from the large group continued to escalate throughout the night. A restaurant the size of Gracie's should consider the impact such a large group may have on other diners.
December 29, 2013|A Star in the Providence Firmament|5|If you've never been to Gracie's, you owe yourself this treat. Really - you do. From the moment you enter their comfortable vestibule (there's even a window seat!), you know this is going to be a special meal. The staff is beyond competent. If you are there for a special occasion, every single person on their staff knows it and quietly offers good wishes, congratualtions, or whatever is appropriate. Service is always top-notch. Gracie's has managed to come up with some of the most delicious cocktails in a cocktail-centric dining scene. Nuff said about that. But they also have a great wine list. As to the food - perfectly crafted plates of your main meat, then little sides to taste along with it. And Elle's desserts - magnificent!
December 28, 2013|One of the best restaurants|5|One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The best desert. Duck was really good.Its a shame that is not in philly.
December 28, 2013|A1 - Food, service & atmosphere|5|We had a wonderful evening at Gracie's. Alex was outstanding in his service and recommendations. The food and wine were delicious and beautifully plated and served. The atmosphere has a 'special' energy and is also friendly - hard chemistry to achieve. Soft lighting - perfect. Treats and amuse bouche to surprise and delight. Totally lovely.
Dined on December 28, 2013|Excellent dinner, great ambiance|5|We chose Gracie's for a family dinner because of its location and the excellent reviews. We all enjoyed our meals a lot -- three of us had the prix fixe dinner, which was a very good deal; three ate a la carte which was pricey but gave more flexibility. The duck was the best we'd eaten outside of France! And the Fois Gras was also delicious. The pasta was unexpectedly good with robust flavor. Three of us had fish and we all enjoyed it. Among the desserts, the creme brule was a standout although the others were good too. Our table was comfortable for our party of 6 and the noise level was pretty low. It was easy for us to hold a conversation without shouting.
December 28, 2013|A night out for two best Friends|5|For two best friends this dining was so good. Food was tasty. We had a table that was not that good so they were quick to change us. They had the restaurant so festive for Christmas. The gift card we received had little star confetti nice touch. Your staff that night was FIVE STARS. We both felt that is so important. They represent your restaurant.
December 28, 2013|We selected the five course|5|We selected the five course tasting with wine. Our server, Lydia was outstanding. Though a pricey evening we enjoyed ourselves and hope to return.
December 27, 2013|Quite a Change|3|This was probably the 4th or 5th trip we have made to Gracie's for a special occasion. While all the other trips were very positive, this trip was equally negative. We were seated on the main aisle near the door and could feel a draft throughout the meal. We also noticed that the service was not of the same level we experienced in the past. It's not that the staff wasn't trying, but it seemed like there was no enough staff and they all had too many tables. It was a good meal overall but not what we have some to expect for Gracie's
December 27, 2013|Amazing birthday dinner|5|My husband and I had the most amazing dining experience at Gracie's. We chose the 5 course menu as it really made the experience truly unique. Every course was delicious. My husband does not care for seafood but 2 of the courses had scallops and monkfish and he loved it and ate every bite! Portion sizes were perfect. Our waitstaff was knowledgeable and friendly. Gravies is the perfect restaurant to celebrate special occasions or just for a special dining treat.
December 20, 2013|awesome|5|Amazing food and even better service. Try the five course tasting..
December 20, 2013|Amazing!|5|I honestly think that the meal we had was outstanding! Not one thing about this restaurant was less than perfect! Obviously it's a bit on the pricey side but if you are willing to spend it you will never be disappointed.
December 19, 2013|Great for special occasions|4|The meal we had was wonderful, but the main reason we picked Gracie's was for the chef's tasting menu. We were unaware this was not available for individual purchase. My husband and I would both have to get it, and I am a picky eater. Other than that the food was very good and the atmosphere was also delightful.
December 14, 2013|Romantic, quaint, and a gem|5|We visited Gracie's for our anniversary dinner. We had lovely cocktails at the quiet and classy bar beforehand. We were seated at a cozy table complete with table sparkles and complementary champagne. We went with the fix pres 5course chef choice with wine pairings. Each dish was unique, perfectly done and beautifully paired. We had an outstanding experience all around. It was one of the best restaurants that I've ever been to!
December 14, 2013|Perfection|5|I was very impressed. Everthing from the atmosphere, drink selection, food (tasting menu) and service was absolutely top notch. The food was beautiful and we savored each bite. The service was outstanding. Friendly & impressively proficient. I would not change a single thing & look forward to going back.
December 14, 2013|Gracie's was Perfect!|5|We were celebrating my childhood best friend's 50th birthday before a concert at the DD Center. I noted that special occasion to Open Table in my reservation. Gracie's made the meal extraordinary! From our wonderful table to the extra attentive service to the spectacular food, it was beyond perfect. We started with complimentary champagne toast and a treat from the chef then went on to scrumptious appetizers (the foie gras was fabulous), delicious dinner and excellent dessert. It was a perfect evening. I would highly recommend Gracie's.
December 7, 2013|Best in area!|5|"Gracie's offers a food ""experience"" with the chef offering surprise tastes of the most flavorful bites beautifully plated. We were there for our anniversary--they offered champagne while we waited (only a few minutes), they sprinkled stars on the candle lit table, they gave us a corner table, and they generally treated us like royalty. If you like something much more than a really good restaurant then go to Gracie's for a true food experience, every bite an exceptional epicurean experience! You will be happy you did."
December 6, 2013|Fantastic as always|5|Yet another creative and delicious round of courses for all 4 of us. The waiters are very well versed in the complex food, and can help with suggestions and give you a heads up as to how the often exotic ingredients will play together. Not a cheap meal, but a full evening of dining and entertainment.
December 5, 2013|Fabulous as always|5|We brought an out-of-town friend here for a birthday dinner, and she raved about the food, saying it was one of the best meals she'd ever had. She can't wait to come back -- and neither can we.
December 4, 2013|Another in a long line of|5|Another in a long line of tremendous experiences. Food was of course the highlight. Service was flawless and the atmosphere was very festive for the holidays. Simply cannot be beat!
November 30, 2013|Best Restaurant in Providence|5|We have been here 3 times now in the past few years. We went this past Saturday with a group of 8 for my wife's 50th Birthday party. They set us up with a private table in the wine cellar room, which was awesome. They had candles lit and a bottle of fine champagne on the house for us to start the evening with a toast. The service as usual was amazing and they work very well as a team at Gracie's. Always on top of things, but never in your face bothering you too much. Its one of those nice 3 hour meals that are so good that everyone is raving the entire time about the food and service. We loved the wine list and enjoyed a few great bottles. We would always recommend Gracie's for a fine dining experience that you will love! 3 course meal!
November 30, 2013|Great spot to celebrate anniversary|5|We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary at Gracie's and were blown away by the exceptional service and food. We'd been looking forward to going for years and finally found the perfect special occasion. Everything from the romantic ambience, to the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff, and the creative and superb menu items, met our expectations for the evening. We will definitely be back to celebrate our next special occasion!
November 30, 2013|Delicious|4|Another delicious meal from Gracies. The fish was cooked perfectly, and we always love trying the small samples that the chef sends out between courses. The only critique was that our creme broulle was a little burnt on top, and left a bit of a burnt after taste.
November 30, 2013|Everything is beautifully|5|Everything is beautifully plated. Small portions which can be expected. Very expensive, we did the 5-course chef special and found myself eating a bunch of bread becaise I was still hungry. Wine list lacks moderately priced bottles. Overall good for a special occasion.
November 30, 2013|Gracie's Revisited|4|In a state that has an abundance of great restaurants,this continues to be our favorite. The service,the food,the ambience,etc are all outstanding and it doesn't change from one server to another. They actually work in teams of two which is very smart and insures impeccable service. The food is excellent and you have a choice of a 3,5 or 7 course price fix. The prices are also very reasonable for the experience that you get I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Providence or RI area.We live 40 minutes away and it is well worth the trip several times a year
November 29, 2013|special|4|We had never been to Gracie's but will definitely be back soon. The sweetbreads appetizer was absolutely delicious and I could have eaten a whole meal of it. Everything well presented and we were totally pleased.
November 23, 2013|Excellent from start to finish!|5|Excellent from start to finish! Would highly recommend!
November 16, 2013|Post proposal dinner|5|My now fiance and I went here after I proposed to her earlier in the day. I had written a note on open table that this was happening and had no idea how they would respond. They went above and beyond with the service and food. Yes, it is quite expensive, but for a special occasion like this it was worth every penny. The staff was respectful and punctual. The food was beyond what I know about food, so I just sat back and let the chef choose the menu. It was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Once I save up a little more money, I'll definitely be back again. Thank you to all the staff, it was a night we'll treasure forever.
November 15, 2013|I love this place!|5|This is our special occasion restaurant. We were there for our three year anniversary and ordered the 7 course tasting. It was fantastic. The food and service was incredible. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to taste incredible food and enjoy themselves.
November 14, 2013|A nice dinner at Gracie's|5|I was visiting Providence with a friend and we wanted a great meal for our last night. Gracie's got good reviews and was a few blocks from our hotel. Lovely atmosphere, very good food, and an attentive staff. My friend has an allergy and they were very accommodating and made sure she wouldn't have any problems. I had the pork chop with polenta and it was the best pork chop I've ever had. Our waiter, Alan, recommended a Trimbach Reisling which went perfect with my pork and my friend's entrée, the special fish, I can't remember what it was right now, but it was also delicious. I had Indian Pudding for desert, you never see that on menus, and it was very nice. My friend had creme brûlée, fantastic. If you're in Providence, Gracie's is a must.
November 14, 2013|Wonderful Meal!|5|Our son is a real foodie, and we usually let him suggest restaurants for us when we travel. He directed us to Gracie's two years ago. We had a fabulous meal then; so we booked it again on a recent visit to Providence. Once again, we were not disappointed. We did the Chef's seven course meal with wine pairing. Every course was delightful and the wine pairings were perfect. Our server Navid was personable and knowledgeable. It was a lovely evening. We look forward to visiting Gracie's the next time we're in Providence.
November 12, 2013|An Incredible Culinary Experience|5|In my opinion Gracie's is the best restaurant in RI and can potentially lay claim to being the best dining experience I've had anywhere. The service was friendly and helpful. It was my wife's birthday and they surprised us with a beautiful table spread and complentary champagne. The food is other-worldly and the use of ingredients from local farms makes me want to frequent the place. Bravo!
November 9, 2013|Immense care is taken to give|5|Immense care is taken to give you a great experience. This is backed up by a superb cuisine.
November 9, 2013|Excellent from start to finish|5|My wife and I had an early dinner at Gracie's on a Saturday night before heading to an event that started at 8 PM. We were 45 minutes late and the staff was very accommodating. Not only did they allow us to keep the reservation but our table was ready as soon as we walked in. We sat down with just over an hour to spare and we informed the staff that we were under a time constraint. They did an amazing job getting us all of our food quickly and made sure that we were out at 8 PM on the dot without feeling rushed. The food also certainly did not suffer as everything tasted great. Our only regret is that we wished we had more time (recommend 2-3 hours for the 3 course prix fixe). All in all a great experience and we can't wait to go back.
November 9, 2013|We had a wonderful time, food|5|"We had a wonderful time, food was excellent, our server(s) were on top of things, pacing courses well. They have free valet parking which was great, dropped the car off about an hour before our reservation and had time to walk downtown, view the ""water fire"" event and get back for dinner then walk to Convention Center for show and back to pick up the car. The next day we noticed a little ""gift"" in our console - two cookies wrapped with a Gracie's ribbon, such a nice touch! Wish we had tried the tasting menu!"
November 9, 2013|Special night out!|5|My husband and I had a fantastic experience at Gracie's!! A must go for a special evening out!
November 9, 2013|Very nice place for dinner|4|We went to Gracie's before a show at the Dunk - very convenient, easy walk. Nice seasonal items on the menu. The food was very tasty and the presentation was outstanding.
November 9, 2013|Had a wonderful dinner here,|5|Had a wonderful dinner here, some of the best duck I've ever eaten, and the bread was fantastic. Extremely good value and quality for the price. The only minor nit was service was a bit less attentive and polished than it should be at a place like this, especially for the time we went (5pm; opening of dinner service). I'd go back without hesitation and recommend to others.
November 2, 2013|Every appetizer and main course|5|Every appetizer and main course for our group of four was outstanding. The duck breast was perhaps the best we've ever tasted (and there have been many).
November 1, 2013|Great|4|Food and Service was fantastic. Gave 4 stars because I felt the prices were a bit high. Don't get me wrong, Gracie's is worth the extra money but it does seem to nickel and dime you. Biggest complaint with pricing is that they have a prix-fixe 3 course with a cost, but then each of the three course have an added cost. I'd rather they just increase the prix-fixe cost and eliminate the extra costs.
October 30, 2013|Special treatment|5|Gracie's staff went out of their way to make our anniversary dinner perfect. We had the special private booth they provided a lovely setup on the table offered us a champagne toast and as always the food was wonderful. They made our night a lovely one.
October 30, 2013|A treat|5|What a wonderful restaurant. Inventive dishes that are delicious, perfect service, just the right amount of attention, excellent food choices, lovely touches to help celebrate a birthday. Everything about this restaurant says thoughtful! Look forward to going back!
October 29, 2013|The restaurant is of the pretentiou|3|The restaurant is of the pretentious variety with the Amuse Buse and palate cleansers. I liked it the first two times I went and found the food held up to the theme of the formal elite dining. However, I went back 2 other times and found the food and service dwindling but not the price. All four visits found limited and poor cocktail offerings of which none were very good. The chicken rolade was very good and the salad was not consistently a good choice. The servers seem to be getting bored with the limitations the restaurant has to food and drink. I think I gave the restaurant more than a fair chance and decided never to return as it very expensive which in of itself is not a turn-off if the whole experience was worth it and its not.
October 29, 2013|Surprisingly Good!|4|Went to Gracie's after a friend recommended it - was delightfully surprised! The food was wonderful and the staff very friendly. The slow cooked farm egg was delicious. While the fish was overcooked, the creme brulee more than made up for it!
October 26, 2013|Never Disappointed at Gracie's|5|Once again the chef at Gracie's dazzled me with seven-courses of delicious fare highlighting the season's fresh root vegetables. The service at Gracie's, while I've never complained about it, seemed even better than ever. The night I dined there, the restaurant was very busy. Still, there was no noticeable delay in getting the seven courses to our table. Loved the first-course (an octopus salad) more than I thought I would!
Dined on October 25, 2013|Disappointed with 5 courses set|4|My wife celebrated my Birthday day with blind 5 course taste set because we had tried their 3 course and enjoyed it very much. However, we're a bit disappointed with our choice. We felt nothing surprise with the taste, produces and ingredients, compared to 3-course.
October 25, 2013|everything was excellent.|5|everything was excellent. Nice touch to serve amuse bouche, sorbet and offer goodies on the way out
October 23, 2013|Tasting|4|We did the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings and it was delicious. I have to say though that it was a little too much...we were the last ones in the restaurant and it took about 3 hours. The pairings were good, but not all were inspired. Having done the 5 course version as well, I think that's a better option. Both are very special and the chef does a wonderful job of customizing to address food allergies.
October 23, 2013|Great pre-PPAC dining|5|Great food, excellent service and a short walk to either PPAC or Trinity. And the macaroons are awesome
October 19, 2013|Brown Family Weekend|3|As the parent of a junior at Brown, I have now had the pleasure of trying many of Providence's best restaurants. On Saturday night of family Weekend, my husband, son, his girlfriend and I had dinner at Gracie's. Without question, the food was very good but I would not put it at the top of our list of favorites to date. My biggest disappointment was the ambiance. I like a restaurant that is a balance of a lively vibe but still allows for some intimacy at our table. We were seated in the middle of the room, with high ceilings and relatively little light. Noise level was high so I had difficulty hearing the guest across the table. Service was professional but slow. Interesting wine selection. Very good cheese plate.
October 19, 2013|Fabulous|5|We went here to celebrate our Anniversary. With all of the great restaurants to chose from in RI this is still our favorite The food,service,atmosphere,teamwork of the staff and attentiveness are all top notch My wife wrote a review on the card at the table and the restaurant sent her a thank you note in the mail. Very classy! This is probably the best restaurant in the state
October 19, 2013|Dining at Gracie's|4|I dined at Garcies for the first time this October and was thoroughly impressed with the whole experience. The food was beautifully plated, and was even more pleasing to the palate. However the Service was the highlight of the night, their prompt service, agreeable demeanors and willingness to please has been unmatched by many of my past dining experiences. I will surely return in the future.
October 18, 2013|Worth many returns|5|Attractive room and nice ambience. Well-informed friendly staff. Imaginative menu and wine list that showed thoughtful consideration for big and bottle. Fairly priced too! All our dishes were excellently prepared and presented. Notable: Sweet breads(app) rare Duck breast(entree) and creme brûlée .
October 18, 2013|interesting food, pricing issue|3|"Gracie's is a cute spot with attentive service and interesting food. The appetizers and mains were well executed, but the desserts were lacking. The pastry chef needs to embrace the use of salt in their desserts and also learn to make a pie crust that isn't so tough. Our main issue is that their menu stated that the pre fix was $40 for 3 courses, but the staff did not explain to us that the majority of dishes on the menu had up-charges if you selected them. What we anticipated to be a $40/person meal was instead a $70/person meal. I remember when our waitress brought us water and then went to get our drinks, she said, ""I'll be right back to explain how our menu works,"" but then she never said anything and just took our order."
October 17, 2013|Great service / food|5|one of the best meals i have had in several years... the service and atmosphere even made it better.
October 15, 2013|Look forward to next time.|4|Outstanding service and complimentary valet! Found a bag of cookies in the cup holder when we got our car back. Noted it was my wife's birthday and they treated us accordingly.
October 15, 2013|Great food|4|I was incredibly impressed with the food. We got the five course tasting menu, and everything was outstanding. Even my friend who tends to be very picky about food ate everything that we were served. The surprise element to the tasting menu made dinner rather interesting. I can't say that the service wasn't good, but I feel like a few of the servers were a bit awkward. It wasn't a big problem though, just something that I noticed. Overall, food was wonderful, and definitely a great place for special occasions.
October 15, 2013|very special meal|5|four of us met for dinner at Gracie's. The food was perfectly prepared , the service excellent, the noise level low enough to never impede our conversations. We found a nice range of good wines, too.
October 12, 2013|This is our MOST favorite place. Service...|5|This is our MOST favorite place. Service/food and drinks are the very best. Would rather go here than any place I Boston.
October 12, 2013|Perfect for special occasions!|5|"Our third time here and it somehow it keeps getting better. Beautiful presentation, service, pacing, special touches and stellar food. Brought another couple who declared it was ""one of the best meals of my life."" We have celebrated two consecutive wedding anniversaries here, because it is that kind of special place."
October 11, 2013|The best food and service bar none|5|So many dinning options here. From a small meal to a seven course dinning extravaganza . Wine paring is available with you meal. Simply put the best dinning experience ever. I have been to literally thousands of restaurents around the world.
October 11, 2013|Good food, bad dining experience|2|"Great appetizers: smoked bluefish pate, slow cooked egg and gnocchi with sausage and broccoli rabe. Great main course duck but the pork chop turned out to be smoked- which our waiter did not mention-and tired the palette after a few bites. Mediocre desserts. Our server was unpleasantly aggressive in his manner. Because we mentioned wanting to stay in a certain price range for wine, his choice of words as he presented his recommendations were condescending: "" Thats a good entry level wine."" Service was inattentive from beginning to end. We were seated at around 8:15 pm and did not finish dinner until 10:30 pm which was fine for us but beware if you do not want a VERY leisurely dinner marked by inattentive service."
October 11, 2013|Incredible food and service|5|We booked a table here for our anniversary and had an incredible experience. We had an incredible waitress and our food and wine were delightful. Highlights were the Duck breast, corn and lobster soup and the gnocchi. They went out of their way to make out anniversary special. Creme brulee and zucchini bread deserts topped it all off. Thank you!
October 10, 2013|Loved Every Bite|5|Service from all staff encountered was outstanding -- courteous, friendly, professional. Our waiter Coleman was terrific, personable, attentive without being intrusive. We had a table for two that was tucked into a little alcove, we felt like we had our own private dining room! Loved the amuse-bouche and the palate cleanser between courses. The corn in the sweet corn soup tasted so fresh you would swear it had just been picked from the garden. Striped bass entree was delicious as was the concord grape popover for dessert. My husband had the potato gnochi app, pork chop entree and zucchini bread dessert, which he also enjoyed very much. The prix fixe 3-course very reasonable, nothing disappointed.
October 5, 2013|OUTSTANDING|5|This was my second visit to Gracie's and I can't wait to go back again. The food was phenomenal and the service was outstanding. I had the Vegetarian chef tasting and I commend the chef for his creativity in the dishes he chose to prepare. They were obviously well thought out, prepared with care, and no detail was missed in creating excellent flavors. The artisan cheese plate was exciting and I love that they use products from local farms and in-season ingredients. Always something new to try at Gracies and I feel like I could not possibly be disappointed in any aspect from valet to dessert!
October 5, 2013|Great|4|Great food and service. Pork chop was outstanding.
October 5, 2013|Great Experience!|5|We had a great experience! The food was wonderful and the service was the best!! We can't wait to return!
October 4, 2013|Great 3 course option|4|Delicious food, well prepared and excellent servers. Will definitely go back.
October 3, 2013|Gracie's- Real Gem in Providence!!|5|This was are second dining experience at Gracie's and they have a proven track record of consistency. The waitstaff is extremely attentive, but not over bearing. Very knowledgeable about the menu items and the wine list. The food quality and presentation is superb. Inventive selection of sustainable selections on the the menu. A true neighborhood gem!! Can't wait to go back!
October 2, 2013|A great dining experience|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Gracie's and had a fabulous meal. We were there to celebrate our youngest son's 21st birthday. The staff picked up on that and helped make it a memorable celebration-- they served us cava and brought him dessert with a candle in it. The food was delicious-- all very carefully prepared and artfully presented. We will return!
October 2, 2013|Foodie Heaven!|5|Well thought out, fresh ingredients for a unique and delicious menu. I had the prix-fix, and was not disappointed. I was plied with so manny surprise amuse-bouche, palette cleansers, artisan breads and apre-desserts, I almost felt as if they were trying to justify the expensive menu. But I didn't mind...it was completely worth it!
October 2, 2013|Incredible service|5|Gracie's has a team approach to service unlike any other restaurant. There were always a group who delivered and removed each if our 5 courses. The courses were the perfect size with an incredible mix of flavored.
October 1, 2013|Best meal, best server|5|We were visiting providence for a work conference and i'm so happy we decided to make a reservation at Gracie's! We had a darling server, Coleman, who really made our experience special. We were seated in the wine room downstairs, which was really fun. The food was OUTSTANDING. Innovative and tasty. I would definitely go back here on my next trip - and I'm definitely going to try the tasting menu next time!!
October 1, 2013|Foodie Treasure|5|I love going to restaurants and trying food. Some years ago had been to Gracie's with a group and we were seated downstairs. It was a theater group and we were seated at long tables. I remember how rushed we were and don't recollect the food at all. On this occaision we were going to the theater and we were seated upstairs. There were three of us. I do remember the food this time because it was the best food that I have eaten in a very long time. There are a handful of restaurants that I have been to that I can say that about. Memorable is the word for the food at Gracie's. Service was impeccable. I will return.
October 1, 2013|we did the $40 special, salads|4|we did the $40 special, salads were delicious and unusual flavors, both main courses substantial, again with great flavors. Took our desserts to go. A tad too much hovering although wait staff was very friendly and helpful, some noisy kids in the corner a distraction, not crazy about the setup of small tables quite close to one another.
September 26, 2013|Good food but spotty service|3|Food was very good overall -although desserts were a bit disappointing . For a restuarant of this caliber it was surprising that the service was not more professional .
September 26, 2013|A great dining experience|5|Gracie's was outstanding. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there and it was a great choice for a special night. All the food was excellent - but ordering the chefs tasting menu is a must! There is a five or seven course tasting (we did the five course) and you can have it paired with wine. The diner does not get to choose any of the items, which made each course highly anticipated, wondering what delight would come next! Don't worry, they do ask you about food allergies or if there are any foods you do not want before you embark on the tasting. Wait staff was excellent as well. Slightly noisy, but outside of that a perfect night out. Highly recommended.
September 26, 2013|Great food great service.Very|5|Great food great service.Very knowledgable staff.I have food allergies and there was no problem in accommodating me.
September 21, 2013|Special Occasion|5|We told Gracie's ahead of time that it was our anniversary (via our Open Table reservation). When we arrived the host acknowledged our anniversary and sat us at a private table. The entire meal and experience was perfect. Nice attention to detail and incredible food. We ordered a la carte (both had the duck -- out of this world delicious.) I started with the slow cooked farm egg (served with mushroom ragout and brioche) and my husband had veal sweetbreads. High caliber chef work. Great Service.
September 21, 2013|Outstanding!!|5|Wife and I had the five course tasting, one of the best restaurant meals I've ever had, you will not be disappointed with Gracie's.
September 20, 2013|Double date with the parents|5|My parents treated my girlfriend and I to a night here and we all had a fantastic experience. Everyone had high praise for their food, our waiter was terrific, the staff was very attentive and the ambiance was great.
September 20, 2013|disaster|1|Gracies used to be excellent. On the night I went they had severely overbooked, with some kind of large party in the basement at the same time the dining room was full. We were seated at 7:15 and ordered by 7:30. The appetizers, 3 of which were salads, did not come out until 8:15. At 8:50, still without main courses, I told the waiter service was unacceptable. There was clear tension in the dining room; twice in half an hour waiters dropped plates of food on the floor which broke loudly The manager came over soon afterwards to apologize and say our main dishes would be out in the next 5 minutes. My dish was only lukewarm. I did get an adjustment on the bill to his credit. Will wait 6 months to return to see what lessons have been learned
September 20, 2013|AmazingT|5|An instructor at Johnson and Wales recommended this place and we are so happy we followed up. We had the 5 course Chef's menu and every course was perfect. Gracie's is on the pricey side, but worth every penny.
September 18, 2013|Wonderful experience|5|Very nice place with very good food. Very interesting offerings and excellent presentation. I would recommend this place to anyone that appreciates a wonderful dining experience.
September 18, 2013|Poor waiter...then good service|4|"My wife and I each eat at Gracie's 10+ times per year- as a couple, with friends and we both book small company dinners there.This time the waiter service was abysmal. We waited 22 minutes until the waiter appeared. He told us he would be back for a drink order, then disappeared for another 10+ minutes. When he did finally deign to serve us, he brought with him a smug attitude undeserving of the restaurant. I was convinced that the evening was going to be a total disaster until we made plea for help to the assistant server. His answer, ""Don't worry."" The assistant server, Alan, then turned into the perfect server. He bought everything promptly, checked back frequently, and was both unobtrusive and charming. In the end, he saved the evening."
Dined on September 17, 2013|Best restaurant in Providence|5|Been to Gracies at least 6 times, and the experience is always uniformly outstanding. Love the 5 course tasting with all its surprises and extras. Expensive but worth it for special occasions.
September 17, 2013|Business dinner|5|Perfect setting to meet for a business dinner. Able to talk without a lot of surrounding noise... A great setting. Food was superb.
September 14, 2013|wonderful food|5|This is our second time at Gracie's, again the food was outstanding. service amazing.
September 14, 2013|Good but not great|3|From the reviews we read and the price we paid we were expecting something great and it was really just good. Had the five course tasting menu with wine pairings. Soup course and meat courses were fantastic. Fish course and scallop appetizer were disappointing. Service was slow. Water and wine glasses stayed empty far too long! Might go back but just for a la carte dining.
September 14, 2013|Great experience, I opted|5|Great experience, I opted for the foie gras appetizer (+13) and scallop entrée (+12) which both had an additional supplement (price) to the standard three course prix-fixe pricing (40). The restaurant is a little price but worth it if you are a foodie.
September 13, 2013|Best Meal I have ever had!|5|My boyfriend and I came to Providence for a weekend getaway from NYC and making dinner reservations at Gracie’s was definitely the best part of our trip. We chose to participate in the 3 course prefixed menu (great deal!) and we enjoyed every last bite. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted so fresh that we felt as though a lot of thought went into the preparation of each dish. Gracie’s is nothing short of a diamond in the rough and we will definitely be making reservations here every time we visit. Also had great attention from our waiter who was extremly knowledgeable on the menu!
September 13, 2013|5 course - fabulous|5|"We've been to Gracie's a number of times. This is the first time we ordered the 5 course prix fix. All courses were something other than what you would find on the menu. Stared with a raw scallop dish, then a fabulous pasta/crab/corn soup kind of thing, then striped bass, steak and finally dessert. The attention to detail is amazing. All the sides were elegant - nothing I had ever had before. The plates were beautiful. The bread is great - everything was wonderful. The waiter was a little ""much"" for my liking, but I think he was just young... The valet puts cookies in your car too."
September 12, 2013|Great food|5|Our friend was the sous chef here and suggested we come in to try their food. it was fantastic. He did an amazing job with every dish that came out. We were so happy with our experience. It is a bit pricey for our taste but it was nice to go out for something special.
September 11, 2013|My wife loved it! The waiter|5|My wife loved it! The waiter had mentioned the desert tasting they do and she immediately started talking to her girlfriends about doing a girls night out there . Happy wife happy life ,thanks agian Gracie's!
September 10, 2013|Special Occasions|5|Romantic spot for special occasions. Pricey but fun.
September 10, 2013|Fabulous|5|Gracie's is one of the best places I've dined in decades. Dennis, our server, was outstanding, and the entrees delighted us with surprising, wonderful, subtle combinations of flavors. We had such a great experience, we went back the following night.
September 7, 2013|Our 3rd wedding anniversary|4|My wife and I decided to spend our anniversary in Providence during the waterfire festival. I got to pick the restaurant, so I did my research and went with Gracie's. We were met with friendly vibes from all employees and they all knew it was our anniversary. We had light appetites so we chose ala - carte, I had the Bershire porkchop and she had the seabass. PHENOMENAL!!! I can't wait to go back and try more of this menu.
September 7, 2013|Didn't change my life|3|The service here was great, very attentive wait staff. The food was very good as well, but perhaps not quite worth the prices charged. The prixe fixe menu was a bit pretentious, in that many of the options included a significant up-charge (doesn't that defeat the purpose of price fixe?). Also, the menu was a bit disappointing in that it was somewhat limited (the night we visited, there was only one steak entree). I had the duck, which was excellent, and my wife had the cod, which frankly, was too small and overpriced. She said it tasted OK, but wasn't anything special. If you're expecting generous portions, this is not the place for you, but the atmosphere was a comfortable chic.
September 6, 2013|We look forward to going again|5|My wife and I had an incredible time. The food is so freshly and delicately prepared! The wine pairings were perfect.
August 30, 2013|Great dinner|5|The food was wonderful, and larger portions than I expected. The drinks were great and the waitstaff was kind, helpful and attentive. Overall a very very nice dinner. I would definitely come back here the next time I want a 1st class meal in Providence.
August 30, 2013|Quite Different Than in the Past|2|We've been to Gracie's several times, usually for special occasions. I alerted them that it was our 5th anniversary when I made the reservation. In the past, they would usually go out of their way to do something nice to acknowledge a special occasion. This time, nobody even mentioned it at all. Not a huge deal, but much different than the Gracie's we are used to. The best duck I have ever eaten was here at Gracie's. Unfortunately, the worst duck I have even eaten was also here, during this visit. It was over-cooked, quite fatty, and just wasn't as close to as good as last time. Not bad enough to send back, but below expectations.
August 30, 2013|Highly recommend Gracie's!|5|Wonderful experience! We were celebrating my son's birthday and they made us feel so special from the moment we walked in! Food, drinks and atmosphere all exceeded our expectations.
August 27, 2013|Great for Dessert|3|I ordered two first courses as I wanted to leave room for dessert. The baby green salad was quite average and the potato gnocchi very tender but overall the dish was quite bland. The zucchini spice bread is one of the best desserts I have had. My husband got the blue fish pate to start and the local fish of the day as his main course. He liked both. His dessert was the market sundae also quite good and we both agreed that the desserts were outstanding. So I think that if we go back there it may be just for dessert... Service was average - I asked for ground black pepper at one point and the server completely forgot about it. I do not find their staff very attentive for a fine dining restaurant.
August 24, 2013|No down side|5|After the meal, Gracie's gave us a little card to fill out about comments. We really had no criticism to offer. Everything was outstanding. Really superb food, excellent service and nice ambiance. Nothing but compliments.
August 24, 2013|Mixed experience|4|We were a party of 6 and the restaurant was full. This may have contributed to very long waits to get drinks, bread, etc. Our servers were charming. The mixed drinks were GREAT! inventive and delicious. The entrees drew mixed reactions. The duck and the scallops were delicious. The chicken dish lost the chicken in its construction. Also the rigatoni dish was spicy rather than flavorful. All presentations were gorgeous and amounts were ample. The desserts were not special. The creme brulee was predictable; the zucchini bread was overwhelmed with molasses. The ice creams were delicious and paired well. The lemon tart was the best. I would try Gracie's again, but for the price, I am looking to be more impressed than I was.
August 24, 2013|Inventive Food, Perfectly Prepared|5|The menu contains inventive combinations, appealing to all the senses. The smoked blue fish appetizer was divine, pate-like in taste, while the warm farm egg had a delightful combination of tastes and textures, making a surprising start to a fine meal. We both had the duck, which had just a touch of cherry sauce, not the cloying type lesser restaurants would have, and the roasted fennel, the baked onions, and the bing cherries beautifully complimented the perfectly done and meaty duck. The flour-less chocolate cake was intensely chocolatey, with a pleasant granular quality. A very good selection of wines by the glass was offered. The service was attentive, while remaining informal, although our spilled water glass was not noticed.
August 24, 2013|Wonderful; served with graqcious|5|Wonderful; served with graqcious spirit and presnted beautifully. Scallops, halibut, sweetbreads, duck, gnocchi, creme brulee, lemon tart all successful. Easily off of I-95.
August 23, 2013|definitely the best restaurant|5|definitely the best restaurant in providence! they were accommodating of my food allergies, even with the tasting menu! fantastic evening.
August 23, 2013|Absolutely the best!|5|My wife & I went to celebrate her birthday. It was a great choice! From the moment we pulled up to the valet, we knew we were in for good experience. Starting with the attendant then hostess & finally, the wait staff - all were fantastic. The drink selection was terrific. The food was diverse, inventive and most importantly, delicious! Everything was so good that we went to Ellie's Bakery (operated by Gracie's pastry chef ) for breakfast the next morning. Food was fantastic there as well! We will be back to both.
August 21, 2013|The food was excellent - creative,|3|The food was excellent - creative, well-prepared and served in appropriate portions. However, the decor is old, tired and not welcoming and the windows in need of serious washing. The wait staff is not very knowledgeable and seems to assume the clientele is equally unsophisticated. Also, don't introduce yourself - that kind of affectation went out long ago.
August 20, 2013|About one of your waitress|2|I was there with a group of 11 people for a special occasion. For my fiancé s birthday dinner. She was very rude and was a smart mouth. She was not friendly was very irritated serving a large group like ours. I would have expected her to be respectful to everyone's requests. Food was really good but not the hospitality by her.
August 20, 2013|Great Food, Slipping Service|3|I have been a fan of Gracie's for some time. Their menu is excellent, and the atmosphere is very nice. This is probably the best restaurant in Providence. However, during our last visit, we had excruciatingly long waits for service. It took 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Our appetizers arrived 45 minutes later, and between each course, we sat and waited at least 20 minutes each time. It was also difficult to get the check and leave. Overall, the service- which is normally pretty good- was terrible. This really put a damper on our meal.
August 17, 2013|Great food|4|Very good food we got the 5 course tasting with the wine pairing,everything was prepared perfectly the only thing I did not like was the spacing, you Are literally sitting on top of two other couples so it feels like they are in your party which I didn't really like but everything else was great.
August 17, 2013|Fantastic Food|5|Fabulous decor and food. A gem in downtown Providence.
August 16, 2013|The service was attentive|5|The service was attentive without being intrusive. There were four of us, each choosing something different and everything from appetizer to dessert was outstanding. I look forward to going back.
August 14, 2013|Just outstanding!|5|This restaurant ranks high on TripAdvisor ans was simply splendid. It's a close walk from downtown hotels, and excelled in the quality and promptness of service, taste and quality of food/ presentation, and portion size. The prices were lower than I would have expected for this kind of dining experience. We did the prix fixe 3 courses which was plenty of food, although 5 and 7 course meals (+/- wine pairings) were also available. Classy, romantic and intimate. You won't go wrong!
August 14, 2013|Good but ...|3|Food was good, service was good with some scattered moments here and there, but what undermined the evening was that it took three hours to get through three courses, which was utterly unacceptable even for a leisurely meal. Maybe it was that we were having the prix fixe as the table next to us was having a chef's tasting and was receiving course after course as we waited a half hour in between our courses. There was an apology by a waitress but none by the manager who seemed to be repeatedly apologizing profusely to the adjacent table after having somehow messed up there tasting menu. Something seemed to be going on in the kitchen ... Anyway, the pasta dish with the spicy sausage ragu was outstanding, not sure it's worth going back though.
August 14, 2013|Special Occasion Dining|5|Wonderful environment, attentive waitstaff and delicious food. Celebrated our42nd anniversary at an intimate table for two illuminated by candle light and festooned with silver stars scattered across the tablecloth. Complimentary champagne served upon seating to honor the occasion and start the evening off. The chefs 5 course tasting with accompanying wine was interesting, tasty, beautifully plated; a fun and unusual approach to dining, rather than just choosing off the menu. You never knew what was coming next but were never disappointed. The waitstaff was excellent; personable and focused on making your dining experience memorable. Can't wait to go back again.
August 13, 2013|Best place ever!|5|The food was absolutely incredible! The service was out of this world! Simply flawless! The cookies in the car was a nice surprise. For it being my first time I can't complain. Went into work bragging about Gracie's
August 11, 2013|Terrific Restaurant|5|Excellent experience. Terrific food, beautifully presented. I have eaten at Gracie's a number of time, but this last meal was the very best. Brought friends from London who concurred that it was an exemplary meal, reasonably priced and excellent value.
August 11, 2013|Must Dine Here Alert!|5|Have heard about Gracie's for years- finally got to experience what all the buzz is about! Had dinner there on Sunday evening and was extremely impressed with Gracie's! The quality of their food, preparation and presentation was nothing short of fabulous. All the dishes were very distinct with their flavors- inventive but not over the top where some chefs loose the diner!! Waitstaff was very attentive but not overbearing. Had drinks at the bar prior to dinner- very cool vibe with a very knowledgeable bar tender plying his mixology to a very appreciative crowd. Gracie's is a must dine location in Providence!!
August 10, 2013|Interior Decoration|5|I'm sure the restaurant has rave reviews about the food and service and ambiance, so I'd like to make a point those were the phenomenal. However, with the quality of everything, what is up with the absurd amount of star decorations? I would not guess this was a high class restaurant from these decorations, maybe there is a back story, but to me it felt weird. Like I said, this is just nit-picking, the service was by far the best I have ever had, so don't let this review detract from experiencing this restaurant!
August 10, 2013|Awesome Gracie's|5|Gracie's far exceeded our expectations. Everything about it was awesome. Definitely plan on going back in the near future.
August 9, 2013|Amazing|5|We absolutely loved our meal. The food was amazing.
August 7, 2013|Armature Hour?|1|"Bad service, waitstaff (plenty) clueless as to what to do. Lack of supervision. Atmosphere - none.... Too dark to read a menu. Butter is seved in ramikins that seem to be almost empty- prompting the assumption that they have been removed from another table. Manager informs me that the reason is ""we found out that many guests do not use all the butter, and much of it goes to waste..."" Ah? you charge plenty from a meal....... How about getting smaller dishes for your butter? The food iyself is not bad, but duck arrived well done, when it was ordered (per the waiter's recommendation as medium-rare. Took 40 minutes to redo the order..... This cannot possibly be the best Providence has to offer."
Dined on August 7, 2013|There are plenty of la carte|5|There are plenty of la carte options off their prix fixe menu. The amuse bouche and the sorbet between courses is a nice touch. It is pricey but all the bells and whistles are in tune with stellar service, great atmosphere, and carefully executed offerings.
August 3, 2013|Food was very different but|5|Food was very different but outstanding. The appetizers and entrees were unique and you have to be willing to try new foods. I was completely satisfied with my meal and the service was excellent.
August 3, 2013|our incredible dinner|5|My hisband and I had a terrific meal at Gracie's on August 3. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent. It was definitely worth the expense. Mary Ellen and Mark Lederer
August 2, 2013|LOVE GRACIE'S!|5|By far my favorite Rhode Island restaurant. I no longer wait for a special occasion to go. Gracie's is an experience, not just eating out.
August 1, 2013|Worth it!|5|Great combination of freshness and fine dining. A true gem
July 27, 2013|Best in Providence|5|My fiancée and I had the 5 course tasting with wine pairings. All 5 courses were excellent. We also discovered some great wines. Our server was kind enough to write them all down on very nice notecard. Definitely do go to Gracies's. We'll be going back next time we're in Providence.
July 27, 2013|Perfect in every way|5|"This was our second visit to Gracie's - we are from out of town and stop in Providence on our way to Truro. We wish Gracie's were closer to home. The food is prepared with so much care, bringing together flavors beautifully without any of the fussiness we find in some ""fine-dining"" restaurants. Everything, for us, was perfectly presented and the ingredients that the chef chooses to combine compliment each other - we loved the smoked bluefish appetizer, the scallops, the striped bass, the corn pastry + berry dessert and our Sancerre! Our waiters were attentive and gave great advice on the food. I look forward to returning the next time we're in Providence."
July 25, 2013|A lovely birthday dinner for 2|5|My boyfriend and I are on a serious budget, so we save up our monthly allowance for eating out so that we can go all out when we do. Gracie's was worth every penny and every can of tuna we ate to save up for it! It's a fancy-pants dining experience, without the snobbery. It's also the local, farm-to-table, we-grow-our-herbs-on-the-roof (they do!), take no shortcuts approach to great food, without being pretentious. EVERYTHING is delicious, but I have to say, we've ordered duck 3 times over the course of our visits, and each time it's prepared differently, each time the best duck we've ever had. It's the perfect place to have a lovely, leisurely meal you'll relive over and over with utter glee. Enjoy!
July 20, 2013|Likely because of restaurant week..|3|This visit wasn't up to what we expect from Gracie's. Food quality was excellent, as always, but service usually takes a hit during these promotional times. Had to wait so long for our cocktails that the manager comp'ed them. Nothing about our visit would stop us from going again (just not as soon), and we understand the need to promote a business to new customers, but you still hate to see a beautiful dining experience unrealized, especially when prior visits have all been so excellent.
July 20, 2013|Always great|5|We have been to Gracie's numerous times and always have a wonderful meal. Portions are not large but perfect size for us. Food is always unique and I have never had anything I didnt love. Wait staff and bartenders are very knowledgable. Will keep going back!
July 20, 2013|top spot on prov.|5|"Went on July 20th early, which got us our favorite table. Every one was great, as always. Over the years we have been to--or examined the menus of--every restaurant that does prov restaurant week. Gracie's uses the week to let itself shine. The others are begrudging: CAV having a watermelon slice as a RW app is the epitome of that. Thus, it is the only ""fine dining"" place in prov we go to the rest of the year. If it is not Gracie's (or Persimmon, Bristol), we go for good cheap ethnic food. Gracie's is a special place for us. If you have to take to a ""fancy place"" someone from NYC, SF, LA, etc., it is your best option. It does our town proud."
July 19, 2013|No one does duck better than|4|No one does duck better than Gracie's! I've found another place that does it as well but not better.
July 19, 2013|Gracie's is the best|5|As always - food, suggested wine pairings, and service were impeccable. Have never had a bad experience at Gracie's!
July 18, 2013|Great choice for a night out!|5|I took my husband to Gracie's for his birthday and it was nothing short of perfect. When they found out it was his birthday, they brought us over two glasses of champagne for a toast, and put a little quote and sparkles on our table! The food was outstanding, and the service was the best we've had in a long time. Thanks Gracie's!
July 18, 2013|Exceptional|5|Wonderful in every way, even economical on the night we were there (during Providence Restaurant Week). Ordinarily it would be high-end but worth every penny.
July 17, 2013|PERFECTION!|5|The BEST striped-bass I have ever had. This place really knows how to treat their guests! I love the star-themed decor as well:)
July 17, 2013|We were given a table for|4|"We were given a table for two in the front window area which is also the bar area. Fortunately most people at the bar were waiting for tables so it quieted down pretty quickly. I will note that the main dining room is also very noisy. The food was terrific and the service as well. I found the various tasting menu options and pricing a little confusing. In the end my guest and I decided to just order what we wanted and let the server sort out which option it was (he did). Only negative was the table for two was tiny and the seating was perpendicular to each other, not across. As the two of us are not a ""couple"" we had to work out where to put our feet so our knees weren't touching. All in all a very nice experience."
July 17, 2013|Super!|5|I believe this is now the best restaurant in Providence!!!!!
July 17, 2013|It is there when you need it|5|Great place that is still superb after all these years. If you want great meal and great service in a very stylish atmosphere and don't want to drive outside Providence, this is the place.
July 16, 2013|Outstanding Restaurant|5|We love Gracie's. We always have such a great experience dining there. The food is among the best we've ever had. The ambience is charming and romantic. The service is friendly and attentive. Always an unforgettable experience!
July 16, 2013|Great Downtown Providence Gem|5|My boyfriend and I went to Gracie's on a Tuesday night for the Providence Restaurant Week dinner option. It was great to see that the menu options were pulled from the regular menu. The potato gnocchi was fantastic. We had the duck and swordfish entrees which were fantastic. The desserts were delicious, as well. Throughout dinner we also got to sample bread from Ellie's Bakery. The service was wonderful. I really can't say enough - can't wait for the next time I'm back!
July 16, 2013|Amazing dinner experience|5|I went to Gracie's for restaurant week. And even though we were paying less for the pre-fix restaurant week menu, Gracie's still pulled out all the stops. Their service was amazing and incredibly attentive. All of the courses were perfectly spaced out and completely delicious. Gracie's melts so many fantastic flavors to give you a wonderful food experience. You can tell that everything they cook with is so fresh. Gracie's is definitely one of the best dining experiences I have ever had, so if you are in the mood to treat yourself, definitely go here.
July 16, 2013|Not a great visit|1|First thing I had was a roll with a bit of butter and got a mouthful of salt. Awful! I had the tomato and peach salad which was nice but not extraordinary. The rigatoni with ricotta was another failure with too little tomato and too much insalata ricotta which I removed from the dish because it too, made the dish salty - yet bland. I can do better at home. The Plum biscuit was also a grand disappointment. Instead of a lovely dense confection, the biscuit was a soggy piece of sponge like cake with some sort of thin crust at the bottom. The amuse bouche were less than delectible and the black polenta was just bad. Perhaps I made bad choices - although the others did not appeal to me. We were all disappointed with our meals.
July 16, 2013|Superb dining|5|"Superb dining. Probably the best in Providence. We return here frequently. One minor complaint. I wish the personnel would not use the kindergartenish ""we"", as in ""how are we doing?"" Or ""Are we ready for dessert?"""
July 13, 2013|The food was fantastic. My|5|The food was fantastic. My wife has food allergies and the staff was able to work around them. Even the person bringing bread to the table was aware to bring her olive oil rather than butter as she can't have any dairy. The kitchen and wait staff were very well coordinated. I had the duck confit and it was well prepared and tasted great. My wife had the swordfish and it was super.
July 13, 2013|Gracie's is special|5|The plates are both artfully arranged and beautiful, and delicious taste sensations. I had three appetizers (no entree) because I couldn't decide what to give up. There is a lot of help, seemingly dozens of people passing by your table with watchful eyes, picking up finished plates, filling water glasses, passing bread - a team effort. I can't wait to go back.
July 13, 2013|Best dining experience ever|5|Everything about Gracie's was perfect. The service was great, the servers never let our water glasses get less than half way empty, they were able to answer all of our questions and we were checked on many times. The food was amazing Everything was so fresh and cooked correctly. All of the courses were the perfect size and nothing was overwhelming.
July 12, 2013|Great time at restaurant week|5|We had a great dinner! Everything was delicious! Service a little slow but did not take away from the amazing food!
July 12, 2013|Delightful Romantic Dinner for Two|5|My girlfriend and I went to Gracie's to partake in Providence's Restaurant Week and were not disappointed. Though a bit pricy, the food is more than worth it. The duck was simply divine.
July 12, 2013|FIrst Time, but not the last|5|This was my first time at Gracie's and the experience was wonderful. They catered to our every need and made sure that we were happy. The food was outstanding and is just one of the reasons to go back. The ambiance, the staff, the flawless service,and the effort that went into each dish are truly reasons to go back. Cannot wait to eat there again.
July 10, 2013|What a great evening!|5|One of my favorite restaurants in Providence. As always, the food was incredible and the service impeccable. The amuse-bouche treats in between the courses are a decadent addition and this evening they were particularly stellar. That bluefish pate! A do-not-miss restaurant for Providence and definitely a top pick for restaurant week!
July 10, 2013|Felt Appreciated|5|Our experience started off a little slow as we had to wait for more than 15 minutes before actually being seated. But once seated we had a fabulous dining experience. Our entire group enjoyed the high level of service as our needs were met by a multitude of wait staff. Further we enjoyed the little extras that accompanied our meal like the crab appetizer, the sorbet, and the dessert tasting. The food was great as our entire table readily shared their meals with each other including my daughter who tried crab, duck, and bass for the first time and loved it. Our meal was topped off with a pleasant visit and discourse with the chef. Fabulous time by all!
July 10, 2013|Food vs. service|5|The only thing better than the food was the service. Both were beyond outstanding.
July 9, 2013|One of a kind|5|Incredibly creative menu, flawlessly presented. Waitstaff professional and very friendly - the best ever experienced. Gracie's in a class of its own in Providence.
June 28, 2013|Absolutely amazing!|5|"My girlfriend and I came here for our 6-month anniversary and we both agree that it was the best American dining experience we've had so far. When we announced that we were here for our anniversary, they rushed some ""decorations"" to the table and gave us a complementary champagne toast, it was nice. Our waiter, Eric, suggested doing the 5 course pairing which is an unique experience for the restaurant where the chef custom makes 5 courses based on your likes and allergy needs. We decided to go with it because this was our first and maybe only time here, so we wanted to try something special. It was an amazing meal and the experience was made even greater by the friendly staff."
June 28, 2013|Gracie's Never Lets You Down|5|We travel 25 miles to come to Gracie's and each time we are never dissapointed. The food is always amazing. The staff is very well trained and well versed on the menu. This visit was the last service before they take thier July break but it was like they would be open the next day. Well done!
June 27, 2013|Love Gracie's!|5|The ONLY thing I don't like about Gracie's is that the tables are a bit too close together. The food and service is outstanding.
June 26, 2013|Extraordinary|5|Gracie's is a truly amazing restaurant. The food was exquisite and unparalleled. The waitstaff were unmatched in their service and friendliness. I have never had a dining experience like this before and only hope that more people can experience the joy my wife and I did at Gracie's.
June 22, 2013|Fois Gras: awesome. served|5|Fois Gras: awesome. served warm and with unexpected sides, but it worked Pea Flan: bursting with flavor. it tasted so fresh and green. Gnocchi : with peas, carrots, and flavorful meat. temperature was very hot and served in a bowl. Black Sea Bass: first bite tasted a bit fishy (with skin on), but taste improved with each bite. Scallops: wonderful! seared to perfection with delicious sides. i would order this over the sea bass as my primary main next time.
June 21, 2013|Expensive and average food|3|The service was ok but waiter could have told the chef about the bones in the fish instead of telling us to fill out the card.. The breads were really good too. But the portions are small. The first scallop I had was sandy. Nice presentation but 4 was hardly enough for an entree. My husband had the sea bass. It was so small hard to see on the plate and loaded with bones. Good thing they give you a few tasting spoons in between courses. We were there for a special birthday. Not sure we would go back.
Dined on June 20, 2013|World Class Dining|5|I have eaten all over the world, including Paris , & this was possibly the best meal I have ever had.
June 20, 2013|Full of Grace and Gratitude|5|"Gracie's never disappoints - the food is imaginative and delicious; the service gracious and attentive without being intrusive; and dining here again and again I am mindful that everyone on staff is working to make the experience special. Serving staff remember that you have been there before; in fact one of the guest dining with me that evening indicated she might go into ""Gracie withdrawal"" because next week she would not be dining there. Kudos to the entire Gracie team...so grateful for this restaurant being part of downtown Providence."
June 20, 2013|Another simply fantastic evening.|5|Another simply fantastic evening. The tasting menu is always a bonus with new and creative options not seen on the menu.
June 19, 2013|"My ""go to"""|5|When I want to assure people have choices and a unique food experience, Gracie's is my go to place.
June 19, 2013|This was a disappointing experience|3|This was a disappointing experience. We ordered the 5-course prix-fixe. The meat course was squab which were microscopic and had no meat. The dessert course was a French toast novelty. Not to be repeated.
June 18, 2013|Out-of-Sync Experience|3|We enjoyed the food at Gracie's very much. The chef put together an excellent vegetarian meal for my husband and everything was generally excellent. Unfortunately our server was disengaged and so low energy it truly distracted from our experience. Our other issue was that the food and the ambiance of the restaurant were quite mis-matched. Not the most important thing but added to the weak service to make our evening kinda of meh.
June 15, 2013|Overall good experience|4|First time to Gracie's - new to the area. had the 5 course service. Food was out of this world. If it were not for lousy service would have given 5 stars. Our head waitres was very nice but the rest of wait staff and the bartenders were less than pleasant. Put somewhat of a damper on an otherwise great evening. The food saved it...would go back just for that reason.

June 14, 2013|Gracie's Review|3|My wife and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at Gracie's and this was our our visit. Gracie's was recommended to us by many locals and our expectations were high. We dine out a great deal so we consider ourselves fair critics. We enjoyed our appetizers and desserts, but found our entrees average. Considered the overall cost-to-value ratio very high. We gave 5-stars to presentation, 3-stars to quality. Service was friendly, yet could have been a bit more professional. Gracie's ambience is NOT suited for a romantic experience; too loud and disturbing for our taste.
June 14, 2013|Wonderful except for pre-theater|4|The experience and food at Gracie's is always wonderful. Service is always remarkable until midway through the main (second) course of the three course meal. Then the staff seems to disappear, and the dessert ordered at the beginning of the meal doesn't appear. Twice now we have almost missed a curtain despite informing everyone of our theater schedule, and despite booking a reservation for 1.75 hours prior to the curtain (theater is across the street). I will happily return to Gracie's, but not when heading for the theater.
June 13, 2013|Make the trip....|5|Beautiful restaurant with incredible service and food. I will continuously recommend this restaurant to all for a romantic evening or any other special evening.
June 11, 2013|Always Great!|5|It was a special occasion and a pre-theatre dinner. You can always count on Gracie's for great service, spectacular food, huge Martini's and friendly, superior service. Our server Kristi stayed aware that we needed to be in our theatre seats for a 7:30pm curtain without rushing us. She was a master. One of our favorite dinner venues.
June 8, 2013|We did the chef's tasting|5|We did the chef's tasting with wine pairing and it was just perfect. The wine was interesting, the dishes were unique (and delicious) and the overall experience was totally worth the trip to Providence!
June 6, 2013|Gracie's is a remarkable restaurant|5|Gracie's is a remarkable restaurant. Everything is first rate. Clearly, the #1 restaurant in Providence.
June 1, 2013|SPECIAL EXPERIENCE|5|THE 5 COURSE TASTING WITH WINE PAIRING WAS OUTSTANDING. THIS RANKS AS ONE OR OUR TOP RESTAURANT EXPERIENCES.
June 1, 2013|Perfect graduation celebration|5|Our daughter had graduated from RISD in the morning and we wanted nothing less than a perfect dinner celebration. There were four of us - my husband, two daughters who had just graduated from college and me. We got what we wanted and had a dinner to remember for years to come. The food was outstanding and the service was incredible. The timing of serving the various courses was just right. We enjoyed the synchronized serving, and when four servers descended on our table all at once, we did feel special. Special mention goes to our daughter's good friend from high school Coleman who added an extra slice of care and attention. Wonderful experience!! Will plan on returning when we are in Providence!!
May 31, 2013|Chef's Special was Awesome|5|Eric, our waiter, recommended that we try the 5-course chef's special. My wife was concerned because we had no idea what they would be serving. Well, I can tell you that each course received was better than the last. We loved both the uncertainty of the process and the food (especially the food). I would recommend leaving your dining experience in the very capable hands of the chef. We did and we LOVED IT! Thanks Eric.
May 31, 2013|World Class Food and Service|5|Gracie's has been our favorite place to celebrate special occasions for any years. The food is spectacularly prepared and presented. There are menu options to suit everyone including a la carte, 3 course prix fixe selections from the menu, and 5 and 7 course chef's tastings, all available with excellent wine pairings. There is even a chef's three dessert tasting, which was amazing and was also available with wine pairings. While the chef's tastings are not from the menu, our wonderful waiter asked detailed questions about our likes and dislikes. The dishes were all superb and varied, and the wine pairings perfect. Given the food quality, the tariffs are quite reasonable. We look forward to our next excuse to dine there.
May 30, 2013|AWESOME!|5|We were celebrating a 50th B-day and the celebrant generally does not prefer to be the center of attention. The staff got it just right - discrete yet warm acknowledgement. Even better was the food - the flavors / textures and portions were perfect - it was ambrosia from start to finish. I truly can't think of why we haven't graced Gracie's more often but we certainly shall. For those of you in Provdence - all I have to say is lucky you!
May 30, 2013|I rarely rave|5|But this restaurant, its chef and sous-chefs, the entire staff, are all outstanding. Worth taking a long drive to Providence for a meal at Gracie's.
May 30, 2013|Graduation Gift|5|I'm one of those broke college (well, now graduated) students who view cheapness as one of the most important aspects of dining. When my parents surprised me with dinner at Gracie's I was actually disgruntled to be spending more than $15 on dinner. My stinginess was quickly replaced with wonder as our first courses appeared. I was blown away by Gracie's... And I savoured every moment of it without even arguing with my mom once. That's saying a lot! The ingredients were fresh - I'm guessing local- and the dishes were all traditional with a subtle twist that made them modern and unique. Service and the extras (notably the strawberry-rhubarb sorbet sample to cleanse the palate) were great, what a special graduation gift. Thank you Gracie's!
May 29, 2013|Five Course Tasting w/ Six Friends|5|AMAZING! I took friends who have never been to tasting before and they were treated to an evening of true fine dining. We ate, we drank, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Gracie's is, by far, the best restaurant in Providence. Thank you!
May 29, 2013|Gracie's Never Disappoints|5|When you don't mind spending a little extra and want a sure-thing dining experience Gracie's is your place. The food is always delicious, service top notch, and local foods are served in unique combinations.
May 26, 2013|Amazing!!|5|This is our 2nd time visiting Gracies! It was an amazing experience. We mentioned that it was our 7 year anniversary and they reserved the special table for us (which was very quiet and romantic) and gave us a complimentary glass of champagne for a toast. Everyone who approached us knew it was our anniversary. We had the 5 course tasting menu and everything was so thoughtfully prepared. The food is amazing! The service is the best I have ever experienced....no detail is overlooked. Even the valet left little cookies in the car. Highly recommend!
May 25, 2013|A One-of-a-kind Dining Experience|5|"Gracies does not just make food, they craft an entire dining experience that leaves you feeling full, as well as completely taken care of. My girlfriend has celiacs disease (no gluten) and often feels a little uncertain and uncomfortable even when a restaurant says that things are gluten free. At many other restaurants the staff will acknowledge her needs by simply remove the gluten-containing things; a sort of ""no bread for you, sorry"" mentality. At Gracies, the staff expresses empathy for her and always brings a special gluten free ""treat"" instead to make up for the fact that she can't have the fresh baked bread or end-of-meal macaroons. This hospitality sets Gracies apart, and no detail of the dining experience is left out."
May 24, 2013|Favorite restaurant in the world!|5|Gracies is the standard by which we measure all other dining experiences. Other restaurants have been comparable but Gracies is still the best.
May 24, 2013|Spectacular....once again|5|Every time we go to Gracie's it is a great experience. The food, service and ending with delicious cookies from the valet. Bravo..once again!
May 23, 2013|The waitress was very rough|2|The waitress was very rough and not accommodating at all to our demands as costumer. Food was good.
May 23, 2013|Highly recommend Gracie's|5|Our favorite restaurant in Providence! food is always outstanding and the service is always excellent.
May 22, 2013|We went for the chef's tasting|5|We went for the chef's tasting with pairings. All were quite delicious and well-worth the fuss and the price. High-quality, seasonal ingredients. Pairings were spot-on. Thank you for a wonderful anniversary dinner!
May 18, 2013|Graduation Dinner|5|I think this is my 3rd visit and again everything was wonderful. There were 4 of us and it is always so neat to see 4 waitstaff persons descend to place places for everyone at the table all at once. I had Black Bass and it was terrific. The new JWU Culinary School graduate had the steak and he was working hard to finish it - it was huge.
May 18, 2013|Great Experience!|5|We had the 7 course tasting menu and loved each one. The pairing of the foie gras with grilled apricot was perfect and the soft shell crab was crispy on the outside while remaining succulent inside. The lamb was buttery and melt in your mouth. Service was smooth and attentive without being intrusive. There were a couple times when we started to wonder where the next course was but then there they'd come. A great choice for special occasions but you need to make a reservation early.
May 18, 2013|Gracie's is Great!|4|We dined here as a celebration for our daughter's graduation from college. Gracie's went out of their way to make our dinner a festive occasion and even decorated the table with confetti! The food was great and the service outstanding. We will go back and would recommend this to our friends.
May 18, 2013|Graduation dinner|5|My family and I came in for graduation dinner on Sunday 5/18. Everything was outstanding. The table received a complementary toast with a splash of bubbly upon arrival. 2 members in the party made modifications to their entrees, & the kitchen, as well as Eric out server, were more than accommodating. The wine list is reasonably priced, & has a very nice, well organized selection. Our service team was awesome; never skipped a beat, & made the evening a very memorable experience. This was the perfect way to say goodbye to Providence. My ONLY, & I mean only, complaint is that I wish the vegetable course was bigger; it was delicious & beautiful, but smaller than expected- BUT the foie gras was the biggest piece of foie that I've ever seen
May 17, 2013|Great Meal|5|Each course was outstanding! Best creme brûlée I've ever had. Excellent service.
May 17, 2013|This restaurant was perfect.|4|We went to Gracie's for a before theater dinner. Although the theater experiecne was forgetable the dinner at Gracie's was excellant. We enjoyed our time there and they did everything they could to make it an enjoyable experience for us. The place was not crowded in the earlier part of our time but even when it filled up the noise level was excellant. We did speak to the table to our side but it was a pleasant experience and not intrusive for either of us.
May 16, 2013|Twice in a row. Service/ticket|2|Twice in a row. Service/ticket times do not match the pricepoint or acclaim of this restaurant.
May 12, 2013|very nice|4|Overall very nice place. Food was great. Service was also very good. The only disappointing thing was that they have a pri fix menu or a tasting menu option which was interesting and intriquing, however the server after explaining the menu failed to mention that if someone in your party want to choose a tasting all members must choose a tasting. I get it from a timing standpoint however 2 members were interested in the tasting and 2 were not so they had to rethink their options after already looking forward to their choice.
May 11, 2013|Excellent food and ambiance|4|"The food was amazing, the waiter was great and the atmosphere is fun and special. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu which was outstanding. Our only issue was with our reservation. We arrived on time for our 8 p.m. reservation and were told our table wasn't ready yet and to go to the bar. We enjoyed a glass of wine and waited. And waited. We finally asked what the status was on our table and were told that somehow another party took our table when they ""couldn't find us."" I am not sure how they couldn't find us when we were seated in the middle of the bar we were told to sit at. Regardless, they found us a table at 9:30, and picked up the tab for our bar bill. Not happy about the late meal, but would try again for the great food."

Dined on May 10, 2013|Words do not do justice!|5|You really have to experience Gracie's for yourself! Food, excellent service, great wine list! Went for Mother's Day dinner, now it will be a tradition! Gracie's IS THAT GOOD!
May 9, 2013|Just good enough|3|Truly, I expected more. There was lots of show, but not much go when it came to the food itself. It was adequate fare, but should have been better and more carefully prepared, treated with more of a chef's hand if you will instead of a line cook. The courses came erratically I thought, and the over-solicitous wait staff did not deliver on the real service. More smiley in your face than knowledgeable and attentive. The wine pours with the Chet's menu were miserly and small, I felt shorted on that account, perhaps even more acutely than the 'good' food. It was good, but not really good, and did not justify the pricing. It is a pleasant atmosphere though.
May 9, 2013|Gracie's|5|It was an amazing dinner from beginning to end. It was so fresh and delish! The whole place, clean as a whistle and has a great ambiance. I would go back tonight if I could! Wonderful....just fantastic food.
May 4, 2013|Tasting|4|The 5 course tasting menu was fantastic but pricey. Worth it for a special occassion.
May 4, 2013|Foodgasm|5|Awesome blending of flavors I would not think to try on my own. The 5 course was outstanding! Stepped slightly outside of my comfort zone in allowing the chefs to choose our dishes, but it was well worth it. A+
May 3, 2013|It's all about the tasting menu|5|Gracie's standard menu is wonderful. But, when you let the kitchen get creative with the 5 or 7 course tasting menu... You're in for a real treat! The freshness of the food is amazing. The quality of the waitstaff can't be beat!
May 2, 2013|Great except for coordination!|3|The food is great at Gracie's. and the wait staff is friendly and nice. But in our party of four, three of the our drinks arrived much later than the first one. The waitress wanted to take our order before the rest had arrived. And we had a similar problem at desert where one person waited. And waited. Otherwise, a great place! We will go back. This may have been an off nite.
May 2, 2013|Outstanding service, excellent food|4|Had a great evening - servers were attentive and personable, food was excellent, just not much of it. If you're looking for the un-steakhouse, this is it! Seafood, duck, and shellfish were all perfectly done. All in our party ordered desserts due to the small portions, only to find that the desserts were equally tiny. Plan to head over to Pastiche for a real dessert after dining and you'll be pleased.
May 2, 2013|Great as always|4|There aren't enough words to describe how much I love eating here. Great front of the house staff as well as back of the house. The Owner and Executive Chef do a great job of making sure you have the best experience and if for some reason you aren't, they will make it right. I love this place!
May 2, 2013|Gracie's - tops anywhere|5|Very stylish restaurant, obviously popular with a well-dressed crowd. Service was excellent from the welcome, to seating, explaining the menu and how it works, to putting food on the table. We were pressed for time since we had a show to go to and the staff were aware of that and responded accordingly. The food was very well prepared and presented. A parsnip soup appetizer was quite novel and outstanding. My steak and my wife's duck were superbly cooked. We will be back whenever we return to Providence from Cape Cod.
May 2, 2013|A little disappointed|4|We are very conflicted about our visit. We've had their food before (via their caterings) and were always impressed. We live an hour away, so when seeing a show at the PPAC, we just had to go! Our server was very attentive to our needs and time constraints. He recommended the 5 course menu for timing. We also did the wine pairings. The food was good. I didn't need to have microgreens on every plate, though they were always present. The wine was paired well. Dessert was disappointing (corn bread, really?). We ate everything and left a little hungry. Dinner was paced nicely, but the constant barrage of servers was distracting. It was good, but not memorable. We expected to be wowed and left somewhat disappointed.
April 30, 2013|Impeccable service!|5|I loved every attention to detail. Made dining there feel like a real special occasion. The 5 course tasting was perfect for a first time there and looking forward to going back!
April 27, 2013|Great Restaurant|5|I can't say enough about this restaurant. I booked a reservation online based on reviews from tripadvisor. I must say that the experience did not disappoint. I was looking for a place that was romantic since I wanted to treat my girlfriend to a well-deserved date night in town. Right from the start I was impressed with the attention to detail. The staff had taken the time to delicately ornate the table with silver stars. In addition, we were greeted by a series of waitstaff that were both knowledgable of the product and enthusiastic about describing the choices on the new menu.
April 26, 2013|Gracie's is my favorite restaurant|5|Gracie's is my favorite restaurant in Providence; really excellent service and food The vegetarian options are really tasty and well thought-out, which I really appreciate. And the prix fixe is one of the best deals in town.

April 16, 2013|This was my 2nd time at Gracie's|4|This was my 2nd time at Gracie's and I've been impressed again. The service was excellent, and the food was top notch. I'll definitely be back.
April 13, 2013|Special occasion destination|4|We always like Gracie's for a special occasion. The food is a combination of many unusual ingredients presented in an artistic manner. There are a variety of entrees that are unique to this restaurant like rabbit with gourmet accompaniments. The apricot with white chocolate bread pudding with honey and a pistachio sauce was disappointing. To me it lacked taste and was very dry. The ginger ice cream with it made up for the not so tasty bread pudding. If you want to experience some gourmet food, this is the place to go.
April 13, 2013|special place|5|Gracie's is one of those special occassion places where you go to for a little romance and a splurge. Between the specialty food items and the special treats you feel special when you go there. Because of the prices it is reserved for special occassions only.
April 9, 2013|My favorite restaurant. Food|4|My favorite restaurant. Food is delicious. Loved the pineapple-hibiscus sorbet between courses. Only problem is that the menu hasn't changed much since the fall. I'd love to do the tasting menu - which has more spring items on it, but my companion didn't want to do that. Tried the new Night Shades drink - which was delicious - but quite spicy. Service is great although I felt a little rushed. Also the tables are so close that you can't avoid feeling in the middle of several conversations. Will go back because the food is so amazing.
April 4, 2013|My Best Meal Ever|5|This may be the best meal I've ever had. The food was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented, by enthusiatic, well informed, personable staff. The menu was inventive and provided three different options for ordering and pricing; a la carte, price fixed and chef's choice.The elegant ambience is romantically candle lit with a sense of intimacy yet allowing generous spacing between tables. If all of this was not wonderful enough, when we retrieved our car from valet parking, there were two delicious cookies left on the seat for us. I cannot wait to return.
April 4, 2013|Food and service was excellent.|5|Food and service was excellent. One of the best restaurants you will find anywhere in New England. Casual, and yet suitable for special occasions, business dinners, etc. There is nothing on this menu that won't delight you.
March 30, 2013|Impressive|4|My first visit and was thoroughly impressed. Who would have thought that parsnip soup could be so enjoyable? You could see that attention is paid to everything, even the fingerling potatoes had been oven-roasted before being added to the sauce with my baked cod. Flavors were full but not overbearing. Had heard good things about Gracie's and happy we decided to try it. Will go back.
March 29, 2013|The wait staff needed to be|4|The wait staff needed to be more attentive...too many times plates sat on the table empty for over 10min

March 29, 2013|Gracie's lives up to the hype|5|In my two years in Providence, I've tried to visit every major restaurant with a reputation for excellence. Of the places I've tried, Gracie's was not only one of the best, but managed the rare feat of actually being better than it's been billed. The duck neck confit was succulent, the fois gras was delicious and very well balanced with a marmalade crustini. Both our entrees, the duck and the rabbit, were tremendously balanced. Everything was cooked to perfection, lightly crisp, and featured the meats excellently. Desert was solid, not amazing, though we actually got a second helping accidentally. The drinks were phenomenal, Keith is an absolute master. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone despite the price.
March 28, 2013|Had the five course meal,|5|Had the five course meal, with all courses being a surprise, i.e. you don't know what's coming. Each course was excellent in terms of taste and originality (skate wing; squid ink pasta....). I wasn't prepared for the size of each course which was on the small side, but at the end of the meal I was full, so it's a mental thing more than anything. And the uniqueness and taste of each course outweighed the portion size in the end. I would order the five course meal again. My compliments to the chef.
March 23, 2013|You Get What You Pay For!|5|Excellent food, well prepared and beautifully presented. Service second to none. Pricey but worth it. Among our favorites on the Providence restaurant scene.

Everyone who greeted us wished us Happy Anniversary, they elegantly bedazzled our table with table confetti, and started our dinner off with a complimentary glass of Cava. We chose the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings and it was outstanding - each bite was packed with flavor and the portions were perfect. I must have said, ""I had such a great night"" about 10 times between Gracie's and our hotel! I HIGHLY recommend dining here!"

March 8, 2013|Food is good, but tends to|3|Food is good, but tends to get complicated by so many ingredients so that after a couple of bites you tend to forget what you actually ordered. Service is very attentive and efficient, but also too conversational. It's fine to ask me how I enjoyed my meal, but let's not get carried away by continuing on and theorizing why I enjoyed it by describing the infusion of this and the enhancement of that. You'll get a better tip by your excellent service, not by trying to become my friend. This was my first time here and I think I was expecting better based on reviews. However, I will go back because I want to try it from a different angle by eating at the bar and choosing simpler items. Tune in later.

February 21, 2013|I had heard really great things|3|"I had heard really great things about Gracie's and looked forward to dining their with my co-worker when we were in Providence for business. Unfortunately our dining experience was ""marred"" by just too many things ""not going quite right."" They were out of the wine we ordered..and didn't make a recommendation for what might be a replacement, my entree was delivered cold and my friend received the rabbit even though she ordered the winter vegetable as her entree. I ended up eating mine alone...and hers arrived afterwords. These are little details but important parts of a restaurant being great. I am wondering if we received this treatment because we were just two women eating together late on a Thursday evening......"

February 21, 2013|Keeps Getting Better!|5|Every single time we eat at Gracie's we leaving thinking that was some of the best food we have ever eaten...I have eaten cauliflower soup a million times-but at Gracie's you literally take pause at how good this is...how flavorful each bite is...then dinner comes and you think it cannot taste as delicious as it looks-but it does...and then dessert is always the perfect note of sweet to end what is a pretty darn perfect meal.
February 16, 2013|A Perfect 10 Hot Spot!!!!|5|Amazing amazing customer service and wait staff! So friendly and knowledgable. Amazing food, every dish was perfect in taste, and presentation, and timing each meal. Drinks were fab! Yay! Love this place.... cheers....
February 15, 2013|Nice place but a bit pricey|3|Made a reservation and still had to wait about 20 minutes. An aplology from someone would have been nice. Once we were seated everything was fine though. The waitstaff were attentive and nice. The food was well prepared and thoughtful. It was expensive though, a little more than I thought it was worth. The ambiance could be better too. Although part of the problem is a strip club, not much they can do about that. Overall good but not great. I did not leave thinking about having to come back like I often do with places I love.
February 15, 2013|The best meal of my life.|5|The best meal of my life. I wanted to lick the plate clean after every course. Very reasonably priced for the quality. Service was impeccable as was the decor and food. I can't recommend this place enough!

February 15, 2013|Made the mistake of ordering|3|Made the mistake of ordering the chef choice pre fixe. Unfortunately, the chef's taste and mine did not match up. Next time will order from the menu. Also, most of the dishes were excessively salty, and I'm a salt user.
February 14, 2013|My husband and I have gone|3|My husband and I have gone to Gracie's for many special events--including valentine's day for several years running. Unfortunately, this time was a disappointment. I had requested the special booth which we have been lucky enough to get in years past. Instead we got a small table that is not usually there, but seemed to have been added for the night due to the large number of diners. This table was clearly in the line of the waiter's trajectory to the kitchen as there was constant brushing by us by the staff. It felt like being in the middle of a traffic pattern which we were disrupting--not the best ambiance for valentine's day AND it was ridiculously cold...we caught the draft from the open door somehow so I was cold the whole time.
February 14, 2013|Fantastic tasting menu, but|5|Fantastic tasting menu, but definitely expensive for the average dine. High quality ingredients and incredibly delicious combinations make one fantastically memorable meal that is worth the price.
February 13, 2013|Absolutely the best.|5|This is by far the best restaurant in Providence. While I would never diminish the role that the wonderful, creative, seasonally inspired menu plays in making this so, what puts it over the top is the outstanding service. The servers are considerate and thoughtful; they intuitively tailor the dining experience to your preferences, it seems. Every need you might have is already taken care of. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a really special experience.
February 7, 2013|When you want to do something|5|"When you want to do something incredibly special for someone, take them to Gracie's. The menu has choices that everyone loves and the presentation shows care and expertise. On this occasion we took a colleague out for dinner to celebrate her new job. Having told Gracie why we were coming, they provided us with a ""sparkling wine"" toast to celebrate -- compliments of the house. The small touches, the excellent service, and the ""Amazing Grace philosophy"" makes this a restaurant to visit over and over."

My friend and I were both so pleased with the meal and the atmosphere was classy and relaxing. The food was perfect and the service is over the top. Special requests made through opentable reservation were met making for an exceptional evening. Try Gracie's and you won't be disappointed!
February 2, 2013|It was our second visit.|5|It was our second visit. Gracies is now officially a new favorite restaurant. The food was outstanding, the service attentive without being overbearing. In addition to the food being deliciously prepared with local ingredients, the little touches between meals make it a treat to dine at Gracies. The menu is inventive. Kudos to the chef for making items I would normally shy away from (turnips in this case) delicious. I had the turnip soup as an appetizer just to test my theory. And voila...it was wonderful. We will be back!
February 2, 2013|The food at Gracie's is stellar.|5|The food at Gracie's is stellar. Whenever I dine there I always enjoy the seven-course chef's tasting. It is both creative and absolutely delicious. Everytime. It's my favorite restaurant in Rhode Island. My only complaint with Gracie's (and with many other restaurants) is that I ask for no dish to be served or prepared with any grapefruit. I, like 20% of Americans, take a statin to lower my cholesterol and grapefruit is taboo (in small doses it isn't harmful, but still you are not supposed to eat grapefruit while taking a statin). The last time I dined at Gracie's I was served a one-bite palette-cleanser that was made with grapefruit. Sadly, this is not unique to Gracie's. I believe dessert chefs generally are clueless about statins.

The food is divine, with each plate presenting a layered set of flavors so carefully planned to bring increased enjoyment with eat bite. I've ordered from the menu as well as done the tasting menu, and I have never been disappointed. In my experiences, the wine pairing lean towards the sweet side, but they always elevated the flavor of the food. If you are looking for a place to celebrate something special, this is the best place in Providence.

January 25, 2013|Practically perfect in every way|5|My new favorite restaurant. Tons of surprises that aren't in the menu play into the experience, including amuse bouche, palate cleansers, house made bread, and French macaroons... And the food and service are unbelievable. Order a la carte or the chefs tasting menu if you're adventurous. Never tasted something I didn't like here!
January 25, 2013|Fantastic and memorable experience!|5|We visited Gracie's during Restaurant Week and the prix fixe menu for RW was essentially a subset of their regular prix fixe menu. Not that this was a bad thing--while we were given the option of ordering from the regular (and higher priced) prix fixe menu, the RW menu had a very good sampling of items that appealed to us. The service was professional, but still friendly and warm. The little treats in between courses (breads, seasoned pork bites, grapefruit-ginger sorbet, pistachio meringues) were a nice touch. The beer and wine selections were great, and the pairings recommended with each dish on the menu were spot on. And the food--well, let's just say that even during RW, Gracie's culinary staff did NOT disappoint! We'll be back!
January 24, 2013|A must try and try again!|5|Ordered from the prefixe restaurant week menu. An outstanding value! We had the best salad, duck and bread pudding and all were succulent. We also ordered the ribeye which was cooked to perfection. Could have done without the bone marrow, however but that was on the side so an easy fix. The drinks are wonderfully unique but way overpriced. Will return for sure!
January 24, 2013|Have been hearing rave reviews/gush|5|Have been hearing rave reviews/gushings about the duck ever since I moved to Providence, and finally got the chance to indulge during restaurant week. It was the stuff of dreams. The desserts were also excellent banana bread pudding, chocolate cheesecake that was more like a dense fudge (in the best of ways) and a wonderfully executed creme brûlée -- couldn't go wrong. Especially 3 courses for $30. Oh, and the waitstaff was excellent -- friendly and attentive but gave us our space -- ideal service. Gracie's during Restaurant Week (or any week if you have the $$ to spare) is the ideal scenario.

We were seated promptly and provided both the regular and restaurant week menus and learned that all dishes on the restaurant week menu were 100% representative of the normal courses at Gracie's. Though our server was a little long in coming to the table the first time, once we got started the food delivery was prompt and timely, all of the food was fantastically plated and tasty and we had an overall great experience. The staff were all friendly, helpful and even provided subtle and appropriate humor. The environment was energetic with a lot of chatter going on and the crowd seemed young and into the foods and beverages they were drinking. Definitely will visit again!

I wish we lived closer to the resaurant to frequent it more often. Perfect little touches to make our dining experience that much more enjoyable (amuse, palate cleanser, cookies to go AND a thankyou letter mailed to home address for filling out a comment card)
January 24, 2013|Always superb. Quality is|5|Always superb. Quality is consistent, whether it is a set menu for a meeting in their event room, or a romantic dinner for two. Best restaurant in Providence, in my opinion.

January 24, 2013|Five stars is not enough.|5|One of if not the best place I have eaten in Providence. Great food, exceptional service, and pretty good value for your dollar as well. I'm excited to get back to Gracie's ASAP. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.
January 23, 2013|A Must for Anyone Near Providence|5|Amazing restaurant, if you couldn't tell already by other reviews. This place lives up to the hype and then some (though the drinks were a bit expensive). If you live near Providence, Gracie's is a must.
January 23, 2013|This surpassed our expectations!|5|This surpassed our expectations! The food was delicious, the service impeccable and they were extremelly accommodating with dietary restrictions. We will definitely go back.

January 22, 2013|There's a reason why Gracie's|5|There's a reason why Gracie's is the top restaurant of myself and anyone I know who's had the pleasure of dining here. The food is outstanding, the cocktails are unique and inspired, and the staff really goes out of their way to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. This most recent dinner was for restaurant week, but I try to come here for any occasion when I'm in the area. If you want to impress a significant other or have a wonderful dining experience, I highly recommend Gracie's.
January 19, 2013|Great, amazing, wonderful!|5|Great, amazing, wonderful! Better than any restaurant in downtown Boston and they dont rush you out on a Saturday night as they tend to in downtown Boston!
January 19, 2013|A little noisy but the service|5|A little noisy but the service was impeccable & the food delicious
January 19, 2013|There is such a great variety|5|There is such a great variety on Gracie's menu that it is a new experience ever time I go there! The chefs are incredibly creative and always find new ways to incorporate interesting ingredients into each of the dishes. The restaurant is very well staffed and everyone is very attentive; you can barely finish a glass of water before it is refilled for you. Between each course, they give you a little taste of something special that the chef has put together. For dessert the creme brulee is rich and decadent, and the french macaroons are airy and delicious. A night out at Gracie's can be pricey, but the quality of the food and the service is well worth the cost.
January 18, 2013|By far one of THE BEST restaurants|5|By far one of THE BEST restaurants in Providence. Food was AMAZING and our waiter was superb, as well as all the other waitstaff. Good sense of humor. We had reservations but needed to wait 15min when we arrived, however, a glass of wine from the bar was pleasant. Really wonderful place for special occasions. Definitely would recommend.
January 18, 2013|Consistently wonderful!|5|I've now been to Gracie's three times and each meal has been lovely. The food is delicious, the ambiance is just the right amount of noise (clinking glasses and chatter): enough to make you feel like you're OUT, but not so much that you can carry on a conversations with someone who mumbles. The staff is so friendly. Just the perfect place to go for a nice dinner!
January 18, 2013|We had a great experience|5|We had a great experience here! The food was amazing and the bread was equally fantastic. They brought out tastings from the kitchen that were fabulous. The wait staff was awesome, they were friendly and personable. Would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in town. To give reference, I spent 4 yrs in manhattan and this was very high up on my list.
January 18, 2013|We went during restaurant|5|We went during restaurant week to try it out. We loved it. The food was superb, the wait staff helpful, and attentive to needs, and the ambiance was lovely. We will definitely be going back.
January 17, 2013|Was there for restaurant week.|5|Was there for restaurant week. Had a beet and fig salad and a turnip soup for apps, perfectly cooked duck breast for entrees, and creme brulee for dessert - all wonderful. With a glass of pinot noir the damage was $77 - can't beat that. Enjoyed the amuse bouches between courses as well. Will be back again.

I also happen to have food allergies and did speak with them the day before. When I arrived and informed my server she told me they met earlier with the chef and will ready to accommodate me. Wow, and they did! The food was the best I have had in many years. Great experience and will definitely be back.

January 15, 2013|Five Star Dining Experience!|5|My wife and I went to Gracie's to celebrate my 69th birthday on January 15th. We were fortunate that our visit coincided with Providence's restaurant week. We made our reservation online and it worked perfectly. We even received a call in the late morning to confirm our reservation. The service, the three course dinner and the entire dining experience was simply five star! We had the roasted beets for our first course which was excellent and artfully presented. We both ordered the roasted duck which was superb and perfectly done. We ordered two desserts, a sumptuous creme brûlée and chocolate cheesecake both of which were memorable and to die for! All told, it was simply a wonderful dining experience!

January 8, 2013|The food and wine selections|5|The food and wine selections are the reasons to go to Gracie's, but their service is also unparalelled. Professional, friendly but unobtrusive - a change from the overly familiar trend of even high-end restaurants these days. Sitting at the bar is no less excellent an experience; in fact, I prefer it there.
December 31, 2012|Gracies on New Years|3|Opted for the the 7 course meal, the first 5 courses were great and then the server disappeared. I find more fault with management, who did not seem to have a clue that the end of our experience was crashing and burning. They did not have on enough help to make the dining experience 5 star. Too bad, I use to like the place.

December 29, 2012|This restaurant was recommended|5|This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend who is a chef. The food was delicious and very inventive. Service was excellent and atmoshere was very relaxing.
December 28, 2012|We'll definitely be back|5|We went to Gracie's based on a friend's recommendation, and were not disappointed. The service was relaxed and professional but not intrusive. The food was delicious and satisfying, without being gimmicky or flashy. I think it says a lot about Gracie's that, over desserts and coffee, we were already taking about coming back.
December 28, 2012|First let me say that the|3|"First let me say that the service was good, friendly and fairly attentive. We were greeted upon arrival and everyone had a smile and seemed happy to be serving us. My wife ordered the three course price fix, though almost every item came with an additional charge making me question the ""price fix"". The food was good, not great. We each had the poached egg with tongue, which was good but could have benefited from more tongue and a bit more flavor - perhaps a bit of truffle would have made this good dish great. The striped bass my wife had was decent but nothing special. I chose to have the sweetbreads as an entre, though a larger portion was not offered despite this being a starter dish. Again, this was decent but not memorable."
December 22, 2012|Everything was terrific:|5|Everything was terrific: the bar, the food, the service. The bartender was terrific. The service at our table was outstanding....all the 'little touches' didn't go unnoticed. Our party of 4 ordered from the menu and were very happy with our choices.

December 15, 2012|A place not to miss|5|We travel to Providence several times per year and always set aside time to take in a few of the city's best restaurants. We are vegetarians which always complicates things. But there is a vegetable plate on the menu -- which my wife had and was spectacular -- and a willingness by the waitstaff and kitchen to work through other options. The salads were amazing, in particular the beet salad which was creative and well-composed. The chocolate porter cake was a knock-out although more reminiscent of a gingerbread than anything else. The wine list was solid. Our waiter was exceptional as were the all the waitstaff.

Dined on December 15, 2012|One of the nicest experiences|5|One of the nicest experiences we've had at any restaurant. Not only was every bit of food delicious, but the service was excellent. Our 3-course prix fixe menu was prepared and served efficiently [yet not hurried] so that we had ample time to get to the PPAC, and the valet parking was very convenient. But the little touches put the experience over the top, the amuse bouche to start and the sorbet served between courses, the wonderful homemade breads, the tasty cookie treat to go, and then, discovering the next day in our car some more cookie treats left by the valet!

Just the perfect amount of food and it added so much excitement to not know the menu and be surprised with every course. The staff were excellent. I've been to many restaurants. I am 55 years old. This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a public review.
December 8, 2012|Don't waste your time or money|3|Don't waste your time or money on the tasting! Just order off of the menu. Better value and better food.

That's right! We were rushed to get to the theater so Gracie's held our bill and car that was valet parked at no cost. After the theater, we returned for a slow dessert, to pay our bill and retrieve the car. And yes, chocolate cookies were waiting for us in the console for the ride home!
December 8, 2012|Exquisite food - wonderful service|5|The food and service are amazing. If you like fabulous ingredients prepared flawlessly come here! Expensive - but not overpriced - excellent value.

The staff paid good attention to our gluten-free request and also kept our theatre start time in mind while scheduling the roll out of the meal.

December 1, 2012|service needs fine tuning|4|Gracie's has become the new favorite for my wife and I. The food is always fantastic and very interesting. The flavors are layered and simply presented. We went for my birthday and I felt the service was rushed and somewhat unpolished. This is the third time I have been to Gracie's, (once for our wedding anniversary and on the other occasion I had some guests in from the UK), and on the last two occasions the service has been remarkable for its lack of polish from the waitstaff. The service has been either too apathetic or too hurried. This is the kind of restaurant where you want to just relax and the servers need to be more in tune with their guests.
December 1, 2012|Great food (5 course) but|4|Great food (5 course) but we did leave feeling like we wanted a big crunchy salad post dinner. Shame after spending $200+ for two. A little bit on a foo-foo side for us even though everything we had was delicious.. We want a little less foo and and more food.

November 23, 2012|Fantastic|5|We celebrated my girlfriend's 25th birthday at Gracie's. It was our first time there and didn't know what to expect. Our dining experience couldn't have been more enjoyable. The atmosphere was relaxing yet elegant, the service was fantastic, and the food was amazing. In between courses, fresh bread and palate cleansers were distributed. The bar was well-stocked and offered a large variety of beverages, all ranging in price. The restaurant's valet service was convenient and left complimentary cookies in our vehicle. Overall, the night was very relaxing and enjoyable.
November 23, 2012|Spectacular|5|"We went to Gracie's with another couple for a 40th Birthday celebration. The host made a big deal with glitter on the table, complimentary champagne toast and a candle in the desert. Very fun and classy. The service was the best. We had two servers, they got us every thing we needed, without bothering us. Quite an accomplishment. I don't have words for how good the food is. You must order the 3 course meal. I almost skipped our on the appetizer and it was just about the best thing I've ever eaten. The four or us each ordered the 3 course prefix with different items. I tried a bit of everything and it was all ""punch-you-in-the-face"" delicious. I highly recommend Gracie's for a special night out. It is well worth the cost."
November 17, 2012|Great Job|5|Good service, good food and good Ambiance. Great job! I wish they would sell the passion fruit sorbet at the store. I would buy gallons of it.
November 10, 2012|Very disappointing. I've|3|Very disappointing. I've had excellent meals at Gracie's but this was average. We had a 5-course paired tasting and neither the food or the pairings were remarkable. Some were good but not what you'd expect-and what I've had before at Gracie's.
November 10, 2012|Birthday Celebration|5|This was our first visit. When making the reservation, I noted that one of our party was celebrating a birthday. Upon arrival, we were seated at a table decorated with silver glitter stars and a card with a birthday greeting. We were also offered champagne on the house! We all ordered Prix Fixe meals--a great idea (3 courses--mix and match--with a minimum price plus modest up charges for the more expensive entrees). Two of us had scallops (good), one had cod (great) and one had chicken (outstanding). The corn potage (soup) with lobster was excellent as was the creme brûlée dessert. We were offered wine pairings chosen by the bartender--great idea and choices! The service was excellent as was the free valet parking. We will be back!

November 10, 2012|Our meal this weekend was|5|"Our meal this weekend was ""fab"" as usual. Gracie's is our ""go-to"" special occasion restaurant in Providence, where our daughter lives. We arrived at our table to find silver confetti stars (a Gracie's motif), and a whimsical quote on the table. Just after being seated, the hostess asked who the birthday celebrant was, wished her well, and called for a complimentary (small but lovely) pour of champagne for all of us. As the meal proceeded, we enjoyed Gracie's usual excellent service and delicious food. We usually choose the ""prix fixe"" menu, and upgrade as necessary, and it's always a hard choice about what to choose. The birthday girl's dessert came adorned with a sparkling birthday candle. We love Gracie's!!!"

November 3, 2012|We went for a special birthday,|4|We went for a special birthday, and there was glitter on our table, complimentary tastes of champagne, birthday wishes, and more; very nice touches. Our food was uniformly very good (with the exception of desserts). The service was lovely -- attentive, unobtrusive, very pleasant. Gracie's provides little extra tastes between courses, which are very nice. The bar service was lacking; we waited a very long time for our drinks before dinner, and one of the 2 drinks was not what was ordered and had to be sent back; also the bar did not have Stoli or B&B for an after-dinner drink. Neverthless, despite the drink and dessert issues, our experinece overall was very good and we'd go back for another special occasion
November 1, 2012|Food, service, ambiance were|5|Food, service, ambiance were all amazing. The $40 prix fixe is a fantastic value. Particularly liked sitting in the lounge area which is more low key and romantic than the main dining area. One of the best restaurants in Providence, which has a lot of great restaurants!
October 31, 2012|My favorite Restaurant in Downtown|5|Plain and Simple--My favorite downtown restaurant! The staff from the Hostess to the Bartender, to the Servers better than The Best!!! They always make such a big deal about each patron.... It was my birthday...I could be the entire staffs Mother or Granny but they make you feel like we are all counterparts...professional and full of service but warm and welcoming.... This restaurant is all about US the person coming to Gracie's-all about the service for US--all about making your food or drink as you like it-so it is all about US... So another great experience at Gracie's!
October 30, 2012|Jimbo|5|I took my girlfriend there for our anniversary and it lived up to the billing as one the best restaurants in Providence. The food was was definitely different as far as menu items but, it was terrific (esp the farm fresh egg w/ oxtail ragout) and the staff/service was impeccable. It was a wonderful experience and one that I would recommend to anyone.
October 27, 2012|Absolutely amazing dinner.|5|Absolutely amazing dinner. The manager Megan was kind enough to seat us in the private alcove booth for two because it was our anniversary. The service, food, drinks were all exceptional. We are so fortunate to have Gracies in RI. We love that the chef takes great care in using locally sourced and organic products whenever possible. I was fortunate enough to try the market fish for the day which was Tautog. It was the first time I had this sweet and delicate fish and it was delicious. I look forward to my next dinner at Gracies.

October 10, 2012|Great food and wine selection|4|The food at Gracie's is amazing and so is their wine list. I took our UK CEO and his boss, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, for dinner and they were thrilled with the food and overall experience. Our Chairman owns a vineyard in South Africa and was amazed at the great wine selection and he chose a Au Bon Climat Chardonnay which was outstanding. My only complaint was that our server was a little slow and not very friendly. The support staff were great except when dessert arrived they switched my plate with the Chairman's and he had already taken a bite and was thoroughly enjoying it so I didn't want to spoil the moment and let the situation alone. His choice was really good but the Chocolate Marquis that ordered looked better!
October 6, 2012|"""...we treasured in deliciousness"""|5|"Following our first visit I believe that I had compared this restaurant to a very special place in Napa: FARM. Gracie's is equal to the best-of-the-best. Entrusting our party of four to the whims of the chef we treasured in deliciousness. Truly, truly spectacular was the 5-course tasting menu; an experience, not a ""meal"". By choosing tastings you place yourself in the hands of someone unknown. What will come? Will it be good? These questions need not be asked at Gracie's. From bread to delicate starters, and a gnocchi dish - almost a stew - so delightful, causing chins to drop in confusion; can food be this good? Dessert so special in form and taste. Service designed for royals. Jonathan Edwards Syrah went oh-so-well with all. Thank you!"
October 6, 2012|Our meals were wonderful and|4|Our meals were wonderful and the service was very good after they realized we were seated...somehow, the waiter was not initially told by the hostess we were assigned to him so it took a while for anyone to acknowledge our presence. We have been to Gracie's many times and have never been disappointed. It is an excellent choice for those folks that plan to attend the theater across the street!
October 6, 2012|A wonderful night out!|5|We had a wonderful experience at Gracie's. Our server, Dennis, was knowledgeable with both wine and food. When we were seated we were asked if we had a time constraint (we had theater tickets for Trinity Rep. - right across the street). The restaurant worked to make sure we were out in time for the show, but never did we feel rushed. A bonus: complimentary valet service that also allows you to leave your car with them while you attend the theater.
October 6, 2012|Amazing food, great service|5|Amazing food, great service and reasonable prices considering the atmosphere and caliber of food. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
October 6, 2012|Gracie's is a wonderful restaurant-|5|Gracie's is a wonderful restaurant-the food is creative, beautifully prepared and presented, and delicious. The service is absolutely first rate--well trained and attentive staff who do not hover or intrude but are attuned to every detail-not an easy balance. It's right across the street from Trinity Rep in downtown Providence and our first choice for dinner when we are going to a play.
October 5, 2012|Prix fixe menu included nice|3|Prix fixe menu included nice variety of interesting choices, some carrying extra pricetag. Chef places premium on fresh food and striking presentation--and delivered. The appetizers (minimalist seafood soup with tasty but lonely lobster lumps; abstract expression of lamb mousse) were a little too precious. Entrees (in our case beef and fish) were solid. Undeniably fabulous desserts. For some, the rich taste of butter and salt infusing all dishes might be a turn on; for us, not. Staff were friendly and reasonably attentive. The final price for two, with 1/2 bottle of wine and tip was over $200. Glad we tried it; would not go back except for a drink at the bar or a one-course meal.

Excellent wine menu with a good number of wines available by the glass. Service was excellent and unobtrusive. My wait person asked if I had a time constraint; answer was yes to theater tickets, so special attention was paid to getting service on time. Tables well spaced, and lovely background music. I will definitely return. This was a wonderful dinning experience.

September 22, 2012|Best Meal In Providence|5|We have eaten at most of the restaurants in town, and Gracie's was, without question, the best meal we've had. Absolutely great. On par with any restaurant in New York or San Francisco. Highly recommend.
September 22, 2012|This is a great restaurant|5|This is a great restaurant right across the street from Trinity Rep, so perfect for an evening out with dinner and a play, if you can get a table. After 4 tries I finally got in. It was worth the wait--almost perfect.
September 21, 2012|We got the 7 course tasting|4|We got the 7 course tasting menu and each course was great. The servers each took turns explaining what the courses were and the wine pairings were fantastic.
September 21, 2012|Gracie's is near the Johnson|5|Gracie's is near the Johnson and Wales campus and I believe they are taking advantage of the proximity to cutting edge culinary stars. The food is fabulous from kicky amuse bouches to sherry and olive oil cake. Service is perfect... not intrusive but solicitous. They greeted us with a lovely taste of cava and reserved us a cozy corner table for our anniversary dinner. Highly recommend.

September 18, 2012|Can't Go Wrong Eating here!|5|The meal was lovely. We did the five course tasting and I highly recommend it or the larger seven course offering. It's a little pricey, but well worth the expense since it's all stuff that's chosen specifically by the Chef and varies each night based on what's avaiailable, in season, or on the Chef's mind. The servers at Gracie are excellent, and it's just a really great little place. Went for a birthday dinner with my folks, and it was a top shelf experience all the way. Will be back again, and again.

September 7, 2012|Great place for a nice dinner.|5|Great place for a nice dinner. Price is reasonable for the quality of food you get. Portions are conservative, but not small. Service is pretty good. The noise level is low, because they don't have music playing, which creates a nice atmosphere. Highly recommend.
September 6, 2012|Wonderful food. Gnocchi and|4|Wonderful food. Gnocchi and mussels to start were both very good, as was scallops entre. Manhattan cocktail from local Rhode Island producer was special. Only rated service as good since our server seemed not very patient or warm, given we had two young, but very well behaved children with us. Similarly cool to my mother who needed time to figure out the menu system. In sharp contrast, the woman helping our server, Grace, was exceptional. Knowledgeable, patient, and upbeat. So, a mixed bag on service. Ambience lovely, with warm interior touches. Our banquette seating was comfortable and cozy. Lighting was low, but appropriate for the meal, though I would suggest small flashlights for those who need it when reading the menu

September 1, 2012|You can never go wrong here|5|Still one of the best places in Providence to get a meal. I cannot say enough about everything at this restaurant. We have dined here dozens of times of the last few years, and have never had anything less than a stellar experience.
August 31, 2012|This is one of our favorite|4|This is one of our favorite places. Maybe it was just a full moon, but their service was a bit off on our last visit. However the food was still excellent and the servers tried to be accommodating and were extremely nice. Just not as good as usual.
August 31, 2012|Great food. I like the Salad|3|Great food. I like the Salad and the fruit tart. Also they have 4 different types of bread you can choose from. I personally like the food here better than Local 121.
August 31, 2012|Our second trip to Gracie's,|5|Our second trip to Gracie's, and the food was even better than the first time, truly the best we've had in Providence. Our only complaint was that our table was quite dark, and made it difficult to see the food, which was a bit of a shame, because the presentations were beautiful. We'll definitely go back, but will ask for a table with a bit more light.
August 30, 2012|I spent two weeks in Providence|4|I spent two weeks in Providence and this was the best restaurant at which I ate. Quality new-American cuisine - dishes around the table were consistent and pleasing.

August 29, 2012|I love Gracie's in Providence|5|OK, while I generally dine in and around Boston, this is a winner, worth the drive to Providence which for me is nearly as close as Boston. Our friends from Boston loved our recent early dinner with us, as we had tickets to Jersey Boys at the nearby PPAC, a short walk in fact, so only parked once. Gracie's is fabulous, from the various homemade breads, to the complimentary 'amuse bouche' to the amazing sea food and the desserts that we had to have. For $40 there's a 3-course menu which is glorious, so I took pix of my food! Five and seven courses are options. Service impeccable. Gracie's rules at the top of my OpenTable dining list.
August 25, 2012|food was great,different.|5|food was great,different. service was wonderful Natalia & ? was our servers. great job. Not alot of food, But the chef kept sending out treats. valet was also great, out car was pulled up waiting for us even before we finished our meal.Highly recommended. Will be back.Really the meaning of fine dining.
August 24, 2012|Upon arriving we were quickly|4|Upon arriving we were quickly and cordially seated, and were given water. We then waited for close to ten minutes for our waitress to come over and ask if we wanted anything to drink and to discuss the menu. This kind of ruined the experience. Unfortunately, This was a re-occurring theme, her being absent most of the evening, and when present not very personable. Luckily for the service of the bread/water server (who looked like Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who was very personable, and the other staff, the service would have gotten a lower score. The food was extremely well prepared and delicious. There were a few palate cleansers or mini courses, that were brought out which were nice little surprises, and nice little touches.
August 24, 2012|The Gold Standard of Service|5|The de facto standard in Providence when it comes to service. The best wait staff in the city. Very attentive to detail and very easy to talk to. Food is always great. Can't go wrong here, especially for romantic nights out.
August 24, 2012|Absolutely one of the best|5|Absolutely one of the best restaurants we have ever encountered! The food was amazing, the atmosphere was vibrant but still Cody and the service was attentive but not hovering. There were so many nice touched, from the quote on the first page of the menu to the melt in your mouth macaroons that were served with the bill. Truly a delightful experience.

August 22, 2012|Quality Dining Experience|5|"I ate alone at Gracie's on a business trip, and I'm so glad I did. It's a more expensive restaurant than I typically patronize, and the quality of food and the service made it a memorable experience. I chose the 3 course prixe-fixe and I was very pleased with my food, plus the ""treats"" that the chef sent out in-between courses. The service was spectacular and everyone was incredibly friendly. I will return again, and I can't wait for my husband to join me on a business trip so we can enjoy it together."
August 18, 2012|True Perfection|5|My wife and I found Gracies at a restaurant week last year and were both eager to go back! We chose Gracies as our last summer hoorah. Being teachers we spent all summer with our children entertaining them and this night was to be just ours! It was spectacular. We chose the 5 course, should have gone seven!,chef tasting menu with wine pairings. We never wanted it to end. Each portion left us breathless and giddy for the next. Plate presentation and the clean flavors were all truly inspired works. I have been a chef and restaurant owner for 20 years...Gracies is truly a secret on the east coast. Your service staff is so professional and the kitchen staff are true craftsmen. Thanks so much for another unbelievable dining experience.
August 16, 2012|My wife and I wanted a nice|5|My wife and I wanted a nice place to go for dinner while on vacation in RI. We were not disappointed; the atmosphere is romantic and relaxed. The staff was friendly, efficient, and worked as a team. We had the 5 course chef's selection along with the wine pairing and it was excellant. The wines were mached with the course perfectly. The valet parking attendent was great and gave us cookies for the ride home.
August 15, 2012|Go for the food not the sevice!|4|Food was fantastic. Every part of what we ate is why will come back. Service was so so. Started with them not having enough menus then bringing the wrong glass of wine for my wife. They didn't bring the bread till me asked for it. At the end of the night we had some Espressos and tea. These were brought 1 by 1 over a 10 minute period!

Sparkles on the table with a ""love"" note, glasses of prosecco and good wishes from the staff. We decided to have the five course chef's tasting menu and were not disappointed.

August 2, 2012|Amylsimmons2001|5|"My husband and I were in town for the night and we found Gracie's in our search. What luck! We were celebrating our recent home purchase and had the three course prefixe. I started with the Rainier cherry salad and my husband had the poached egg on toast. Yum! Then we had more yummy homemade bread that tided us over for our duck, which was plentiful and perfectly cooked and bass, which was lovely on potato purée and so well done! The drinks we ordered were top notch libations besting those we had earlier at the Dorrance and the bottle of Italian red was reasonable. Our desserts were also amazing! He had the apricot and ricotta shortbread and I had the dark chocolate cake with basil ""ice cream"" (made from avocados)! Excellent meal!!"

We did the tasting menu which was incredible and really fun. Very filling! Our servers were excellent. They knew what they were talking about but were fun too. I always recommend Gracie's!
July 27, 2012|We have eaten here twice now-|4|We have eaten here twice now- the food is amazing. You can order individual items but they also have multiple different tasting menu options depending on your time and budget constraints. The menu changes frequently so there's always something different. The ingredients are very fresh- some grown in their rooftop garden (a feat for being right downtown). The waiters are attentive but the meal can be slow (long time between courses) and the tables are a little bit too crowded together. They have a great pastry chef, so the bread and dessert options are always great. The valet even leaves a fresh/warm chocolate chip cookie for you in your car. If you're not in a hurry, highly recommended!

July 24, 2012|Definitely Returning|5|"Though we were twenty minutes early for our reso, we were seated promptly. We were served on a timely schedule and also asked if there were any allergies at the table that should be noted. Before the appetizers came, the table was served a round of amuse bouches (carrot juice shot - good, needed a little salt that was noticeably absent from the table). My appetizer (the gnocchi) was amazing! Just the right amount of gnocchi so that I wasn't full for dinner. After the appetizers, we were served a palette cleanser (cherry/lemon sorbet) that was delicious and refreshing. My entree was the striped bass (perfectly cooked) with a tomato salad and ""garlic fondue"" (also, amazing). Creme brulee capped off the meal and was perfectly cooked."
July 21, 2012|Wonderful. Excellent food.|5|Wonderful. Excellent food. Chef provides lots of great surprises.
July 20, 2012|Horrible Service|3|"I went here during restaurant week. The food was excellent but the whole experience was clouded by the poor service we received. When we first arrived, we waited 20 minutes for water; slow, but this didn't really bother us as we were enjoying chatting. After the servers ""helper"" brought us water, another 15 minutes went by before our server took our drink order. It took another 15 minutes for my glass of wine to show up. Finally, we ordered and it took nearly 40 minutes for our appetizers to arrive (the waiter did come and apologize for the wait and offer ""something special"" after the meal). After long waits for every course, an empty wine glass-lost sale-and no coffee offered, we got the check without any special treat or even a kind word."
July 20, 2012|A labor of love|4|Another unexpected hit. You get the feeling that Gracie's is a labor of love. Personal touches shine through in the decor, service, menu, and ambience. How can you not feel like you're being let into the chef's inner-circle, a select group of foodies and Providence elite, when your waitress sends out the first of your meal's many unexpected amuse-bouche? Or when she recommends a special that seems whipped into existence from some mad dream, based on this-morning's available produce? The answer, of course, is that you can't. Gracie's is worth it for the food alone, but the entire experience is singularly inviting and too good to miss.
July 20, 2012|Heavenly dining...|5|wow! what a fabulous restaurant! our party of four each had a diah that was beautifully prepared and presented. what a pleasure to be served in such a professional envirornment. the breads alone are worth the trip into town!
July 19, 2012|Gracie's is always excellent,|4|"Gracie's is always excellent, but I particularly enjoy them during restaurant week because...I can't afford them the rest of the time, ha! Actually, their three-course tasting menu is only 35 dollars, but the food is so good, you'll want to splurge on the 5 or 7 course! I put ""romantic"" in my review because it would be nice for a date-night - though they do pack people in (so maybe not a date night you want to be super duper private). Really really great restaurant!"

July 18, 2012|I was really disappointed|3|"I was really disappointed with Gracie's. The staff won't leave you alone, the waiters are prententious and the food is okay. We did the tasting menu (after being assured it will be customized to our eating preferances) and the chef insisted on serving food you've asked him not to. After sending back a course- the chef actually redid it, and sent the same course back to me. The waiter explained it as ""The chef just wants you to eat."" I've never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant in my life. I felt like a 5 yr being forced to eat something that I didn't want to eat. Did I mention we paid $75/person for this experience? I just can't support a restaurant where the chef's ego is more important than a customer's happiness."
July 18, 2012|A true dinning experience,|5|A true dinning experience, amazing flavor in every dish and a knowledgeable professional wait staff with a personality! In fact our server Dennis(?)chose my entire meal and I could not have been happier with his selection. All in all a wonderful introduction this gem of a restaurant. PS The GREATEST gluten-free dessert ever!
July 18, 2012|It was a great experience|3|It was a great experience BUT two of the waitstaff dropped their dishes serving others which raised our eyebrows.

Dined on July 17, 2012|So Many Pluses But Tiny Portions|4|We ate here last night. We loved everything about Gracie's except the portions/pricing. A single confit duck leg for $28?? with one quartered baby turnip, 1/2 ounce of cubed roasted peach and 2 little onions(no starch)??? $10 Rainier cherry salad had THREE cherries, 2 wisps of greens.Honest. We both had 3 courses but when we left, we knew we would be hungry again in a short time, and we were.We eat out often in comparable restaurants, mostly in Boston,and I can't say we've had this drastic a small portions experience before. But we won't support this overpricing again. Too bad because the room, service and food are very appealing.

The unexpected treats that they give you in between each course and even leave for you in your car when you valet were divine and super special touch. The wait staff was extremely attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and pleasant. I would without a doubt go back as this restaurant is now on my top 5 list for Providence.

Having been there twice before, it's a fabulous restaurant with the most creative, delicious and lovely food. The service was outstanding as was the wine, variety of freshly baked breads and several complimentary offerings as ""amuse bouche"" and palate-cleansing lime/basil sorbet. At Restaursnt Week price it was too good to be true. The best news is that patrons may dine on a regular basis at $35 for an elegant three- course dinner or upgrade to five-course menu My husband's duck leg was fantastic, as was my fish entree. A dessert of apricots, ricotta, sweet corn ice cream and a shortbread was amazing. Truly a special Providence treasure!"

My 3 courses were all very good;gnocchi, seared duck (small portion) and grilled apricots with sweet corn ice cream, but my wife did not care for her tough, under seasoned striped bass. Her salad with blue cheese and semifreddo dessert were both very good. My problem is the lighting which, is much too low. Very hard to read the wine list and menu, or to see the food presentation. Service was good, not great. Bottle of wine arrived after first course was served, and we were asked to order our dessert when we ordered our first and second courses of a prix fixe menu. This allowed them to control the pace of the meal too much and I felt a bit rushed at the en

June 30, 2012|Great food, mediocre service|3|The food at Gracie's is absolutely fantastic, highly creative, and beautiful. However, we had a major issue with the service there. We sat down at about 7:40, were promptly greeted by a string of servers (to the point where it was a little overwhelming), and then nobody was anywhere to be seen for the next 25 minutes. We had no bread, just water. We ordered the 5-course tasting menu (again, fabulous), but the delivery of dishes came irregularly with a few very long waits and sheepish apologies. There were several silverware issues too (forgetting to give us new sets, then taking away clean sets only to replace with another clean set, etc). We are not hard to please, but we found the lack of communication frustrating.
June 30, 2012|Awesome!|5|By far, the absolute best meal I've had in a very long time. Wonderful flavors, cooked to perfection, and artistically presented.
June 29, 2012|Gracie's was an amazing experience|5|Gracie's was an amazing experience from the small details to the ambience and food. This was a birthday celebration and they made it a special occasion from the initial greeting, the card on the table, the sparkling wine and then to the dessert with a candle. The tuna appetizer, the bass entree, and the chocolate silk torte were outstanding. We had theater tickets and weren't going to have time for our dessert, but they were accomodating in holding our dessert until after the show. Their attention to fine details were outstanding which included the cookies left in the car by the valet. I can't wait to go back.

Paul, our waiter, was very attentive and efficient. The food is truly outstanding and beautifully presented. Our only quibble is with the wine list which is expensive, so we brought our own special bottle and paid the $25 corkage fee. The final touch was two chocolate chip cookies waiting for us in the car. If you are looking for a romantic experience and fabulous food, look no further!

It has a nice star themed atmosphere with tables well spaced for moderately quiet, private conversations, and the waiters were very nice and polite. However, after ordering we had to wait for our meal for a long time,and the food was average, even expensive, for its price. We went for our mother's birthday and they did provide complimentary sparkling wine and decorated the table by sprinkling some stars, which was very nice. All in all it was a good restaurant, but I would not say ""I have to go back""."

After touring the town for five hours we arrived at Gracie's and we greeted warmly. Our special table, complete with glitter, a champagne toast and a special card, was excellent. The service, once we demonstarted more than a casual interest in food, was spotless. The prix fixe dinner option is an outstanding value. The menu is unique and filled with really delicious offerings.I had the rigatoni and sausage entre and my wife had the chicken ballotine. Both were outstanding. It is hard to believe that Providence has any restaurant better than Gracie's.

However, Gracie's was so fantastic that I would drive the hour to Providence for dinner without a thought. What a special place. Our waitperson, Kevin, was very well informed and checked on us often!
June 23, 2012|Coming from MA, I booked this|3|Coming from MA, I booked this restaurant a week before to take a friend of mine who was visiting. At 4pm the day of, they called me to confirm my reservation. On arrival, there was no clear sign at the door like most other restaurants in the area that did for valet, so I parked in the Central Parking opposite for something around $20. Upon arrival, neither of us were offered for our coats to be taken. Service was terrible, we even had not 1 but 2 servers waiting on us. In whole, the whole meal was over 3, almost 4 hours long from stepping in through the door. Gracie's generally held up to their reputation for food, although some dishes were a little too salty. After, I was confused as to the dress code, several people were wearing sho
June 23, 2012|A True Dining Experience|5|My Husband and I went to Gracie's this past weekend and were thrilled! I had read good reviews so I took the chance of making reservations. We are in the restaurant business so sometimes the expectations are high and they were from what I read! The food was fabulous. The service was impeccable. It is so refreshing to go to a restaurant and have a dining experience with a well trained knowledgeable staff. So the food... all I can say is bravo! We decided to do the five course blind tasting and wine pairing. One course after the next was delicious!The pairings were also very well chosen.
June 23, 2012|One tip about Gracie's|5|Like so many diners here, we rate Gracie's as one of our most enjoyable and memorable meals ever. Just one tip that I don't see in the other reviews: For the three-course menu, you can just tell the kitchen to choose what to serve. They'll ask about any dislikes and allergies, and then you're in their hands. This made the experience even more special.

June 9, 2012|Gracie's is always a new dining|5|Gracie's is always a new dining experience. The menu is varied and changes...the food is always very good. Perfect location if you are attending the Trinity Rep theater which is across the street or attending a performance at the PPAC which is about 3 blocks away. Valet your car for the evening and then have an after show cocktail in the bar at Gracie's. Have a wonderful evening!
June 9, 2012|We had a really wonderful|4|We had a really wonderful dinner and the service was superb. We ordered the 5 course tasting with the wine tasting. Once the 20% tip was added, however, the bill came to $300. While the food and experience were very excellent, we didn't think it met the price point.

June 7, 2012|This was a wonderful experience|5|This was a wonderful experience and probably the best meal I've every had (or at least right up there). I highly recommend the 5 or 7 course experience.
June 2, 2012|Foodie Haven in Providence|5|We ate at Gracie's for our daughter's graduation dinner. The food and atmosphere were perfect for the occasion. The $35 price fixe menu is a real bargain, even with some of the up charges for appetizer and entree items. The food was excellent, perfectly prepared and artfully presented. The service was also outstanding with our server making sure there were no food allergies or special considerations. The bread, baked on site, was a strong start to the meal (get the honey wheat!) and each course built on that start. My only regret is that this was our first (and last) visit to Gracie's given that our daughter graduated from RISD and we will not be back in Providence.
June 2, 2012|Love food?, you'll love Gracies|5|What can you say about Gracie's? Let's start with probably the best chef in Providence who's food is exquisite, an efficient, friendly wait staff that is there with complete knowledge of everything on the menu and ready to offer you anything that fits your dining taste, to the incredible presentation and taste of your meal. Whether you are there for the pix fixe three course dinner of one of the mind blowing 5 or 7 course tasting menus, you will never leave Gracie's disappointed. Gracie's is truly one of Providences crowning achievements.
June 1, 2012|Have never been disappointed|5|Have never been disappointed in the dining experience! We have been going regularly for 6+ years and will continue to enjoy the dining experience.
June 1, 2012|We took our daughter here|5|We took our daughter here during graduation week at RISD. We all agree it was one of the best meals we had ever eaten.

Before we ordered they brought champagne to our table, because they knew we were celebrating a birthday and anniversary. What a nice touch! The food was excellent. I had the Foie Gras, and then the Duck; the blending of flavors was wonderful. Dessert was not as good as the rest of the meal, but did not disappoint. The wait staff was just terrific. I would definitely go back!

The staff made a special occasion (my daughter's graduation, and her friend's birthday) even more special by bringing their desserts decorated with candles to blow out. We love Gracie's and cant wait to come back!
May 17, 2012|We had a truly excellent meal|5|We had a truly excellent meal at Gracie's the other night - the fois gras was fantastic, as was the egg and bacon appetizer and the scallop dish. We split on the chicken ballontine main course - my husband liked it but I didn't because it was filled with dark meat. Overall, though, I would highly recommend the restaurant and would definitely go back again.

May 15, 2012|A peak experience|5|This is probably our 10th visit to Gracie's, and it continues to be our favorite restaurant in foody Providence. We splurged on the 7-course chef's tasting menu, and it was absolutely fabulous. It's so rare -- but every single course was of the highest quality; none of them dropped by comparison with the others. Add to that the perfect portion sizes, beautiful presentation, impeccable service, and you have an immensely gratifying restaurant experience.

Our server Joe was fantastic, but the food is what stands out. The combinations are very unusual and work together to make the ""perfect bite."" There is a reason everything is on the plate - it's not just garnish. There were too many things we can't eat (shellfish) on the tasting menu so we did the prix fixe (basically like getting dessert for free). We had the poached egg (very good) and foie gras (amazing) to start, then the skate (yummy) and lamb special, and choc cake (cake itself just OK) and lemon pudding cake for dessert. WOW"

Thank goodness I was with a friend who enjoys sharing plates. Every bite was fresh and delicious and splendidly presented. The complimentary between meal offerings were delicious little surprises. The three artisan bread choices were amazing and offered over and over during the meal. Our servers were enthusiastic and informative and seemed to get caught up in our excitement. Warm cookies when we picked up the car from the valet! WOW! Pre theater service was carefully respected by the staff and we were reminded thoughtfully during our 1 1/2 hour dining. Delightful experience all around! Thank you.
May 10, 2012|It was absolutely perfect!|5|It was absolutely perfect! At $35 for a prix fixe 3 course meal how can you go wrong? The service is attentive without hovering. I wrote a note in the reservation about something I wanted and they accommodated me. I've found that not many places will honor simple requests made through reservations on this site. I highly highly recommend Gracie's and I will be going there again.

The service was top notch. We loved all the little extras like the ""special occasion"" decorated table, the champagne anniversary toast, the homemade breads, the sample soup shooter from the chef, the passion fruit sorbet served in between courses, they brought our desserts out with a candle, and when they brought the check it came with a small bag with a couple homemade cookies to take home. We left very happy! Thank you Gracie's!!"

From the moment you walk in until you leave, the attention to service is outstanding. It is amazing that you can be in the middle of the dining room and feel like you are the only ones in the restaurant. The food is imaginative, fresh, and surprising you with flavors. It is wonderful that you can eat in such a relaxed manner,and know that your server is mindful that you need to make the 7:30 show at Trinity. Definitely this is a place to return to again and again!

At the same time, it was a great deal because I wasn't the one paying. :) The servers were extremely attentive and the orchestration of flavor, texture, and presentation all came together to produce a memorable meal. It wasn't loud, but I didn't feel the need to suppress a laughter either. There were groups of elderly friends, couples, girlfriends, basically a melange of people all gathered at Gracie's for a unique dining experience. However, being a poor college student, I will probably not be coming here too often. But in my dreams, once I'm a self made millionaire, I would definitely find my way back to Gracie's.

Much lauded dessert - waiter's ""favorite"" - chocolate chocory cake was dry. So I left again thinking I won't be back very soon. Just a bit of a mixed bag."
April 21, 2012|They were so good to us!|4|They were so good to us! It was our anniversary. They gave us a complementary glass of champagne and had a love note on the table and pretty confetti stars. The food was superb as was the service. My husband said the fois gras was the best he ever had, even considering what he ate in France. I had a salad with crab and the veggies were delicious. For a main meal, my husband had duck which he said was outstanding, but there wasn't enough of it - the only reason we marked the restaurant good instead of great. I had skate and it was superb. For dessert, he had lemon pudding cake with pistachio ice cream, I had a half of panna cotta - orange and yogurt. I only had half cuz the hubby finished it off:-) We would definitely go back.

April 18, 2012|Just love this restaurant...|5|"Just love this restaurant... The service is ALWAYS the very best..it is all about us...not them! The pre fix cannot be beat and they have it all the time, not just during restaurant week. Your glass is always full, the bread basket is always going by just in case you want a refill of The best assortment of bread ever..the food beyond compare..ALWAYS fresh, perfectly cooked and presented and ""just enough"". The wait staff...the best....knowledgeable of the wine list, the menu and what is really yummy, and if you go there frequently what you ate or drank in your last visit...we all like to be remembered! Bottom line...friendly safe place for a single gal to go alone or with friends and romantic when go with a date...comfy. Thanks Gracie's"
April 14, 2012|Just skip it. Poor service.|1|"Reservations were for 9pm, they sat us at 9:20. We ordered drinks, then had to wait 15 minutes. In the HOUR AND A HALF we spent there, we had a round of drinks and one appetizer. Worst service I have ever had. I came ready to spend money for a good meal, but I was so frustrated by the time the app came, I asked for my check. I also saw the bartender put his fingers in someone's drink. The staff were too busy socializing with each other to pay attention to the customers - at one point, there were 6 staff at the end of the bar just chatting. On a busy Saturday night. Also, our supposed server never actually came to our table. I have no idea how Gracie's got a ""Best of"" award. I'll never go back."
April 14, 2012|Consider my mind blown|5|This is the third time I've been to Gracie's. What's so amazing is that the menu has been significantly different each time. The chefs put a lot of work into seasonal changes. Last time I was there, the foie gras appetizer was out of this world. Of course I wanted it again, but they had made a change - instead of being savory, the preparation was sweet...jams, compotes, etc. I skeptically ordered it, and wow! Fantastic. I'm sure the remainder of the food we ate was also great, but I couldn't get that amazing foie out of my mind.
April 14, 2012|The food at Gracie's was phenomenal|5|The food at Gracie's was phenomenal. My friends and I were restraining ourselves from licking our plates after every course. Go for the $35 pre fix menu where you get an app, entree and dessert - great deal. Very popular place with tightly scheduled reservations so we felt like we were rushed out of there when the check was dropped. Server actually came over and asked if there was something else she could get us (no, we're all set) ok she proceeded, then could she get our car from the valet... Kind of rude and we felt like we couldn't even finish up our coffee! Other than that, service throughout the meal was great and food for the price definitely makes us want to return to Gracie's again.

April 3, 2012|A Providence gem|5|Gracies is a wonderful place for a special occasion. We have gone for our anniversary, and a birthday. It's a bit pricey. But, worth it for a special occasion. Pre fixes are enjoyable, especially with the paring wines. The service can't be beat.

The only snag in the the evening was that our reservation was for 8:15 and we were not seated until almost 9, and that was only after speaking to the hostess rather sternly. Once we were seated they gave us a complimentay cheese plate and liquers with our dessert. The service was wonderful and the food delicious. The only off note on the whole evening was the hostess, who seemed very uninterested in anything but refilling the votive candles.

March 30, 2012|We enjoyed our appetizer and|3|We enjoyed our appetizer and entre very much but didn't care for the desert. The service was strange, parts of it were good, parts sporatic. We had to ask if we could order a drink before dinner and felt rushed as our dinners came while we were still having drinks. I ordered a glass of wine with dinner and didn't get it until I was done with dinner. We had to wait a long time for someone to take our check (we had to get up and find someone. The service did not fit the quality of the food.

The food...amazing local ingredients prepared imaginatively and skillfully, the meal was one of the most memorable I've had. The gnocchi were light and well-seasoned and accompanied by a braised oxtail the reminded me why I love that so much. My bacon-wrapped monkfish was a pairing made in heaven. The service attentive and well orchestrated without being intrusive. One of the finest dining experiences I've ever had.

March 24, 2012|Perhaps one of the best dinners|5|Perhaps one of the best dinners we've had. We opted for the 7-course tasting menu with wine and it was perfect. It takes some time (nearly 3 hours), but it is well worth the investment. Each course is beautifully presented and the intricacy of each plate is astounding, yet not too busy - everything works. The wine pairings were nearly perfect - a few minor mismatches. Service was a perfect blend of courtesy, friendliness, attentiveness and professionalism. Overall a spectacular evening of amazing food and wine! Another nice touch - we were celebrating birthdays, so the table was set up with stars and we received a complimentary toast - nicely done!
March 24, 2012|Amazing Dinner|5|Went here with a friend before attending a show at PPAC and had a phenomenal dinner. We did the 5-course chef's tasting with martinis and wine and everything was perfectly prepared, explained thoroughly by the staff, and tasted wonderful. Everything was fresh and the portions were perfect - not overly stuffed by the end of the meal. The dessert was to die for and even included these amazing macaroons at the end of the meal. It's definitely a special occasion place but every time I have a special occasion, it's the place that I'm going to head to. Definitely a must try if you've never been here! Make a reservation as it becomes extremely crowded on weekends and theater nights.
March 24, 2012|The food and service at Gracie's|5|The food and service at Gracie's are always exceptional. Getting delicious food that is well prepared and then served by staff who are knowledgable and ready to share their knowledge makes for a most satisfying dining experience.

Even if you do the 3 course, they throw in a lot of little extras. They gave us a free glass of champagne, because it was our anniversary. Love this place!
March 3, 2012|Incredible!|5|"Gracie's was recommended to us by a fabulous chef who deemed it ""the best place to eat in Providence."" Wow, was he right!! My husband and I haven't stopped talking about our meals (gnocchi, scallops, ribeye, hazelnut mousse, creme brule). We went for the 3 course Prix Fixe and found every dish to be exceptionally flavorful and delicious. Now that we know what the chef is capable of preparing, we will return again to try the 5 course chef's tasting menu."

Once seated, we then waited for another 30 min at our table before ANYONE said hello to us. again, not good. Once we had ordered food, it took another 30 min before our first course came. The good: EVERYTHING ELSE. Food was exquisite! The wait staff was very nice and accommodating. Owner was understanding about the slow service from the kitchen and made up for it with additional food and drinks throughout the night. The kitchen was clearly backed up, and I trust that is not an every night thing. All in all the food was so stellar it made up for anything else! We will go back as often as we can!

Based solely on the menu items consumed my wife and I agreed that a fair comparison would be with FARM in Napa. Thankfully Gracie's was half the price, but no less enjoyable. Both Jeffrey's Greens Salad and the Sherry Roasted Beet Salad were sublime starters. We then moved on to the Crescent Farms Duck - cooked to perfection - and my own entree, the All Natural Black Angus Ribeye. The ribeye was cooked exactly as ordered and presented in such a wonderful way, so as to guide my path of consumption - two halves separated by spicy greens and pearl onion confit.

February 24, 2012|love at Gracie's|5|There are a lot of good reviews out there about Gracie's and all of them are true. You really can't ask for a more romantic location. It is key to make a reservation and to mention if you are there celebrating anything. Gracie's does a good job of catering to what the event is. All in all I would say Gracie's is a great find and will most definately be going back.
February 22, 2012|exceeded expectations|5|We visit Providence once a year,knowing we will always have a fabulous dining experience. Gracie's exceeded all expectations. No matter who we talked to, they suggested we try Gracie's...we listen to the locals. Fantastic.
February 21, 2012|Loved it--a little more classy|4|Loved it--a little more classy than I usually opt for, but Gracie's was well worth it. I was pleasantly surprised when I got the bill as well. Super high quality eats. Can't wait to go back.
February 21, 2012|Perfect Birthday Celebration!|5|Gracie's was the perfect spot to celebrate my birthday. It is a gorgeous gem of a restaurant. They gave us a romantic special table for two. The owner took our picture. They even gave me a birthday card! The food was delicious from start to finish.. We had the wine pairing which was also perfect. The service was excellent with out being snobby or intrusive. We loved Gracie's and would go back in a heartbeat.
February 18, 2012|Good for a Special Night|4|We first visited this when heading to the Theatre with our 6 year old daughter. That night was a quickie stop in for a quick bite to eat. Because of that night we decided to come back and experience a tasting. This was our Valentine night dinner and and so I was willing to splash a little more dosh for a romantic night. We chose the 5 course tasting without the wine pairings. The various tastings were excellent satisfying our taste buds. The only negative was that eaching tasting was prestty small. I left the restaruant hungry eating the cookies handed out by the Valet. Overall this was a great night, Service, Food, Wine, Valet all top notch. Only negative was the amount of food for the tastings. little pricey but I expected that.

The service was a little slow with a long time between courses. Overall though I was very pleased. The valet parking was free, we kept our car there while we went to the theater, and there were cookies waiting in the car when we returned!
February 17, 2012|Simply the best meal that|5|Simply the best meal that we have had in a long while. Wine pairings with our meal were great. Service staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu options and help guide our selections. Overall a great experience.

February 15, 2012|Standing Above the Providence Creme|5|I took my girlfriend to Gracie's as a make-up V-day dinner (she had class on Vday). After a lively debate over going Prix fixe, a la carte, or food sampler, we decided to save the sampler for later and go with the fixe. It had duck that melted in my mouth atop flavorful potatoes. She had a beet salad to start. Where's the goat cheese? Oh, it's in with the beet puree sauce! genius chef, with a waitress that was tripping over herself to accommodate my girlfriend's food allergies (those little in between tasters they give you? well not only do they give you them, but they also made a separate, vegan one for her!) it all combined with an indulgent evening we shan't forget. Love them, my new providence fav.
February 15, 2012|Overly expensive for the portion|3|Overly expensive for the portion size. Food flavor was good, but not amazing. For the price, I expected amazing and left disappointed (and hungry).
February 14, 2012|it was a fabulous experience|5|it was a fabulous experience AND meal which are key to a good evening. We loved everything we ate--perfectly prepared, unusual preparations, right temperature and cooking and the pace of serving was perfect. The staff is so knowledgable and always explained or asked if things were understood. Its clear they are allowed to sample the food and love what is being produced. We dine out a lot and I really think this is my absolute favorite restaurant in providence.
February 14, 2012|The food was outstanding.|5|"The food was outstanding. Seared foie gras appetizer followed by rib eye on escarole and mustard greens followed with the ""local"" cheese plate (VT, NH, RI). Dishes are emphasizing the local produce/climate. I'm almost certain it was the best meal I have ever had. Recommending to my foodie and well traveled friends. I would replace our waiter who was a little strange and easily recommended the highest cost items."

The staff seemed very busy, but still remained extremely courteous and attentive. At one point, they did forget to bring my drink for over a half hour... Still a wonderful experience
February 14, 2012|Perfect Valentine's day|5|This has been my best dining experience in Providence in over 6 years of regularly trying restaurants. The food was great - the foie gras appetizer was a knockout. I've never had better.
February 14, 2012|The food, the service and|5|The food, the service and the ambiance were all impeccable. My wife and I both opted for the three course prix-fixe for $35, and even though I heard before going that the portions were small, it was plenty of food for both of us. The flavors in the beet salad were exploding in my mouth and the Giannone Chicken Ballotine was excellent. Christie, our waitress, and Sam, her helper, were friendly, engaging and professional. A great experience for us and a new spot for special occasions.
February 14, 2012|Beautiful atmosphere, bartenders|5|Beautiful atmosphere, bartenders that know how to make a drink, superb food that is always fresh and inventive, food that is sustainable and bought from local vendors....is there anything better? No....This is my favorite restaurant! Just wonderful!!!

February 13, 2012|We had a lovely dinner at|4|We had a lovely dinner at Gracie's. In the past, I did not think the desserts were of the same caliber as the appetizers and main courses, but this time the desserts were sublime. Very refined, creative food in a nice atmosphere. Our waitress was not as professional as those I've had in the past (confusion about our wine order and took a long time to bring it), but otherwise the service was fine. One of my favorite restaurants in Providence.

February 11, 2012|Another perfect night at Gracie's|5|My husband and I found this amazing restaurant one Saturday night. Sitting in a corner by the bar we fell in love with Gracie's and have been coming back ever since. The service, food, and ambiance are perfect and this visit was no exception. The foie gras and the gnocci are my two favorite dishes here but you can never go wrong with a tasting menu expertly paired with wine. I promise you won’t be disappointed.
February 11, 2012|Superb night out!|5|This was a special (and rare) night out for us and Gracie's didn't disappoint; the food was heavenly, the wine excellent, and the service friendly, efficient and attentive. Can't wait 'til our next visit!

Gnocchi with foraged mushrooms (an appetizer) was especially great. Only one wrong note in the entire meal, and even that wasn't too bad. The $35 prix fixe in which diners can choose their own dishes is a fabulous idea; wish more restaurants would pick that up. We will be back.

If you are a couple looking for a quiet place to have dinner and reconnect or just friends looking for a place to catch up Gracie's is fit ""for all"".. Food and drink is always the best we had the pre-fix with the special and was very happy--but w=e are always with Gracie's. All we are waiting for is the Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon to arrive!! Gracie's is a great restaurnat with great service and attention to details...The valet service is nice as the restaurant is in the city. You can ALWAYS look forward to getting in your car to chocolate chip cookies on the seat, as a treat. That is true attention to detail and service."

February 4, 2012|All time favorite|5|"I love fine food, and have enjoyed dining at many fine restaurants - but this was definitely the best meal of my life. Granted, it was the most expensive - but it definitely proved the ""you get what you pay for"" mantra. We'd definitely recommend it for special occasions. If you're going to spend the money anyway, definitely do the tasting. It's the best experience!"
February 3, 2012|Impressed us jaded new yorkers|5|We picked this place because it was #1 in Providence on opentable and we feel it definitely lived up to it. The food was terrific, a couple nice amuses-bouche touches, the service was extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.... would definitely recommend this. Only issue was they were out of several things on the menu that night, some of which we were looking forward to trying. But overall an excellent dinner.

January 31, 2012|One of our best dining experiences!|5|WOW!! We were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided upon the 7 course tasting with wine pairing. It was phenomenal! Not only was the chef incredibly innovative with his choices, but with his presentation as well. Oh, and the taste!! Perhaps because we chose a Tuesday night, we had a lot of attention, with a full explanation with each course and each wine. This was truly a wonderful experience, and, although it was expensive, it was still a great value!
January 28, 2012|Went for restaurant week with|5|"Went for restaurant week with a couple of friends. One, a roommate at scool, is suspected of having a severe mental deficiency, and had never been to what we would call a ""nice"" restaurant. He tore through each course as though it were a timed competition, and when aske how he liked it declared that it was ""way better than Olive Garden."" I agree, it is much better than OG, and they have a 35 dollar prix fixe option available all year making fine food accessible. Very well executed. There was also an exploding champagne bottle to liven things up. I can't wait to dine with people more familiar with real food! Also, four different house-made selections in their bread service."
January 28, 2012|Overall I thought the food|3|Overall I thought the food was very good. One of the main complaints I had was that they sat us at a table that was right next to the hostess stand. I had to look at the florescent light of at the hostess stand the entire night and we both got blasted with cold air every time someone came into the restaurant. A restaurant with that type of menu should't have a table in that poor of a location.
January 28, 2012|Absolutely wonderful. A wonderful|5|Absolutely wonderful. A wonderful evening out. A very fine dining experience. And quite affordable too.
January 28, 2012|Great meal, great service|5|Truly enjoyed our meal and attentive, enthusiastic service by our server. Very close to Trinity Rep and Providence Performing Arts Center for pre theater dining. I like the opportunity to do chef's tastings, a fixed price three-course meal or just a la carte. Might have been a tad crowded due to Restaurant Week, but we will be coming back.
January 28, 2012|Another fixed price gem -|4|Fast, courteous service with outstanding food. We were surprised by yet another fixed price menu that really produced at a very fair price. Portions aren't oversized but the flavor certainly is - excellent experience and wonderful food.
January 28, 2012|"Our new ""go to"" place in Providence"|5|"We frequently eat out in Providence, as our daughter lives down there. We've had several ""go to"" spots over the years. We tried Gracie's because it was Restaurant Week. In the past, we thought of it as a ""splurge"" restaurant. Our RW week dinner was delicious, and the whole experience was elegant but comfy. The waitstaff works together to be friendly and accommodating, without being obtrusive. Kudos to both the front of the house and the kitchen! Best of all, we were surprised to learn that Gracie's has a prix fixe dinner EVERY night, that is just a bit more than RW, with all of their items available (some at an upcharge) that makes it an affordable option that doesn't have to be limited to ""special occasions."""
January 28, 2012|A gem|5|Impeccable service, exquisite menu. The simplest dishes are heavenly - I had the cod which was far from boring and the beet salad was a nice surprise. A wonderful dining experience
January 27, 2012|One word: Amazing! We went|5|One word: Amazing! We went for restaurant week and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive despite how busy the restaurant was; she made it a priority to come to our table more than once. Food was excellent! I had the roasted beet salad, crescent farms duck, and crème brulee. I have never been interested in eating duck but decided to be adventurous that night and Gracie’s crescent farms duck was perfect! They also bought many complimentary treats from the chief, which was a great addition to their excellent service. Gracie’s is worth their price! Highly recommended restaurant for dates, girls night out, or simply having dinner with friends or a lover.
January 27, 2012|Lovely city spot with wonderful|4|Lovely city spot with wonderful service and fantastic food. This is not a casual dinner spot; expect to pay $15-$20 per cocktail when you first sit down, and it all goes up in price from there. A perfect spot for a special celebration or romantic night out.

January 26, 2012|Lovely night|4|We had a lovely meal last week. Everything was fabulous. I can't believe I waited this long to try Gracie's . We didn't get the cookies in the car everyone talks about but attention to detail was excellent. We had a great server John who wasn't our main server I think back waiter but he was excellent with tellig is explanations of everything. Highly recommend asking for him if you go!
January 26, 2012|Absolutely Wonderful!|5|Finally went to Gracie's and you should buy into the hype. Absolutely amazing. We had the five course chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. Wow! One of the best meals I have had in recent memory. I am ashamed that I have lived in RI for almost eight years and just made it to Gracie's! The decor was lovely and the valet with the cookies in the car was absolutely great! Definitely a five star experience. I will absolutely be back! If you haven't been here, you should run, not walk!
January 26, 2012|Attended dinner with family|4|Attended dinner with family during restaurant week which can skew first impressions but found the whole experience terrific. The food was wonderful.. different but not crossing over to the weird, great little touches such as tiny tastings between courses and even a fresh baked cookie in the car which I had valeted. Maybe my favorite thing was the espresso manhattan from the bar, an original creation by our waiter/ part time bartender. He even went and made the drinks as the bar was particularly busy at the time. The only drawback was a bit too long a wait for the food, but it was restaurant week, so forgiven . Beet salad was a superb blend of flavors and the duck entree was offered as breast or dark meat.
January 25, 2012|Love this place!|5|Have never had a bad dish here, and the staff goes out of the way to make you comfortable. Also, the chef always sends out little gems between courses.
January 24, 2012|A Terrific Find|5|My wife and I decided to enjoy dinner at Gracie's before going to a movie. I only wish we could have stayed longer and done one of the tasting menus! The staff was very polite and friendly, with our server frequently giving advice and opinions on the food and beverages. She even went back to talk with the kitchen and find out what the major herb was in a particular soup my wife had. The food itself was excellent, some of the best I've had since moving to Providence, and the cocktails were well-made too. My bacon-wrapped monk fish was terrific, and the 3-item vegetable entree that my wife ordered was outstanding. If you really want to be pampered, go for an early (5-6ish) dinner on a Tuesday ... the crowds were starting to pick up around 7.
January 24, 2012|The food was outstanding and|5|The food was outstanding and the presentation was excellent. I would take a special guest there from 50 miles away! We visited during Restaurant Week and were extremely pleased.

January 20, 2012|What a fantastic dinner!|5|What a fantastic dinner! I went to Gracie's during the 2012 Providence Restaurant Week. My meal consisted of a Brooklyn IPA (highly recommended by the waiter and a great complement to the meal), Russet potato gnocchi with oxtail/mushrooms/celeriac puree, a perfectly seared duck breast with butternut squash puree/roasted root veggies/pomegranate seeds, and a spiced chocolate mousse with burnt sugar ice cream. It was a long dinner (7:30 PM - 10:00 PM), but I did not even notice the time passing. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and a bit snarky, which I very much appreciated, as well as thoughtful about the possibility of dietary restrictions. I wish I could say more, but that duck breast simply needs to be tasted.

The service was attentive but not overdone. You would have never known if was restaurant week. They were so professional. And if you are a gin and lime fan get the botanical cocktail!
January 18, 2012|Favorite Restaurant in Providence|5|I have been to Gracies a few times before and every time is wonderful! Our server Lydia was fantastic as always and the food was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. We had a great time and can't wait to go back again!

The waitstaff - especially Lydia our server - was attentive and friendly. I plan to visit again!

We started with Lobster bisque and a greens salad and they were both worthy of a finger swipe on the plate. One perfectly cooked steak sliced and drizzled with mushroom onion confetti of flavors and one duck nestled in lentils and vegetables made for a beautiful meal and the last bit of bread wiped the drizzle just fine. The portions are plenty and full of flavor, the bread with salted butter flowed and the creme brulee sent us packing with happy faces. The steamy latte was a brilliant companion and the ambiance is fit for a proposal. We can't wait to go back and try the tasting menu...

December 17, 2011|Stop looking- This is it!|5|If you have been looking for the BEST restaurant in Providence (maybe RI) this is it! The food quality and service for the value is unmatched. Forget the “hill” if you are looking for consistency with every visit, establishing a rapport with knowledgeable caring professionals who do not say “what can I get-cha”, are you “all set” and “how are you guys doing tonight”; this is it! If you are looking for comfort and ambiance this is it! If you are looking for that place to impress or thank someone important to you; this is it! If you are looking for that establishment which defines the fine-dining industry segment; this is it!

She said it was the best duck she's ever had in her life :)"
December 15, 2011|Worth every penny!|5|Gracie's is consistently one of the best dining experiences in Providence. The option to choose 3 courses starting at $35 cannot be beat. The food is thoughtful, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Little touches including amuse bouche & cookies from the valet separate Gracie's from the rest of the pack and make for a memorable meal. It's the perfect atmosphere for a celebration or a quiet weeknight dinner date and everything in between.

December 9, 2011|We read many glowing reviews|3|We read many glowing reviews of Gracie's and looked forward to our meal there. The restaurant prides itself on using locally grown produce, etc., which we like to support. However, we found Gracie's to be overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. There is a $35 prix fixe menu but most items have a surcharge and the there are very few choices that would bring the meal to the $35 price. Our party of 4 had 5 drinks, 3 prix fixe meals, 1 appetizer, 1 desert and the bill came to $280. We had no wine. The food was ordinary and the portions were minimal. Of the chicken, fish, and scallops, the chicken was deemed the best dish. The apple carrot cake was dry and tasted like spice cake. Our waiter, Paul, was great and so was the bread

We will definitely be back !! 5 STARS !! Definitley try Gracies !!
December 7, 2011|Gracie's is the go to place|4|Gracie's is the go to place when out of town colleagues are in town. The food is fresh, seasonal and always different. One of the menu features is the 3 course price fixe which is really worth the $35 or a little more depending on the dishes. The lobster bisque is always the favorite, but try the gnocchi and not be disappointed. Seafood entrees are the way to go. Then, I always go for chocolate whatever.

Food, service, attention to detail, food, ambience, food, staff and food were beyond the standard of a bar already set quite high.

My boyfriend's birthday dinner was more than memorable because of dinner at Gracie's. Isn't that what it's supposed to be about?
December 6, 2011|Every meal has been better|5|Every meal has been better than the one before, which is why it get's the first 4 stars. Gracie's gets 5 stars from me because the food is world class. My definition is pretty simple: would I be craving a meal here if I were somewhere else in the world? Like I do the duck with olives at Allard in Paris, or the porcini mushrooms at Charlie Trotters in Chicago. I think I would crave Gracie's perfect little foie gras ravioli served with the duck from anywhere in the world.

December 2, 2011|Outstanding food|4|This was our first time to Gracie's -- the service was great, food was perfectly prepared. It was not as packed as we thought it would be before the show at Trinity Rep across the street, which made for a romantic dinner for two.. prices are on the high side, but it was well worth it for the food, service and ambiance.
November 26, 2011|The management team at Gracie's|5|The management team at Gracie's must be very special. Every person you encounter seems genuinely happy to work there. The staff makes the restaurant very comfortable for the diners. Our server, Joe was just naturally friendly and very good at his job. The food was delicious--I'm still thinking about the littleneck clam appetizer! The bartender and the valet parker couldn't have been nicer. This place is a gem.

November 12, 2011|Great Food..Disappointing Service|4|We have been to Gracie's two times; both times their service was poor-fair. We had to, both times, ask where our wait person was and when they would visit our table. For a restaurant with this amount of panache they need to get their front of the restaurant in better shape.

Gracie's has delicious foods made with local and fresh foods, some grown on their very on roof top gardens. Gracies meal were fairly priced with a 3 course meal starting a 35$. The waitress was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and some foods. Although the website doesn't mention a dress code, I would recommend going to Gracie's in semi-formal attire. Between each course the waitress brought us complimentary on the house tastings, of items that weren't on the menu. For those that are adventurous you can choose a 5 or 7 course tastings of meals not on the menu and were created by the chef that day. Each tasting is paired with a wine. We were very pleased.

November 10, 2011|Seven surprises superbly served|5|For the first time, my wife and I ordered the seven course chef's tasting menu. It is a bit of an adventure since you do not know what is coming until they bring it. I have dined in various places in the U.S. and Europe and can say that this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The service was excellent with an extremely knowledgable, personable and attentive waitperson, Christy. We will be back to do this again.
November 9, 2011|We showed up late for our|5|We showed up late for our reservation which gave us less than an hour to eat before a show at the Dunkin Donuts Center. The staff was very accommodating and our food came out very quickly. The lobster and butternut squash bisque was one of the best soups I've ever had, and the gnocchi was fantastic as well. Our entrees were also excellent. The duck was cooked perfectly! Valet parking was free and we were able to leave our car there during the show. We even opted to get dessert, the cheese plate, and risk being a couple minutes late to the show. The selection of five cheeses and accompaniments was delicious. The amuse bouche and sorbet were nice touches as well. Will definitely return if ever in Providence again.
November 9, 2011|Excellent meal at Gracies|5|My wife and I had a fabulous dinner ar Gracies this week. The food was outstanding from the house baked bread basket to dessert. Fois gras, beet salad appetizers, nightly fish special (cod), rib eye, pumpkin bread pudding and sweet potato pie all hit the mark perfectly. The only slight, slight issue was that some might find the lentil accompaniment to the fish a bit salty. I found it right on the border and my wife just a bit too much. The servers were all attentive and even offered my wife tea as she had a bit of a cold. Would highly recommend the restaurant.
November 8, 2011|I took some members of senior|5|I took some members of senior management out to dinner at Gracie's, and they really loved it. My guests are all from NYC, so I consider them very hard to please when it comes to food. Personally, I loved it as well and try to find any reason to go back. They really make food an art.
November 5, 2011|This was our third time at|4|"This was our third time at Gracie's, the first 2 times the food, service and ambience were perfect. This time, service was lacking, our main server was distracted, terse and just OK. We sat in the bar section as opposed to the dining room which was distracting and less intimate for a ""date night"" / special occasions. Will request dining room next time. Food, as always, was amazing!!!"

November 4, 2011|A talented and inventive chef!|5|We were extremely impressed with Gracie's! The food was top-notch, and the chef uses all local ingredients, including growing his own exotic fruits and curing his own pork. The balance of flavors was perfect in every dish. The wine list is somewhat overpriced and our assistant server was a bit too quick on the draw, trying to take our plates away while we were still eating, but our chief waitress was terrific; helpful, funny and informative. We will definitely be back.

October 28, 2011|A gem|5|This is the first time we have eaten at Gracies at this location. The restaurant used to be on federal Hill and we always liked it. I planned a birthday celebration for my husband and the restaurant surprised us both with a flute of champagne to begin. Dinner was wonderful, service attentive and food was on the table in a timely manner. This may be one of the best restaurants in Providence. We are both hooked and will return.

October 22, 2011|We planned to order a la carte,|4|"We planned to order a la carte, but our waiter steered us to one of the tasting menus (they offer 5 or 7 course). The food itself was excellent (particularly the gnocchi), and we certainly got enough to eat between the 7 tastes and 3 additional ""treats from the kitchen"" (which you get regardless of whether you order a tasting menu, as it turns out). The problem is simply that knowing we were overspending for what we were actually getting took away from the enjoyment of the meal. The quality did not justify the price tag - there are enough restaurants in Providence with comparable quality food, that I would not go back here even though we are foodies and even though we knew in advance how much we would be spending."

It was for a birthday and they had stars on the table as well as a complimentary (cava) toast. Great wine pairings and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the wine selections. Noise was loud due to an event going on in the bar, and there were no warm chocolate chip cookies on the seat from valet which I had read about. But overall excellent and highly recommended.

We nearly always order the 5 course tasting menu and are never disappointed. Especially notable on our most recent visit were the gnocchi with lamb bolognese and the seared scallop with pumpkin (neither on the regular menu). The wine list, although not long, is intelligently designed and reasonably priced.

Every single course was well thought out, beautifully put together and tasted great. In between courses the chef brings out little complimentary tasters from the kitchen. I highly recommend this place.

October 11, 2011|Best Restaurant in Providence|5|The best restaurant in Providence! This was one of the most memorable meals of my life. We did the 7 course tasting paired with wine and each course was more delicious and interesting than the last: local striped bass ceviche, gnocchi with house butchered mutton bolognese, quail, warm pumpkin brioche bread pudding with tart cranberry sauce. The wine pairings were diverse as well, spanning countries as well as varietals: Connecticut to Chile, dry white to sparkling Italian brachetto. Courtney was our server and she was welcoming, informative, always there at the right moment, yet unobtrusive. Awesome service. Oh, and I started with one of their martinis-spiced pear chocolate- it was delicious! Everything was perfect! I can't wait to go back!
October 8, 2011|Romance at Gracie's|5|First time at Gracie's and it was everything and more than expected. Beautifully romantic upon entering with candles flickering against warm woods set a relaxed mood for delicious dining. The Bass, caught and delivered that morning, was perfectly cooked and accompanied by fresh local produce. The Mission Fig Tart, perhaps my new favorite dessert, was a perfect blend of pastry, lightly sweetened goat cheese and fresh figs, paired with a Muscadet rather than coffee was the right choice. Staff was lively, competent and thorough. Overall delicious and romantic evening!

His name was Paul. PS. He preceded to accidentally spill our wine and made it up with a dessert wine. Wine list consisted of many high end wines, that are not that well known.

September 29, 2011|Service was very attentive|5|Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. Their explanations about the menu were thorough and helpful. The octopus salad was delicious, but the veal sweetbreads will be avoided in the future, only due to personal taste, although the other components of the dish were enjoyed. The striped bass was perfectly cooked and paired with roasted red pepper puree was excellent. The vegetable tastings came as a surprise, and was still thoroughly enjoyed for its uniqueness and variety. And of course dessert was the hit of the night, the fig tart was good, and the chocolate mousse was complex, rich and out of this world.
September 28, 2011|This was a wonderful dining|5|This was a wonderful dining experience. It was my first time at the restaurant and everything was top shelf. Our servers, I believe Paul and Sam, were exceptional. We both had the three course Prix Fixe dinner, and for $35.00 it was a bargain. I would love to try the 7 course. The woman I was with had some special requests as to how her dinner should be prepared and she was accommodated. We both had a martini with dinner and they were prepared as ordered, straight up, very dry and very cold. I have dined out a lot at many very nice [and expensive] restaurants. Gracie's is at the top of my list.

September 23, 2011|5 stars for everything but the food|4|Quaint restaurant with warm ambience, ideal for a group get-together or a romantic dinner. The service (bartenders included) was top notch--courteous, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu items. The meal options (3/5/8-course tasting, a la carte) was an interesting idea and would appeal to all target groups, for those happy with a 3 course meal to those seeking a unique culinary experience. The prices were affordable and as expected for such eclectic food. Desserts were delicous, first courses were good but the entrees were disappointing. The chef uses an array of flavors in each dish but none of them left us impressed (we had pasta, duck and chicken). Unfortunately, we won't be going back, unless it's just for drinks & dessert.
September 23, 2011|A foodie find A+|5|This was a great surprise while we were on vacation inPVD, this was a great meal and you are treated to very nice and surprising treats along the way between courses and the valet left two warm chocolate chip cookies in your car when you leave.

And if we want to impress out-of-state guests, they are impressed with Providence because of dinner at Gracies. This latest visit was pre-theatre for four of us. Our server asked us if we were going to the theatre and then timed everything so we could have a leisurely drink and dinner and get to the theatre on-time. All four agreed that their meal was fabulous.

The wait staff was great: neither of us wanted a big meal, so instead we ordered several appetizers to share, and they were all excellent. And the staff split them all for us, something we had not requested but which was very nicely done.
September 13, 2011|A Providence Gem|5|Gracies was as good as any restuarant you would find in New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles. We had a five course chefs tasting menu paired with wines and it was exquisite. Our waiter (Kristi) was very knowledgable and made our time there delightful. Thank You Gracie's!

This restaurant is fabulous - from the four selections of freshly baked breads to our server's input on the entrees and wine - and the desserts were superb. We had the lamb and the cod dishes, enjoyed the roasted tomato soup with a lovely presentation. The fruit tart and the chocolate mousse were devoured. I'd highly recommend Gracie's in Providence. We normally go into Boston for fine dining. Be sure to try Gracie's tasting menu. The 3-course menu for $35 is a deal. This fall are special food/wine events so check it out."

September 3, 2011|not quite 100%|3|Gracies _used_ to be _the best_ dining experience in Providence... not sure what happened. The service is a bit off, the food seems to be variants of the same food served under the previous chef (aka. thus nothing new or innovative), wine is always warm (aka. not properly chilled or kept to the correct temperatures), etc. We also saw this: one of the couple sitting next to us had to send their food back; meaning: each had to eat their meals unaccompanied.... really? While we will continue to go to Gracies (since it is not bad), sadly, we don't go as often as we used to.
September 3, 2011|Perfect dining experience|5|I usually pick restaurants by their rating on Opentable and Yelp. Gracie's had the best rating in Providence and they totally deserve it. The food was wonderful and the service was outstanding (not one issue, not one misstep). This was a great dining experience and we look forward to doing it again.

There when you need him but keeps a safe distance for our girl chats! Very friendly bar as well patrons nice but not intrusive or pushy. The wait staff and food is always great and the service is above and beyond..the other night we had Lidia (can't remember if her name is spelt with an I or a Y) as our server-she was great with the 3 of us gals. Portions are the right size-no giant economy size-just enough, service above and beyone by all, and drinks perfect....put that all together and you have a great restaurant. Oh, lets not forget the valet parking-another great guy!
August 27, 2011|Spectacular restaurant|5|Wonderful establishment - superb service, great ambiance, both tasty and creative menu. This is the ideal place for a classy occasion or a special nigt out. We came from Boston and this place puts many of the high end restaurants to shame! Wish we were closer, but will be definitely returning a few times a year for special occasions.
August 26, 2011|twice (dinner) in a week.|3|twice (dinner) in a week. Same hostess at the entrance. An iceberg. Food good. Not outstanding. Gnocchi, scallops, steak and dessert good. Lamb so hard impossible to eat. Gnocchi had different sauces in the two dinners. Treats between plates to forget excluding the little sorbet. Ordered two same dessert from the same menu and one was half of the other with no explanation (waiter disappeared). Wine list limited and with no logical path. You can find, for example, millesime champagne but only a couple. It looks as they find a discount to buy that kind of bottle but they do not have any ideas of what they are serving. Sometimes simpler it is better. Service oppressive from an european point of view. Cookies found in the car only once.
August 26, 2011|Gracies is by far my favorite|5|Gracies is by far my favorite restaurant in Providence and maybe ever. The food is amazing and no matter what you get-you will NOT be disappointed. The service is impecable and I really have yet to find any restaurant that comes close to the attention that you get at Gracies from everyone from the minute you arrive. If you haven't been there-you are missing out on an amazing experience.

They were extra special to my wife because I had mentioned it that it was her birthday. The menu is short but we both found something we liked and it was delicious. Our servers provided just the right amount of attention and we would return in a heartbeat.
August 20, 2011|Special Occassion - 8/20/11|5|This was my second time to Gracie's and it lived up to the amazing standard they created the first time I dined there. The first was a romantic dinner with my fiance for restaurant week, which was a suggestion from a friend that I trust her recommendations regarding food and wine. The second time was a special occassion with both her parents in from California and my parents. Our waiter was fantastic!!! Whitty, funny, involved and sincere. The food was top-notch. From the tomato soup and potato gnochi to the duck breast (cooked perfect) and beautiful wines, everything lived up to our high standards. We even parked our car with the complimentary valet. We had fresh mini choc. chip cookies waiting for us when we sat back in the car.
August 20, 2011|Menu reads like a bedtime story|3|Gracie's has been a fixture in downtown Providence for more than 10 years. Fine food but a simple menu is made bewildering by a myriad of choices for fixed price options that requires a lenghty dissertation by the wait staff to decipher. Apparently the menu changes so frequently that even the wait staff doesn't know what an item may contain on any particular night. The wine list is as long as the Book of Jobe and is way too dense considering the slight paucity of menu choices. The restaurant smacks of its management being culinary school grads of recent tenure, but attempts to put their coolness on display are wasted. Gracie's should let the exeptional food speak for itself and tone down the splashiness that detracts from the food.

The creative menu, the beautiful presentation the surprise amusees, the very attentive wait staff and the price fixe options make this restaurant a very special place. It is very clear that there is a great deal of hard work and good management that goes into making Gracie's a special restaurant. Going out for a nice dinner is often a disappointment but this place is a foodies dream. My only complaint was the noise level (very high ceilings). Stay on your game Gracie's ...You are doing a great job!

August 12, 2011|Have a true experience at Gracie's|5|"high quality food and service. I was so impressed with dishes - it was like the chef was hiding little ""treasures"" of surprising tastes of different sauces and veggie combinations around the main ingredient - Oh, here's a lemon aioli, here's a tapenade, etc.. In between courses, we were served little treats on Asian soup spoons that were interesting and delicious. Their creme brulee was the best I ever had, and they served complimentary french macaroons after your meal, which were unbelievable! Elegant yet comfortable and the waitstaff was very friendly."

July 30, 2011|Excellent Food in Providence!|4|Great find. Excellent food from a diverse menu. Flavors were outstanding. Great atmosphere for couples and families. Chef's tastings between courses were awesome. Prix-fixe is a nice option. Valet parking is easy and they leave cookies in the car after pick-up! Will absolutely go again, highly recommended.
July 29, 2011|Gracie's seems to be a real|5|Gracie's seems to be a real gem in the P'town dining scene. The service is outstanding with many little chef's dish brought to you complements of the house. The lamb is one of their finest dishes. We also tried the fish of the day served over lentils. The wine list is just ok, would expect more from a restaurant like this but all in all decent.
July 29, 2011|Gracie's is the best Providence|5|Gracie's is the best Providence has to order. The tastings are superb and well worth the money.
July 28, 2011|True Experience|4|Dining at Gracie's is a true experience. The restaurant is romantic and boutique like. If you are looking for a place to dine with 10 or so, ask about the private wine cellar room on the bottom floor. Options abound for the actual meal - you can order a la carte, a prix fixe or two different options for a tasting meal. Our group decided on prix fixe partly because the tasting menu was presented as secretive. Our waitress wouldn't even tell us what was on the tasting menu. A complimentary glass of sparkling wine started us off. We all enjoyed our meal - especially the Gnocchi and Corn Soup appetizer. In between each course, was a surprise tasting from the kitchen. Surprises all along including cookies in the car from the valet!
July 28, 2011|The staff and service are|5|The staff and service are the best; friendly and attentive without being annoying. The variety on the menu is wonderful and what we ordered, the halibut and duck were just spectacularly prepared. The sweet corn soup with lobster and the gnocchi appetizers were wonderful too. Attention to detail in the food preparation is apparent.
July 27, 2011|5 stars|5|Gracie's never dissapoints, attentive, knowledgable, friendly staff and the food is always top notch!

July 23, 2011|Starters and entrees were|4|Starters and entrees were fantastic. Desserts came up a bit short; the panna cotta had no flavor and a gelatinous consistency, and the cherry tart was also without much flavor. However, the rest of the meal and the service more than made up for this. We had a very nice night and will dine again at Gracie's.
July 23, 2011|Gracies has different ways|4|Gracies has different ways of ordering ala carte or 3, 5, or 7 coarse meals w/ a choice of wine pairing. We went with the 3 coarse w/ wine. they did a great job pairing the wine with each of our meals. i would definately recommend.

Dined on July 23, 2011|I love Gracies. I don't throw|5|I love Gracies. I don't throw around 5 stars on everything, but Gracies has never dissappointed me. How could I not love a place that leaves you cookies in your car for you when you valet it?! My friend and I had completely different meals, I had the corn and lobster soup, pan-seared salmon over lentils, and pound cake for dessert; he had the heirloom and mozzarella salad, duck breast with beets and potato croquette, and a cherry tart for dessert. Both meals in their entirety were amazing. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about wine, and made excellent suggestions (based soley on the way they paired with our food) and as always, the service was fantastic.
July 21, 2011|We heart Gracies!!!!|5|We enjoyed the restaurant week menu and felt spoiled.We have dined for dinner,enjoyed many of the chef series dinners, loved the James Beards dinner and have dined in the wine room as well. We love Gracies and it was as FABULOUS Thursday night as always.

July 16, 2011|Definitely one of the best.|5|We'd heard many times that Gracie's was one of the best restaurants in Providence, so we stopped in during restaurant week to check out the pre-fixe menu. Turns out, all of their delcious menu is available for a three, five, or seven course meal! I had the heirloom tomato salad, the duck, and the berry tart, and my boyfriend has the gnocchi, steak, and pound cake. Everything was excellent- well prepared, well presented, and delicious. The wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive; we never wanted for water or another glass of wine and felt well taken care of.

July 14, 2011|Our Reservation was lost.|2|Our Reservation was lost. Accomodations were made -ended up sitting in the bar. Side on one meal was changed, request not honored. Staff solicitous. Restaurant week menu boring, fish not properly cooked. Nice touches that would have made the meal, were the entrees up to par, amuse-bouche, sorbet, macroons.
July 14, 2011|Gracie's really is a special|4|Gracie's really is a special treat. The food was excellent. While some restaurants cut corners during Restaurant Week, Gracie's never has. Notable, original dishes. Yum.
July 13, 2011|Ambience of the restaurant|5|Ambience of the restaurant was great. A pleasant wait at the bar then a comfortable table. Bench seats not for those with bad backs though ! Menu was good, a nice selection while not being too huge. The service was fantastic. Any server that came to the table whether the bus boy with bread, the wine waiter with drinks or the 2 or 3 different wait staff with food, was friendly, polite, helpful and knowledgeable. I would not hesitate to recommend Gracies to anyone with a big enough wallet as it is expensive. the food was exquisite though so worth the money. take advantage of the deal during Providence Restaurant week.
July 13, 2011|Best thing I have ever eaten!|5|This was my 2nd time dining at Gracies and it just does not get better than this. The food was glorious, Chef Varga does an amazing job with every dish. Each dish was well thought out had layers of flavors. My favorite was the corn soup with scallions, lobster and mushrooms... SO GOOD. Also, the attention to detail when it comes to service is also wonderful. Our server and the rest of the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I can not wait to go back!
July 13, 2011|Great food and service. High|4|Great food and service. High noise level. Quite expensive food and wine list, but worth it for special occasion. It's easy to drop 200 bucks for a couple.

July 12, 2011|How to WOw two ladies!!|5|One again Gracie's exceeded my expectations. Took my mom there for a celebratory birthday dinner. Just us girls! It was her first visit. We had the five-course chef's tasting....absolutely wonderful! The fresh herbs, preparation and presentation were A++. The waitstaff treated my mom like royalty. She was very impressed, and of course, so was I. Thank you Gracie's for a very enjoyable culinary delight!

June 11, 2011|Great food but bad service|4|"Food, when it finally arrived, was excellent. But service was poor because it included an annoying and intrusive waiter who repeatedly overstepped his bounds as a server by offering personal comments about our party such as (among others) ""Don't bite me"" when he finally delivered the main course, after I asked why it was taking over 45 minutes to get our first course. His answer to my question about the 45 minute delay for the first course was ""It will arrive as soon as it's ready."""
June 10, 2011|We had stellar, warm service|5|"We had stellar, warm service from everyone we encountered. We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, and realized that the bar would be a great place to eat too. It was comfortable, welcoming, and beautifully designed. The only thing I could do without was the big TV, but I suppose there are more people who like that than don't. But I'm reaching to find anything in our experience that wasn't perfect. The food was delightful-- well-crafted and thoughtful without being the least overwrought. The decor is festive and pretty without being stuffy. We loved all the little ""treats"" between courses. A wonderful place. I'm just sad that I'd never tried it before, and missed out on years of great meals!"
May 31, 2011|Our favorite restaurant in|5|Our favorite restaurant in Providence for special occasions. Gracie's never disappoints. Every dish was superbly prepared and presented. They have a nice selection of wines by the glass and an excellent wine list with a wide range of price choices. The three course prix fixe dinner was a good value, even with supplemental charges for some of our selections. Worth the 45 minute drive from our home.

May 25, 2011|our favorite place in Providence:|4|our favorite place in Providence: interesting menu, great food preparation & wonderfully varied wine list. usually 5 stars, but this time - with a 6pm seating - we told them we were seeing an 8pm show at the PPAC & they said 'no problem'. at 7:40 we were wolfing down our entrees & had to skip our (prepaid) desserts. again, great food & attentive service, but SLOW & frustrating to not get to our 3rd course on a pre-fixe.

Food was outstanding, and our server Lydia was extremely knowledgeable about the many offerings and provided excellent but not overdone service. The dinner choices were varied and very interesting, and this could easily become one of my favorite restaurants.

May 7, 2011|Gracie's Hard to Beat in Providence|5|Gracie's is a true culinary treat. The dishes are adventurous without being pretentious, and they often incorporate some of the less common local ingredients such as fiddleheads. The pre-fix pricing scheme allows patrons to enjoy a 3- or 7-course meal for a reasonable price, but also has built-in flexibility for individuals wishing to try the more expensive dishes (the 3-course pre-fix starts at $35, but you can choose a more expensive dish for an additional $4-$18 per course). However, it's also possible to order a la carte. Gracie's also makes service a top priority. Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff was friendly and accommodating, without being overly dramatic. I give Gracie's my highest recommendation.

May 7, 2011|Coup de Gracie !|5|Gracie's used to be a well-kept secret among the cognoscenti of Providence. No longer! It's rather an intimate place with a limited menu, but the chef knows how to cook. And the bartender knows swimming-pool-sized martinis when he plunges into them! Our waiter was eager to please - and did! The bread and water persons circulated just the right amount. We had a lovely time!
April 30, 2011|Perfect except for communication...|4|Gracie's offers an imaginative preparation & presentation of local foods. Our dinner would have been perfect but... my wine did not arrive until the meal was almost finished despite asking for it several times. I appreciate that the Gracie's did not charge. Our main wait staff was professional yet seemed rushed & noticeably preoccupied at times with other tables. More importantly, I specifically asked the hostess for our check & promised that the staff would accommodate. When the check was delivered by a junior staff, it was placed in front of our guests, sitting on the other side of the table. I was so embarrassed as I had to lunge across the table for the bill.

April 16, 2011|Delicious and Deliciously Pricey|5|Food presentation was worthy of a Food & Wine cover. Flavor and creativity were stupendous, although portion sizes were typical of this type of true gastronomic establishments: on the small side. Should you decide not to dine a la carte, be prepared to spend much more than the prix fixe prices as dishes with a second price are added as surcharges onto the prix fixe prices. For example, if you order the rib eye entree, it's an additional $18 on top of the $35 prix fixe price. Do this for your appetizer and dessert and you will spend a heft price to dine at Gracie's. For our party of four, including drinks and a 20% tip, our total bill was $488.
April 16, 2011|Awesome at Gracie's|5|We had an exceptional wonderful experience at Gracie's. The service from the hostess to waitstaff was top notch and the food was great. I told them through OpenTable that it was an anniversary. We were wished a happy anniversary every time a new person dealt with us (4 times). They gave us a very nice table per my request - one of the semi private tables with wood/fabric surrounds. We received a complimentary glass of brut as well. This will be one of our new spots to go to on a regular basis.

April 6, 2011|Do the chef's tasting menu!|4|The night started with a coctail at the bar. I got the Citrus Grass coctail and it was delicious. Wonderful bartender. We then did the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing and it was definitely a great choice. The pea flan was amazing and the gnocchi course was delightful. Not at all heavy, which can be a problem with gnocchi. The flavors from each course were right on and the wine pairings were very well chosen. I would definitely do the chef's tasting menu again.
April 5, 2011|Gettt IT!|5|I have always wanted to eat at Gracies. I mean from the service tothe dish and the desert was amazing. I also love the little orderves sent from the shift for tasting was amazing.

The trout was pretty good,but not outstanding,there should be a sauce or something served with it - it was pretty boring. The Bass was excellent,as was the duck, the veggie entree had an egg, so the server should of told us since she was a vegetarian, and in fact I would work on that entree all together - really nothing special for $25.
March 26, 2011|It was a breath of fresh air|5|It was a breath of fresh air walking into Providence's notable Gracie's. The waitstaff was very knowledgable about their extensive wine list, and the plates were well priced for the portion you receive. It was incredibly romanitc and perfect warmth for a cold evening. The gnocchi's are a must try!
March 26, 2011|Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful|5|What a wonderful experience! Completely enjoyed everything about this restaurant. We went with another couple and decided to do the food tasting with the wine pairing. While it was an expensive night out, $600 with tip for the 4 of us, we loved the steak tartare, lobster gnocchi, scallops and duck. The service was great and really enjoyed the Botanical cocktail. There cocktails are an interesting twist of cava or wine and liquior. Will definitely be back.
March 26, 2011|An all around wonderful evening,|5|An all around wonderful evening, service and food both top notch. Would definitely return, wish we lived closer. Little 'extras' always add to a meal. Keep up the good work.
March 26, 2011|Dinner, as always, was excellent|5|Dinner, as always, was excellent - attractive and tasty. As I was taking my sister for an evening out to celebrate her recent birthday, Gracie's stepped up to make this an extra special dinner. Tiny silver stars were sprinkled on the table to mark a special occasion, free wine for a toast was sent to us, and a small dessert with candle was provided. Good wishes were extended to my sister throughout the evening too. Such courteous and special touches make Gracie's my restaurant of choice on those evenings when I am attending theater at Trinity Rep Theater.
March 26, 2011|Fabulous Meal|5|Had a great night out with my parents. I love the cheese plate (which I had as an appetizer) and my husband loved the gnocchi which were so soft and delicious. My parents found the mussels and the califlower soup delicious. We ate everything on our plates and couldn't wait to dig into dinner. Dinner came and my dad's eyes almost popped out of his head as the lamb shank landed in front of him. My mom was so excited to dig into the scallops. I found the ribeye delicious and loved all of the components on the dish. My husband cound not stop talking about how delicious the pork two ways was. The chocolate tarrine dessert was a perfect ending to the perfect meal. We talked about how delcious the food was all weekend. Thank you Gracies!

They never rush you! Gracie's is must for us whenever we are in Providence.

Everything was delicious - potato gnocchi, seared tuna, bass, duck and a tasty chocolate dessert, with a few tidbits in between. Free valet and we were surprised with cookies left for us in the car, which topped off a wonderful evening. They get everything right at Gracie's. Highly recommended.
March 12, 2011|Delighting The Customer|5|This restaurant was a real find for us tourists. The food was gourmet. The cauliflower soup with bits of lobster was rich and creamy. The Zephyr poached egg appetizer was an unusual combination but it worked. We had scallops and duck for dinner, followed by creme brulee and all was exquisitely prepared and plated. The home-made beer bread was yummy and the little 'extras' such as sorbet between courses were delightful. Finally, small gifts of cookies were waiting in our car after it was retrieved by the valet. Talk about surprising and delighting the customer! We'll definitely come back here!

The complimentary grapefruit sorbet was outstanding as was the creme brulee. I would not recommend the chocolate torte dessert because it was very dry. We had the only private booth, which is very nice, and the servers were attentive and personable. It's a great place to go for something special. Portions are on the small side.
February 15, 2011|I took my girlfriend to Gracies|5|I took my girlfriend to Gracies for a post valentines dinner. The food was phenomenal, but it was the service and details that really made this a distinguished spot. Not only was the staff attentive but there was always something extra, down to a surprise bag of cookies left in our car by the valet. To those looking for a special occasion or truly fine dining experience, Gracies is a must.
February 15, 2011|Truly Fine Dining|5|"Everything about Gracie's is special, even in a city with a lot of great upscale restaurants. We like to go there for special occasions and are never disappointed. The little extras ""from the chef"" are lovely, and the service could not be better."
February 14, 2011|Out of this world!|5|This was our 4th time there and it is our new favorite restaurant in RI and beyond! Chef's creations are out of this world as far as creativity and taste! Expect fresh and beautifully balanced dishes with tremendous attention to detail and presentation. The ever changing menu features lots of local and seasonal specialties. Service is professional and knowledgeable as one would expect at a establishment of this caliber.

Just when we thought the nice little touches couldn't get any better... we found out the valet had left us cookies! The entire staff at Gracies is keen on details which truly sets the restaurant apart -- it's an entire experience. And well, the food is phenomenal as well!
February 13, 2011|My wife loved her dinner (duck).|4|My wife loved her dinner (duck). My steak was good but not close to the best I ever had for the price. The mix of items on the dinner plate was excellent & all worked well together although we laughed at not knowing exactly what we were eating. The between course pallet cleansers was a nice touch. The service was the best part - attentive without being overbearing & very personable & friendly. If you have never been there - the menu presentation is somewhat hard to decipher & required explanation from the waitstaff...twice...in order to understand it.
February 13, 2011|A night to remember!|5|From start to finish Gracie's was a unbelievable! With every dish being a star. We had a quiet table in the corner which made our Valentine's Day dinner even better, there was even rose petals spinkled on the table. The staff was very knowledgable and friendly. We just loved it!
February 12, 2011|A Disappointment|2|"After reading so many positive reviews of Gracie's we were very disappointed with our visit. The front-of-house and service were seriously ""off"" the night we were there - lots of missed and mixed signals between each other and with us. This made for a rocky start that never really recovered. Granted it was a busy, noisy, Saturday night, but the place has been around long enough to avoid such snafus. The food was generally good - pork two ways was very nice - but the trout dish was quite tiny and not up to speed in terms of flavor. Staff made some efforts to make up for all the problems, but there was a lack of sincerity in the gestures. Perhaps this place is resting on its laurels and in need of a refresher course on hospitality."
February 12, 2011|The food was excellent at|5|The food was excellent at Gracie's! Everything was delicious, even ingredients I don't usually enjoy. The service was wonderful too; the waitstaff was unobtrusive but efficient so we were able to enjoy our meal and still arrive in time for our theater show.
February 11, 2011|Gracie's is the best restaurant.|4|Gracie's is the best restaurant. The menu has a couple options: 3 course prix fix starting at $35, 5 course taste for $70, and the 7 course taste for $90. We got the prix fix and paid a couple dollars more for some of the options. You probably can't go wrong with any appetizer/entree, but the desserts will let you down (good, just not spectacularly good like the previous two courses).

February 5, 2011|Gracie's, without fail, provides|5|Gracie's, without fail, provides an amazing dining experience. Front and back of house work together seemlessly. As I have said before, the single best dish I have ever had (and I've dined at Michelin three-star restaurants) is the slow-cooked egg. The food is creative without being pretentious, and absolutely delicious. I do love their wine list (I am partial to Napa County reds); it offers an excellent selection, but it is not overwhelmingly long.
February 4, 2011|Good from beginning to end|5|This is a really exceptional restaurant. The food? It's just plain good -- and not just a few signature dishes, but everything. Let's face it: a lot of restaurants mail it in on crowd-pleasing appetizers and salads or appetizers, and save the fireworks for a few dishes. Not here: every course is excellent (although I found the desserts good but merely workmanlike). Two things to note when you dine here: 1. Don't depend on the free valet parking. In inclement weather or on busy nights they run out of parking. 2. Ask to sit further back in the restaurant -- window seats here are bright, noisy, and colder than the rest of the restaurant in the winter. Attend to these details and you will have a fabulous evening.
February 4, 2011|My husband and I did the 5|5|My husband and I did the 5 course tasting paired with wine and it was absolutely amazing! This was our second visit to Gracie's and we had a fabulous experience each time. This is by far our favorite restaurant! We can't wait to go back!!
February 4, 2011|The food was fantastic --|4|The food was fantastic -- the flavors and presentation inventive and delicious. The two amuse-bouches offered, however, were uninteresting -- superfluous. Wine service was lovely, the server presenting the bottles before pouring our single glasses. But the clunky glassware detracted from the experience. But the food is the star here. Come for the food.
February 4, 2011|My wife and I went to Gracie's|5|My wife and I went to Gracie's with high expectations, and we were not disappointed. We tried the three course restaurant week menu, with wine pairings. Chef Varga (whom we met on our way out) put out inventive dishes where ingredients blended perfectly. In Boston, you usually have to pay much more for this type of dining experience. The wine pairings were very impressive. A malbec made a fabulous match with the confit duck, and a mucat cut perfectly through the creaminess of the creme bule. This is a place that should not be missed in a visit to the area. Including hotel in providence and gas, it was still cheaper than going to any of the top restaurants in Boston (non-restaurant week price for the menu is abouft the same).
February 4, 2011|Gracie's is a Gem|5|We get to Gracie's whenever we can. Its proximity to Trinity Rep is a plus. The restaurant is a gem. *Fabulous food! *Attentive (but not hovering) waitstaff *Very nice wine list *Relaxed and intimate decor * Oh, and did I mention fabulous food?
February 2, 2011|Gracie's has offered my friends|5|Gracie's has offered my friends and I the best food that we have ever had in Providence. The beer bread with the honey glaze is the type of bread that you could just keep on asking for - even if you have already finished dessert. Try it.

January 29, 2011|Multiple courses for one of 2 diner|4|Loved the food didn't like the fact that only one of 2 diners could have a 5 or 7 course dinner without the other having the same amount of courses. I understand why this is, but it's forcing me to come w/o my wife...any thoughts?
January 29, 2011|A Grace note in Downtown Providence|5|The best Restaurant week dining we experienced. From the minute we entered and asked for a quiet table to the extra little desserts compliments of the house, I felt Gracie's was courting us. Yet I didn't feel fawned over in an uncomfortableway. The staff seemed to enjoyo their work and the food was enlightened!
January 27, 2011|Great food! Ambience not so much.|4|The food was great! The service was ok, but it was really noisy - I guess it was Restaurant Week and they're really busy - and we were stuck in an awkward table.
January 26, 2011|Wow !!!|5|We went there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. We had the 7 course chef tasting. It was fantastic. Gracie's brought us some champagne to start the night on the house and some apps that were stellar. We got a chance to meet the Executive Chef who was very friendly. Valet parking was a breeze and they left some amazing chocolate chip cookies on the seats – great touch to an amazing evening. If you haven’t tried this place, you are missing out. Prices were fantastic for a restaurant of this caliber. We would give it a 6 out of 5 – excellent job!!

January 25, 2011|Our group choose Gracie's|5|"Our group choose Gracie's for the Winter Restaurant Week menu. The selection was very impressive and we each were able to find something to select. The Gnocchi with Brussel Sprouts appetizer was quite tasty and enjoyed by all. We appreciated the service and presentation of the food at the table. Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about the menu and wines. Kitchen also sends out a ""taste"" and intermezzo as part of the meal...Nice touch. Finally, if we did not like the selection of the Restuarant Week menu, the restaurant offers prix fixe options with 3 courses for $35.00 - Phenomenal value!!"

January 14, 2011|If Gracies isn't the best|5|If Gracies isn't the best in Rhode Island it certainly is in the top 5. Always excellant, creative dishes, friendly service, good wine list and valet parking. Their 3 course pre-theatre menu is great because the whole menu is available. This restaurant continues to exceed my expectations
January 13, 2011|Chef's got talent|5|What a talented kitchen. Gracie's rivals some of the best NYC restaurants. Just outstanding. I can't wait for my next excuse to go to providence so I can dine there once again. I have been there three times and each meal has been exceptional. They need to add a few New Zealand Sauv Blancs to the wine list is my only suggestion.

December 31, 2010|We were looking for a nice|5|We were looking for a nice place to have a New Year's eve dinner. We saw Gracie's reviews and got a reservation but didn't know what to expect. If you want a la carte dining, this is not the place for you. The New Year's Eve offering was a fixed price menu with 6 amazing courses. We had 2 or 3 choices from each course. It was all excellent - seared scallops, lamb chops, chestnut soup with pate, mushroom ravioli, bass, etc. - and the portion size was perfect. The dessert was great too - we both had the orange flan (it wasn't called that but basically that's what it was).We ordered a bottle of one of our favorite Pinot Grigios, however that night they offered pairings with each course if you wanted it.We will definately go back!
December 30, 2010|As a former Rhode Islander,|4|As a former Rhode Islander, I'd been wanting to try Gracie's for a while. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant features unusual entrees prepared in unusual ways--at least, to this diner. The food was tasty, the service good, the Delirium Tremens plentiful. I would suggest ordering some combination of the prix fixe menu to keep the bill slightly lower. Recommended!

My husband had the mussels appetizer and could stop talking about how great it was. Had the ribeye for dinner and it was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating it....I ate the whole thing (a rarity for me). My husband had a lamb dish which he also loved. Dessert was a bit of a let down after such a wonderful meal. We had a peanut butter dessert and it was bland. But overall the meal was fabulous and I would definately return.

It was a pre-theatre dinner and our server inquired if we were going the the theatre and the time of our show. Without being rushed, he monitored our time to make certain we were able to finish our meal and get to the theatre on time. Also, the Martini's were the best ever. We will definitely return.

Very attentive but not hovering. Loved getting new silverware for each course--a forgotten piece at many restaurants. The 3-course prix fix was fantastic. Sweetbreads were done to perfection. Each dish was creative. Crispy brussel sprouts made the first course gnocchi dish. Cookies in the car for the ride home was a pleasant surprise. No complaints. Would recommend it to all who like creative cuisine and great service.

December 16, 2010|This restaurant never ceases|5|This restaurant never ceases to amaze me. The 3 course Prix Fixe menu for 30 dollars is the best dining value in the region. I almost feel guilty paying so little since the food and experience are so outstanding. Reasonable drinks. Well prepared food. Amuse bouche before the meal, a sampling between the appetizer and main course, sorbet after the entree and complementary macaroon after the dessert. Plus the valet leaves warm cookies on your console when you pick up your car. Not a meal but a wonderful dining experience.

The desserts were fabulous, especially the peanut butter cremeux! Wine pairing were very good.

The Parsnip soup and Beet Salad apps were so original and flavorful. Our entrees, Duck and Scallops, again were delicious and contained really interesting touches, like chopped Brussel sprouts with the scallops. We were too full for dessert and took home our hand packed macaroons, which were soooo good. A special acknowledgement to the wait staff who were warm, friendly and knowledgeable. A great dining experience !!

December 10, 2010|I was entertaining friends|5|I was entertaining friends from out of town and decided to give Gracies a try given the many wonderful reviews. Gracies lived up to the hype. My friends are food snobs, so it tends to be stressful choosing a restaurant that will please their discriminating palate. They loved every bite and have asked to return to Gracies when visiting again.

Reservations at 5pm mean 5pm----don't show up a minute early because the valet at the door will not let you in -or- valet your car. So if you're trying to allow for Rte 95 traffic and arrive early for a drink-FORGET IT and just drive around the city until 5pm EXACTLY. Because of this we will probably not return.

Somehow, however, he got behind and we were scrambling at the end to get our check, and we didn't have time for dessert. The people at the table next to us came in after we did, got served before we did, ate their dessert, and still had plenty of time to settle their bill and arrive at the theatre on time. What could have been an incredible experience for my daughter and me was just ""all right"" because of this problem. When we came back after the play to pick up our dessert, everyone seemed very puzzled as to why we were there. Another couple had the same problem. The desserts were nowhere near as good at home."

Gracie's offers three ways of dining - a la carte, prix fixe, and tasting menus.Serving is somewhat leisurely although geared to getting a table to the theater on time. A parsnip soup was sweet and filled with little dumplings, a roasted beet salad was also excellent. Two fish entrees - Striped bass and trout were excellent although potatoes accompanying the later were underdone. All in all a delightful experience in a beautiful setting.
November 18, 2010|Service staff was very on|4|Service staff was very on it and efficient without hovering, very good at making sure we had a great dining experience. Also made sure to keep track of time for us and paced our dishes so we made it to theater unhurriedly. (she started the evening by asking which show we were seeing at what time!) The roasted rabbit was excellent, creme brulee as well, though perhaps a trifle on the large side after a 3 course meal. This is the second great staff experience I've had. My only complaint is with the closeness of the tables. I felt as though the table adjacent were our new best friends and there was no way to not listen to their conversation as one of the diners was facing ours. Wished we'd asked for a different table.
November 13, 2010|Reservation was for 8pm. Seated|2|Reservation was for 8pm. Seated promptly, then service slowed to a halt after we gave our orders. We did not leave the restaurant until after 10pm. I had the butternut squash soup for an appetizer (which arrived after we had been at the table for close to an hour). It just seemed a bit sweet with no real body behind it. The trout lacked real pizzaz as well. It should have been spectacular considering it took more than an hour and a half to come to the table after we sat down! We didn't want to wait another half-hour or forty-five minutes for dessert, so signaled one of the servers as soon as we were done with the main course. Our main server was at the table so rarely we thought he may have gone off shift! Big disappointment.

The venison was perfectly executed and rested on a bed of the creamiest and tastiest polenta -- EVER. The little treats from the kitchen throughout the meal and the end-of-dinner macaroons were perfect touches. The chocolate chip cookies that the valet left for us were a nice little late-night snack. Someone at the table next to me had the foi gras appetizer and would not stop talking about it the entire time that she ate -- I'll have to go back and try it!

Although the food was very good, I did not find the chef's choices exceptionally exciting. Two courses were featured around scallops, which I found disappointing. The portions were tiny, but to be expected from this particular type of dining. At $90 per person, I did not feel it was worth the value. I wish I had ordered off the menu as the choices there looked more intriguing. The waitstaff was excellent, explaining each course in detail. They were very generous, letting us sample wines before ordering them. I highly recommend Gracies, but I would forgo the tasting menu.

The water refills and bread (4 choices) never stopped coming. Amuse Bouche and Grapefruit palate cleansers to boot. Elegant not stuffy and edging haute cuisine without seeming over done. The salad greens with blue cheese crumbles, the scallops and the trout were all prepared perfectly. Desert was rather small, yet very satisfying pumpkin cheesecake with surprise cranberry topping.

The cheese plate was probably the best we've ever had, not so much for the cheese itself but because of the pairing of the cheeses with the perfect little accompaniments (not just candied nuts and grapes!). Service was very good in all respects but one: our cocktails took more than 30 minutes to arrive (and the restaurant wasn't busy), and our entrees were served at least 10 minutes prior to the wine.

Which was our second target destination.. Cost us about 50 a person with the price fixe menu with appetizer , dinner and dessert... Food was inventive and definitely at the foodie level. My wife was miffed there was all her favorite farm animals on the menu however I quickly pointed out four or five seafood and a veggie offering as well. The gnocchi, pumpkin soup, beet salad were fab , the duck breast excellent, the halibut nice, the veggie dish wasn't much for $24.... Great homemade breads, good looking wines, need to expand their fine tequila offerings though... We will go back again.

The kitchen has the unique ability to bring each and every flavor through in each dish. Subtle and bold ingredients alike, everything is balanced. Last night we each had the three course: gnocchi and greens; halibut and trout; bittersweet chocolate and cheese plate. Nothing I would not order again. Service: start to finish friendly, prompt, professional and competent. We accidentally ruined our wine list (romantic candles, paper menu- use your imagination). Our server was completely unruffled. She handled it with humor and made us feel so comfortable with what we thought would be a faux pas. This is the entire

October 30, 2010|We had a WONDERFUL dining|5|We had a WONDERFUL dining experience @ Gracie's, from the moment we entered the restaurant 'til the moment we walked out the door. I made a note on our Open Table reservation that we were celebrating a 40th b'day & the hostess immediately asked who's birthday it was & paid special attention to that person. We had complimentary birthday champagne (very good!). The food at Gracie's is excellent & we enjoyed every bite, especially the roasted squash soup, the mussels, the gnocchi, the soft-poached egg with pork belly & grits, the rib eye, the breads, all of the desserts (!!), & our final treat of PB&J french meringues. Cocktails and wine were perfect. All of the servers were engaging and very good -- no hovering & just-right attentiveness. A+!

Food, for the most part was excellent, imaginatively presented and flavored, although one entree was excessively salted (sea salt which is strong). We enjoyed the ""amuse bouche,"" palate cleansing sorbet and finishing macaroons at the end. Wait staff were very attentive. Noise level was a little high due to poor planning for the acoustics. Still, worth repeating."

The first time was last month for my birthday and it was a wonderful evening, outstanding food and service, truly a memorable evening. On this occasion we were celebrating our anniversary and although the food was very good, the service was very disappointing. The only criticism about the food was that my husband's halibut was overcooked and dry, surprising given the level and quality of food that comes from the kitchen. Our server was one of the worst servers I have experienced at a fine dining restaurant. He had an excuse for everything and seemed distracted and overwhelmed with attending to his other tables. This was also a memorable experience, just one sadly I don't care to remember.

We had the wine pairings and the wine would come after the food, one time they forgot it all together until I mentioned something, once they filled the glass instead of giving us the amount for a pairing, it went on and on. I was really disappointed in the service, they used to be great.

Arrived early, waited in bar for 15 minutes beyond res time but given lovely table (albeit with wide view of service area) decorated for a special occasion. Several menu items and wines not available. Approach to menu a bit confusing, as tasting menu items are not explained, ""chef makes what he wants."" Given lateness and lack of insight on tasting menus, opted for 3-course prix fixe with supplements for some dishes. Loved the field green salad with Maytage bleu cheese, corn soup, haibut with vegetable terrine, cheese plate with house-made accompaniments and lemon tart. Pasta with sausage not so successful. Will return on non-WaterFire nite and hope for better-paced service."

Each dish was so thoughtfully prepared and executed to perfection. Portion sizes were bang on too. The service was also some of the best we have ever experienced. The staff at Gracie's really works together to ensure you are well looked after. Empty plates were promptly cleared and yet it never felt as though the servers were hovering around you. My only regret is that we live 8 hours from Gracie's because this is definitely a restaurant I would visit again and again to see what new seasonal dishes the chef puts on the menu next!

I had put a note in my reservation about celebrating a birthday while dining there and from the hostess to the server, they treated the birthday guest with everything I would have hoped for their celebration. Everyone wished them a happy birthday and we ended with a little candle in the desert. The food came a little faster than we had thought it would, but we guessed that was because they serve so many theatre attendees. I would highly recommend it to friends!

September 14, 2010|We had been looking forward|2|We had been looking forward to dining at Gracie’s. Unfortunately, our experience was terribly disappointing . My meal was not what I specifically ordered. I ordered a rib eye steak with the sauce on the side. It arrived smothered in a heavy garlic sauce. By the time our waitress returned, it was too late to return the dish. My wife’s cod was fresh but the preparation just ordinary. The gnocchi appetizer was the best part of the meal, unusual and delicious –unlike the mussels which were somewhat dry and lacked the chorizo flavor described on the menu. The restaurant was pretentious and the menu pricing confusing. The stated Prix Fixe is for a few items only. Most of the appetizers and entrees have an “up charge” some, substant
September 14, 2010|Great meal... the four breads|5|Great meal... the four breads offered were all interesting especially the raisin and fennel. They were very accommodating. We were a party of 7 that contracted to 3. The gnocchi (lobster) was superb as was the fresh gazpacho. We had ribeye and scallops for the main course. Both were exceptional. Dessert was also terrific, stone fruits with lavender ice cream and lemon tart with chamomile ice creams. The wine list was a C plus. More Oregon Pinots and more creative Chards. Service was warm but slightly slow given the small number of patrons at the time. We would recommend Gracies highly.

The beef (steak) was very nicely done, a bit of your standard steak fair but cooked well. The skate wing was very nice and so was the duck. The desserts were out of this world, very light and refreshing and unique combinations of ingredients. The desserts were well conceived and all the components tasted well together in your mouth. Many restaurants try to be overly creative for creative sake and miss the mark. Gracie's is not that at all. Definately would go back the next time I visit RI.

September 1, 2010|wow, best meal in years!|5|Stayed the night in Providence just to eat here based on reviews here and elsewhere. Honestly one of the best meals I have had in years. I am not the most hard core of foodies but eat at 4+ star places a few times a month. This place is killer - unique and interesting menu, delightful use of ingredients, just lovely. I can't wait to find an excuse to go back to Providence to eat here again, and again. Worth every penny (does cost a lot of pennies, though)

I plan some lame attempts to replicate the green gazpacho at home but won't even try with the local cod; perfectly cooked. We're not big dessert people but we ate every bite of ours (lemon tart/bittersweet chocolatekind of a fancy smores; interesting!). I enjoyed the old-fashioned drink menu espec. the cotton gin. There were tasty extras too like a watermelon/basil oil drink and a bite of grapefruit sorbet between courses. Even the breads, baked on premises, were unbelievably delicious. A great place to celebrate a special occasion, or just stimulate your tastebuds.
August 31, 2010|I rate Gracie's among top|5|I rate Gracie's among top ten restaurants I've had the pleasure of visiting. I recently moved to Providence from San Francisco. Gracie's could easily hold its own in that city. Friends were visiting from New York and I wanted to show-off Providence. Gracie's had been highly recommended. This place not only lived up to the recommendation, but exceeded it. One of my guest requires gluten food. I mentioned this when I placed the reservation. Not only were the servers notified, but the Kitchen staff as well! The seven courses with wine pairing was exceptional. As you can tell, the evening was thoroughly enjoyable. Don't miss a dinner at Gracie's
August 31, 2010|After years of having a great|4|After years of having a great experience at Gracie's, we had one that was subpar. I hope this was an aberration. The main reason was our server, who doesn't have the grace that is the theme of Gracie's. He had an edge from the start, and it just got worse. Let me give you and example (from a series of maddening instances). We were doing a chef's tasting with wine pairings. When one of the wine pairings didn't work out, he said it was his second choice anyway, but just walked away instead of bringing his first choice. Perhaps because of this unpleasantness, some of food didn't seem up to par, the fist time in several visits. I will say that the support staff and the teamwork they exhibited was excellent.

The service was perfect, the food was creative and fresh, and the ambiance was warm and beautiful. I ordered a fresh crab and vegetable gazpacho: a small, lovely turine of fresh veggies+crab arrived in a very big bowl. I asked, ""This is gazpacho?"" The waitperson then poured the most divine chilled vegetable puree over the stack and I went to town with the combination of flavors! It was perfect. My sea bass was also delicious and our guests who ordered mussels, duck, and scallops were all devoured with passion. Great food, service, wine list, and ambiance at Gracie's!"

From the fine tomatoes -fresh from the vine- to the tidbits from the chef that were delivered between courses, It was truly memorable and we can't wait to go back over the next 4 years, as we just deposited our child at Brown for his freshman year. Gracie's has a wonderful space that is inviting and large, but intimate. Jon and the crew, were there for us every step of the way on our wonderful and tasty experience at Gracie's!

The proportions were perfect, and each dish was beautifully presented. The flavor combinations were complex and delicious. For example, homemade gnocchi with lobster as an appetizer, confit de canard with grilled plums and small chippole onions, and lemon tart with blueberries and lavender ice cream. The bread, which was mostly made on premises (a local artisinal bakery supplied one variety), was fabulous, including a honey-glazed wheat that was a personal favorite. The atmosphere was quite romantic with candlelight and white tablecloths, aand the service was friendly and polite.

August 4, 2010|Had a one-day layover in Providence|2|Had a one-day layover in Providence and did some research on local eateries. Gracies was well rated by many/most Open Table diners. Wife and I were disappointed. The breads served at the table were overly salty. Amuse bouche looked like an afterthought--a marcona almond, a nib of a piece of cheese, etc. Not much imagination. My mussels with chorizo and smoked tomato were decent, but nothing fantastic. My wife and I both ordered the duck. Mine came out much rarer than I liked and ordered. The grilled plum accompaniment tasted burned and had a chemical-like flavor. Yecch. Service was poor--waiter took wine list off table before we had a chance to look at it. Once I got it, waiter poured a tasting and was never seen again.

The hostess and servers each separately wished us a happy anniversary. When we sat down, they poured us half glasses of prosecco on the house to toast our anniversary, which was a really nice touch. My husband loved his poached egg on grits appetizer, stating it was the best appetizer he had ever had, and he is not one for overstatements. I had the amazing lobster gnocci. The duck and lamb entrees and dessert were very good but maybe not as stellar as the appetizers. The other nice touches were an amuse bouche pre-appetizer and palate cleanser pre-entree, mini macaroons when the check came, and bag of mini cookies waiting in our car.

The wines were wonderful and the food was excellently prepared, original, fun, and delicious. My only negative comment is that, at $75 + $30 for the wine pairing, this tasting menu would be hard for me to order again, since the portions were rather small (not a bad thing when you have 5 or 7 courses) and Gracie's has a wonderful 3 course meal with full-sized entrees for $30. I just feel that the tasting menu is a bit overpriced. That being said, the food at Gracies is top-notch and well worth whatever price you pay. It's a real find in Providence and a MUST for anyone who likes wonderful, unique, and delicious food in a fun atmosphe

Everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - ranged from ""excellent"" to ""took my breath away"".I can't say enough about this place, so I'll just say this - it was simply the best meal I ever had. Go there and put yourselves in their hands - let them WOW YOU! You'll never forget it."
June 5, 2010|The food was amazing - especially|5|The food was amazing - especially the cheese plate. We have a group of three and ordered off the prix fixe menu - everything we had was great. I had sent an advance note that I had gluten issues and they made a special dessert just for me. How often does that happen? We had dinner here before a show at the PPAC and valet parked our car - so convenient. Even the late parking person gave you a treat of chocolate chip cookies when you picked up your car. We will be back.
June 4, 2010|Gracie's was outstanding.|5|Gracie's was outstanding. We moved to New England 4 years ago from the NY/Philly area and have been consistently disappointed with the dining choices here. However, Gracie's exceeded our expectations and more. Easily the best meal I have had in New England in the past 4 years. Highly recommended.

May 28, 2010|Our experience did not meet|2|Our experience did not meet our expectations and was certainly not consistent with our prior dines at this restaurant. Asked 4 people 5 times for bread and got excuses until the food was cold. Took 25 minutes before bread finally arrived. Asked for information on the cheese selection. Waiter promised the information and then did not return for half an hour. When he did come by he went to check on the cheese list and returned to tell us that it was against the restaurant policy to tell the customers what cheeses are being served for the evening. Salad was poor. Beef was excellent. Fish was mediocre.
May 23, 2010|The food was very good especially|4|The food was very good especially the Pacific Halibut and Prime Ribeye. I especially enjoyed the lemon pudding cake for dessert. Gracie's is fine dining with a nice, warm atmosphere. We were a group of 11 and Gracie's was well prepared for our group. We were seated immediately and orders were taken in a timely manner. Service was very good. Overall experience was very positive. I would highly recommend Gracie's for a large group or intimate dining experience.
May 22, 2010|I have a cow's milk allergy,|3|I have a cow's milk allergy, so no butter or cream for me. The server didn't offer to speak with the chef to accomodate my allergy at all, just steered me toward the one dish on the menu that met my dietary requirements. It was okay - the fish was done perfectly, but the dish wasn't very flavorful overall. I was disappointed with the service and probably won't go back.

May 4, 2010|Gracie's lives up to its reputation|5|Gracie's lives up to its reputation every time we dine there. Delicious, beautiful food, first class service (particularly helpful to help us make curtain time). Their prix-fixe dinner scheme is brilliant - 3-course for $30 base price. Most places have 2 or 3 apps, entrees and dessert and usually the less expensive type items. What's brilliant is that you can choose off the entire menu. There is a surcharge for the higher priced items but they explain how it works all upfront. It fair and reasonable. Will definitely go back!
May 1, 2010|Every dish was cooked and|5|Every dish was cooked and presented expertly. The Parsnip soup was great, as was the seared fois gras appetizer. Service was performed in a classic manner, a bit more formally than many of today's new restaurants. Kudos all around.

French for tiny between course appetite stimulator. We've had a couple of celebrations and I love the way they greet and acknowledge the occasion and the complimentary sparkling wine is an added touch.

The atmosphere was cozy and romantic. Perfect for a romantic birthday. Each member of staff wished my wife a ""Happy Birthday"" and went out of their way to make it a very special night. The Rhode Island Littlenecks were to die for and our Prime Ribeye was cooked to perfection. Absolutely fantastic !!! Highly recommended!!! Best dining in Providence !!!"
April 24, 2010|What a pleasant surprise!|5|What a pleasant surprise! We usually dine in Boston (closer) but met friends who live in Providence here. Boston caliber, not Boston prices! Decor was a little cheesy for my taste (I don't love the star theme) but the menu was lovely, execution was on point, and service was excellent. I'd be happy to return.
April 23, 2010|I loved the dinning experience|4|I loved the dinning experience at Gracie's. We took the 5 course chef's menu, and it was excellent. My favorite course was the scallops with parsnip puree, little pieces of ham, herbs and other root veggies. The wine pairing was superb with French wines. I forgot the exact description of the courses, but they were something like...(1) pre-apertizer: pickled asparagus on yellow peppercorn puree and local greens, (2)salmon sashimi with crisp capers, greens, and some root veggies, (3) house made gnocchi with beans, peas, carrots- it does not sound very good, but it was an outstanding dish full of flavor, (4)the scallops with parsnip puree, (5)duck really amazingly cooked on carrot puree, a wine reduction and other stuff...a mixed berry sorbet

Service, food and ambience were wonderful. The menu offered a lot of different dishes which we enjoyed. They also have options for dining that make the cost reasonable. We would definitely return to Gracie's and would recommend it to friends."

April 16, 2010|We saw the menu online for|4|We saw the menu online for Gracie's and I wasn't sure I would enjoy it. We got there and it was INCREDIBLE! The food was extremely surprising. The portions were very large for the type of restaurant I thought Gracie's was. A bit pricey, but if you want a great dinner or celebrating, this is the place to be!!
April 10, 2010|We had hoped for a good dinner|5|We had hoped for a good dinner but Gracie's exceeded expectations on all levels. Everything was well prepared, but what made each dish special was the use of unexpected elements. Ricotta Gnochi was made more interesting with parsley and lemon. The fois gras ravioli highlighted the perfectly prepared duck breast. The service was friendly without being overbearing. The wine-by-the-glass choices were inexpensive but interesting. Prices were certainly reasonable and compared favorably to similar quality restaurants in cities that are better known for their food scenes. Providence is fortunate to have this restaurant.
April 9, 2010|It was an amazing dining experience|5|It was an amazing dining experience. I could see how much attention is paid to ensure a first class presentation. For example, the waiter is a trained and knowledgable chef who was able to guide us through the meal and answer all questions. Jon also made us feel very comfortable and jovial. The chefs attention to local and fresh and the best ingredients made the food outstanding. The portions were just right. The foie GRAS changed my world. Finally the atmosphere was intimate and allowed for conversation that really enhanced the experience.
April 3, 2010|The food was very overpriced|4|The food was very overpriced for a la carte items and the additional prices added on the prix fixe. I would have expected bigger portions on the side items for all entrees. $39 for lamb and a few boiling onions!!! I can not imagine how ripped off I would have felt getting a tasting menu. On the other hand, the food was on the top of what this city has to offer. The dining room got very loud and it was hard to hear everyone at the table even though there were only four of us. The waiter took the check before we left the table, which was completely inappropriate and the table next to ours received something from the kitchen (that they did not order) before the meal that we did not. These are two of my biggest pet peeves about dining out.
April 3, 2010|Gracie's is one of a kind!|5|Gracie's is one of a kind! We have been there a handful of times, and every time we come out loving it even more. On this occasion, we were celebrating our engagement, and they helped to make the evening quite memorable and wonderful. We had flowers sent to the restaurant ahead of time, and they said if there were any difficulties with the delivery, they would go out themselves to make sure flowers were on the table! You are treated like kings and queens while dining there, and their food is the best in providence! We recommend the chef's dinner (several course meals paired with wines) as our favorite. Overall, Gracie's has outdone themselves yet again, and we will certainly be visiting them soon again for our next special occasion.

The restaurant is nicely decorated with a lot of indirect lighting and candles, with a small bar area cordoned off by a half wall. The food and wait staff were excellent, although we did not connect with our primary server. I had the 5-course tasting menu, paired with wine, while my wife ordered a la carte from the menu. It was an enjoyable evening, although somewhat pricey.

March 18, 2010|Although the cuisine was excellent|3|Although the cuisine was excellent - several 'amuse bouche' between courses is a nice touch - the ambience was spoiled by the noise from the bar area. Eaten at Gracies many times in the past since they moved from Federal Hill. It was a very intimate, quiet - and pleasant - experience. A very romantic setting. Not so this time with the crowd at the bar and was surprised to see so many empty tables this time. I guess I'm not the only one to get the impression that the dining experience here has peaked. Too bad noting the high quality of the cuisine and service.
March 12, 2010|A very good dining experience.|4|A very good dining experience. Food is french and so sometimes very rich. Some things were a bit over salted, but overall very good. Very accommodating with food changes. Wine suggestion fell a bit flat, but was okay because the wine I was going to choose was more expensive than the one they suggested. I would recommend this place for a date and suggest the tasting menu.

The beet salad, skate fish, scallops, foie gras, cheese plate were wonderful. Our server was efficient, however she needed to smile. She was not very personable; it seemed like she considered her job painful. However, both owners who checked in with us were very helpful and attentive. I would highly recommend Gracie's. Regarding the prixe fix, just beware there are additional supplements for many of the items on the $30.00 prixe fix menu, which will increase your final check total.

My friend and I were treated (as my future daughter-in-law said) as if we were somebody who was somebody. Can't get more special than that! The valet was right there to take the car- the girl at the desk was speedy and very welcoming as she took our coats and took us to our seats. Our waiter was superb and incredibly helpful! He was so easy to talk to and was always there without being intrusive.He had no problem explaining the way the prices were set up two times and made it easy for us to ask to repeat information. The RI Little Necks appetizer was the dish we raved about the most though all was excellent. The creme brulee and pot de creme were to die for! Highest ratings!

One of the real nice things about doing this was that each course was a nice surprise.

Great menu (changes with the seasons), and an extensive wine list - I'm not much of a ""connoisseur,"" but they seemed to have a very good selection. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable (but not obtrusive), and everyone works together to make your experience that much more enjoyable. Pricey, but a great place for a special dinner with that special someone."
February 13, 2010|An absolutely amazing dining|5|An absolutely amazing dining experience here. Everything you here about the superior food and service is absolutely true. The whole night we were constantly waited on by the entire staff even though the place was packed we were always immediatetly taken care of. We did the 5 course with wine pairing that was customized to what we enjoy which was spectacular. The only drawback was the high cost of the 5 course but then again with the prix fixe menu for 30 for a 3 course you can always select that opton or an entree itself. The wine pairings perfectly complemented each dish and overall the experince was superb definetly the best in rhode island so far. I highly recommend it!

I noted that were celebrating when I made the reservation online and was surprised that everyone from the host to the waitress made a point to wish me a happy day. They gave us complimentary champagne and brought a candle out in my dessert - it was very sweet. The atmosphere is very cozy with low lighting. The wine that was recommended was wonderful and relatively inexpensive. The food was incredible - I had a very difficult deciding what to get b/c it all sounded wonderful. I highly recommend the prix-fixe option. I am not sure if there was much in terms of vegetarian options though. I am dying to go back there again as soon as I can to try the other menus item!
February 6, 2010|I brought my wife to Providence|5|I brought my wife to Providence from north suburban Boston as an overnight treat. We saw a matinee at Trinity Rep and then dined at Gracie's. I was expecting great things and I was not disappointed. We were greeted by a friendly staff on our arrival, treated to attentive service, and dined on delicious food. I especially enjoyed the potato gnocchi appetizer which I'm told is a signature dish. The little treats were a nice touch. The dining room was warm and inviting. The staff is clearly well trained to a high standard. I am very pleased to have chosen Gracie's for this occasion and we are eager to return.
February 6, 2010|When I dine at Gracie's I|5|When I dine at Gracie's I order the seven-course chef's tasting; and, as always, I'm glad I do. The recent tasting we had was spectacular from the opening beet salad through the cheese course. It was two-plus hours of embarrassingly delicious fare (does anyone deserve to eat so well?). Most notable (as always) was foie gras course, the seafood course (an amazingly sweet scallop preparation), and the red meat course (which included a melt-in-your mouth short rib). To my tastebuds the smoky-bacon infused gnocchi we had at Gracie's ranked second only to Thomas Keller's French-styled gnocchi that I had once in California. Impressive was the timing of the courses: never did we feel rushed, never did we feel waiting. Attentive waitstaff too
February 5, 2010|Gracie's was the best dining|5|Gracie's was the best dining experience I have ever had. The food was fantastic; they feature several dishes that you dont find in the majority of upscale restaurants (e.g. foie gras, sweetbreads) at reasonable prices. The prix fix menu and tasting menus seems to offer a great value. In between courses, my girlfriend and I were surprised by small tastings that the chef used to showcase what was good (carrot & celeriac puree w/pickled onion, then an orange sherbet as a palate cleanser, then a tray of cookies that came with the check). All in all, it was a great dinner and you get what you pay for.

After five minutes, we were asked if we wanted a drink which is when we asked for the wine list (we were given menus when were seated). When the entrees were delivered, 2 of them were placed in front of the wrong people. When the servers were informed, a comical game of ""musical plates"" ensued and a simple plate switch become more complicated than it should have. There were a few other issues with service.

We will certainly go back when next in the city for any reason.

When the waitress heard we had theater tickets (Anthony Bourdain) she had several ideas about how to fit in the three courses in the time we had before the show. The option we chose was to return to the restaurant after the show and have our dessert at that time. What a fabulous idea! We returned to Gracie's after the show and had dessert and a glass of wine. This allowed us to spend the time after the show enjoying the surroundings of Gracies instead of sitting in traffic waiting to get out of Providence. It was a delightful evening.

A friend recalled it from a previous location and when I checked the menu on line and learned they try to use local produce and seasonal offerings I was enticed. Gracie's didn't disappoint. Not only was the service impeccable (maybe a shade to attentive) but each course was beautifully presented at the appropriate time and each taste was unique. My friend and I tasted each other's appetizers, entre's and desserts (we ordered the pre fix 3 course offering for $30)and each course met or exceeded our expectation. The manager, Anter, came to chat and was genuinely interested in us and our experience. All is all, a great dining experience. I can't wait to go back with my husband!

The service was impeccable as my guest and the server, Morgan, engaged in conversation about their trips to France, both visiting the same region. The chianti from Tuscany was a superb wine, and the beer bread, along with the other two choices of pains were very tasty. The conversation and overall atmosphere lent itself to a most pleasant evening.

December 11, 2009|Gracie's is without a doubt|5|Gracie's is without a doubt the BEST restaurant in Providence! From the moment you arrive, you are greeted warmly and enveloped in an atmosphere of both elegance and celebration. The chef's gifts to diners are always top notch, the food is beautifully presented and delicious and the staff effortlessy attend to your every need. The maitre'd is superb, with an amazing ability to remember customers and ensure that they have a wonderful experience. Forget what you hear about any other place--Gracie's is the place to go and the one that sends the standard for dining in Rhode Island.
December 8, 2009|great restaurant with individualize|5|great restaurant with individualized attention by your server. the food was great, probably the best in providence. The service on the other hand was exceptional. haven't had a better service from other restaurants in a while. overall a phenomenal place, a must visit place in providence
December 5, 2009|Gracie's is always wonderful.|5|Gracie's is always wonderful. The food is amazing, each of the four of us had something different and we all loved our meals. The service could not be more attentive and kind. The experience, as always, is really a treat.
December 4, 2009|My husband and I are foodies|5|My husband and I are foodies and spend WAY too much money on going out to dinner - Gracie's was the absolute hands down best experience we have had in MANY years of going to dinner. The food was unbelievable, the service was IMPECCABLE, the general manager even spent time with us to ensure the experience was the best. Gracie's should be commended. Its hard in this economy to drop money on going out to dinner but Gracie's makes it WORTH it and you feel like you are thanked for sharing the evening with them. I will absolutely be back & will recommend to others!!!! I even got the owners email so I could personally thank them for the night.
December 4, 2009|"Gracies,
The moment we arrived"|5|"Gracies, The moment we arrived I sensed something special was about to happen and it did. From the chef's complimentary appetizers and breads through our main course of Nantucket Bay scallops the meal was exquisite. We accepted our waiter's offer to return to the restaurant to have desert after attending a performance of The Christmas Carol at Trinity. Needless to say the home made deserts were superb and topped off the evening. What made this evening so ""Special"" was the wonderful people who work at this fine restaurant. The service we receivedfrom everyone was more than exceptional. This evening my sweetheart and I shared in one of the finest dining experinces in the city of Providence and I felt I should share it with you."
December 4, 2009|Gracie's is the perfect place|5|Gracie's is the perfect place for a lovely dinner. The food was excellent - we did the prix fix wit wine pairings - wonderful! The service was a little too solicitous for my taste - felt hovering. That was probably because we had an early dinner before Trinity. There were very few people there. I hope the economy isn't hurting this great restaurant.

November 14, 2009|Excellent restaurant. Pretty|4|Excellent restaurant. Pretty good value. Beat salad was very strong. Duck and lamb shank both very good as were desserts. Restaurant does a good job.
November 14, 2009|The food was excellent; better|4|The food was excellent; better than anticipated as I had very recently experienced superb fine dining in NY and did not expect the food to match up to that level. The pumpkin soup was outstanding! Our main courses were very good and the desserts were presented beautifully as well as tasting wonderfully. We will return with family members or friends next time who also enjoy good food!

November 11, 2009|fabulous all round dining|5|fabulous all round dining experience. food and service were both excellent. the setting was upscale yet still intimate. the chef hits the nail on the head with the flavors of the season. a can't miss for anyone visiting Providence.
November 7, 2009|Another wonderful evening|5|Another wonderful evening at Gracie's. They go the extra mile on all levels!
November 6, 2009|The service is wonderful -|4|The service is wonderful - it's nice to go somewhere without the servers telling you their name and prattling on - we weren't interupted when having a personal conversation - they were attentive but invisible - I also liked that the food wasn't rushed - the first course comes and there's a nice pause before the main course - the amuse bouche before the meal was lovely. also - I typically don't do the 'chef recommended wine pairings' at restaurants but I did that evening - they were wonderful and fantastic with each dish. the foie gras is great. my only complaint is that my pasta, while perfectly al dente, was a bit oily and the creme brulee didn't have the firm crispy crust one hopes for. otherwise a wonderul meal.
Dined on November 6, 2009|there are other restaurants|4|there are other restaurants that serve similar food at lower prices but gracie's has special tastes of things between courses and afterwards that make it special-and you can't beat the atmosphere-service was a little too overzealous
November 5, 2009|The food, both in its quality|4|The food, both in its quality and in its preparation, is sublime. The sauces and condiments are exceptional. The various course options are a wonderful alternative to al a carte dining. My only critiicsm would be the wait at the entrance to be seated (no one was present and we waited about 5-6 minutes) but when hostess appeared she was most apologetic. Also, it was a while before a waiter (then 2 waiters) approached the table. However,service afterwards was impeccable.
November 4, 2009|We have always enjoyed our|5|We have always enjoyed our dining experience at Gracies and return whenever we are attending Trinity Theater. The wait staff is attentive and we have had many conversations with the restaurant manager, most recently concerning holding other events at the restaurant for my business for client appreciation and retention. THe food is fabulous, the people are friendly, and the overall experience is one I would recommend highly.
November 3, 2009|Every bite that each of us|5|Every bite that each of us took was a treat - we did the prix fixe choice - 3 courses for $30.00 and it was more than worth every bite. We were passing samples to our tablemates of each of our choices as we wanted everyone to taste it all. Great staff, great music, great decor. Kudos.
October 30, 2009|All in all Gracies is a great|4|All in all Gracies is a great place to take a date. The food is great and the atmosphere is perfect for a date
October 27, 2009|Flavor, flavor, flavor! Wonderful|4|Flavor, flavor, flavor! Wonderful menu. The prix fix menu is a fabulous bargain. The cocktail, beer and wine list is very well thought out, the service very good, and a fine time was had by all. I took a group of 6 there and absorbed a lot of ribbing (JB, I don't think that they have anything on this menu in Oklahama), but at the end of the night they all told me how much they enjoyed the food. Foodies will only be disappointed that they can't order everything on the menu. Tip: bring someone who will order a meal that you would want and share.
October 24, 2009|Despite a 45 minute wait for|4|Despite a 45 minute wait for our drinks and five different servers repeating questions and offers, our dinner was fantastic. THe menu was interesting and all three courses in our prix fixe menu were outstanding.
October 24, 2009|We were going to the theater|2|We were going to the theater after dining and made this known to the server. The main course came too late and we had to rush thru this part of the meal. This was unfortunate but I feel we should have been informed of the kitchen running behind causing a delay in getting our meal.. We would have come back for the meal after the theater if we were informed of the problem.
October 17, 2009|Had a great post-Lupo's concert|4|Had a great post-Lupo's concert dinner at Gracie's. The prix fixe menu provided plenty of options for my wife and me, and the service was excellent.
October 17, 2009|Excellent dining experience.|5|Excellent dining experience. We tried the chef's 5 course tasting menu - well worth the cost. The restaurant was cozy, service was wonderful (very attentive but did not rush us at all), and food was to die for. Only thing that would have made it better was maybe a quick visit from the chef. Most people around us were celebrating special occasions - we were just celebrating a night without kids! Our second meal at Gracie's, and we will back!
October 16, 2009|Had a lovely night out at|4|Had a lovely night out at Gracies with our multi-generational table! We enjoyed the very reasonable prix-fixe dinner, with surcharges for just a few items (foie gras, saddle of lamb). Sat in the front bar area at banquette tables, very warm and inviting, and preferred, given the early time we dined and relative emptiness of main dr until later. Service was very cordial and helpful, and seafood (skate,scallops) and lamb entrees were delicious. Rigatoni was less successful, a bit too spicy. ALl desserts were great! Good wine list.
October 10, 2009|An exceptionally ambitious|4|An exceptionally ambitious menu with high quality, often local, ingredients, in one of the most romantic and 'grown up' restaurants around. The tasting menu is a rare experience (altho note it can only be served if all at the table order it, so plan guests accordingly), and the prix fixe --3 courses - a veritable bargain. A wonderful, convivial place on the edge of Providence's art district.
October 10, 2009|Prix fixe menu available on|4|Prix fixe menu available on a Saturday night. Little amuse-bouche arrive throughout the meal. Attentive but not intrusive service. And really good food. What's not to like?
October 9, 2009|We decided to check out Gracie's|5|We decided to check out Gracie's before we went to a play at Trinity Rep, which is right across the street and were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was pleasant,the service was great and the food was excellent. We did the 3 course prefix because we were concerned that the quantity of food as we were headed off to the show. I started with the cucumber gazpacho with shrimp which was pretty much perfect to my taste. Just the right amount of garlic which is somehow difficult for some chefs to figure out. My wife had the field green salad which she claimed to also be perfect. From there...we knew we were in for a treat...and we were not were not disappointed. Note the 40 for 40 wine list and don't hesitate on desert which is worth the trip.
October 3, 2009|We absolutely fell in love|5|We absolutely fell in love with Gracie's, the food was fantastic and the little treats they kept bringing us were great! Thank you for a wonderful anniversary meal!!!
October 3, 2009|It was a very nice suprise,|4|It was a very nice suprise, my mother gave us a gift certificate that she won in a raffle and we were looking for a new restuarant to try close to the PPAC. The 3 for 30 was a great way to eat economically and try some delicious food very well prepared. The portions are also just right with great little touches. The wait staff was pofessional and attentive, when I waited more then 5 minutes for my drink they gave it to me for free which I did not expect.
October 3, 2009|Another great night at Gracie's.|5|Another great night at Gracie's. Joe was our waiter and he did a great job! He didn't rush us and my wine glass never went empty. Thats a good thing. :-) John
October 2, 2009|we were in Providence to see|5|we were in Providence to see a play, not to have one of the best meals we've ever had anywhere, but that's what we got a Gracie's: who knew such a find existed in a pretty lousy part of a pretty forgettable city?! spectacular food and service at a reasonable (but not cheap) price. if you like progressive American cuisine, try Gracie's. we'll be back.
October 1, 2009|In celebrating my wife’s 50th|5|In celebrating my wife’s 50th birthday I was looking for a very special experience and Gracie’s came through with flying colors. We had a table for two in the wine room which is a very eloquent, well appointed room that creates a wonderful environment for gourmet dining. We choose the seven course tasting menu with paired wines and were rewarded with elaborate presentations of small, often quite rich courses complimented perfectly by a wide array of wines. The service was impeccable and clearly vested in creating an experience to be remembered. Within minutes of leaving the restaurant we were playing out the scenarios as to our next special event that could be celebrated at Gracie’s. Happy Birthday Heidi!
September 26, 2009|We had a wonderful experience.|5|We had a wonderful experience. The attention to the tiniest detail (lining up the glasses and silverware) was much appreciated. When you see those little things in the front of the house, you know the same care is being taken in preparing the food behind the scenes. Everything was delicious.
September 24, 2009|In every respect we enjoyed|5|In every respect we enjoyed Gracies. The service, food and atmosphere were at very high standards and the pre fixe menu is a fabulous bargain. We intend to come back again and can easily recommend Gracies to our friends.
September 24, 2009|Wonderful restaurant with|5|Wonderful restaurant with great atmosphere, lighting, music and most of all food! The front of the house was friendly and inviting, and our waitstaff was excellent and very attentive, but not overly so. The menu was great with tasting menus paired with wines and also interesting selections of pasta, duck, salads, etc. Enjoyed it thoroughly! They even have a small wine room downstairs that would be a great for four couples, plus a larger room that holds about 50! Something for everyone!
September 19, 2009|It was a special occasion|4|It was a special occasion and family members loved it.
September 19, 2009|We had a great time, the food|4|We had a great time, the food was excellent. We did the 5 course chef choice dinner. And as a picky eater, I was impressed. I liked everything. The portions were on the small side, but overall it was a great place.
September 18, 2009|The best meal we have had|5|The best meal we have had in Providence this summer, and some of the best service we have ever had--well-informed, professional, and still friendly. But the tables for two are too close together, unless you want to meet, or overlap conversations with, the people next to you.
September 15, 2009|Our first experience at Gracie's|3|Our first experience at Gracie's - food was great - but tiny. Did the chef's tasting menu 5 course with wines...all food was GREAT! Locally sourced foods which ups the ante and makes it phenenomal, but I did leave feeling I could have eaten a little more! But maybe that's just me!! We sat in the wine room downstairs, which was great...was very private and perfect for us! Wines that were paired with dinner were great...would have maybe appreciated a more generous pore...but all in all was good - I say good because the food was great and pairings were awesome, but the price and portion size could have been a bit better...I won't run back, but glad I went.
September 12, 2009|The food was unbelievably|4|The food was unbelievably great, had an amuse bouche that was thinly sliced watermelon filled with ricotta cheese that looked like a ravioli. Appetizers of heirloom tomato salad with more delicious ricotta cheese, cucumber gazpacho soup w/poached shrimp and corn chowder. A palate cleanser w/some frosty lemonade and onto entrees of halibut and salmon; the halibut was the best any of us have ever had. Desserts were chooclate pot de creme and peach financiers - all a fitting end to dinner. When they brought the check, they also brought a tray of delicate petit fours with black raspberry gels, chocolate macaroons and butter cookies. The management was gracious and servers were lovely. Our waiter was fine but seemed a little on edge.
September 8, 2009|Our first visit and it was|5|"Our first visit and it was a special occasion - our 35th wedding anniversary. We were greeted with Happy Anniversary. Our table was in a quiet corner, with a candle and ""stars"" on the table - nice touch. Complimentary champagne toast upon arrival, amuse bouche and sweets post-meal were a wonderful bonus. Dinner was fabulous as was the service. Other diners drifted in, nearly filling the dining room on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. We shall be back."
September 5, 2009|We enjoyed the $30 prix fixe|4|We enjoyed the $30 prix fixe menu on a Saturday prior to visiting Waterfire. The food was very good to excellent and each course was quite enjoyable. The service was efficient and knowledgeable. The amuse bouche and petit fours were unexpected and greatly appreciated. I would recommend Gracie's to anyone who wants to enjoy a great meal in Providence.
September 5, 2009|We (2) ordered the five course|4|We (2) ordered the five course degustation. Lovely, creative combinations of flavors, aromas,and textures; courses were sequenced thoughtfully. Portions were perfectly sized for a 5 course meal. Service was attentive without being overbearing. Wine list was limited but generally populated by food-friendly wines; a few gems can be found. We will certainly go again the next time we are in Providence.
September 5, 2009|Food was good. Service can|3|Food was good. Service can improve. Desert took too long and was never notified of why till I asked a waiter.
September 4, 2009|This was not as good an experience|3|This was not as good an experience as i've had multiple times before. our 5 course tasting menu (+ added foie gras) was quite nice, (the duck was really good), but the service was very leisurely, to put it kindly, inattentive more accurately (multiple times i had to pour wine for the table), and one corner of my foie gras was actually cold. Maybe the slow service (took more than three hours to eat) was due to the holiday weekend, but the restaurant wasn't even full. I'll keep coming, hoping this was an unusual night.
September 4, 2009|My husband and I went for|5|My husband and I went for our 30th Anniversary dinner. I mentioned it in my reservation and they made sure we had a nice private table. They also gave us complimentary champagne toast. The service was excellent. We had the 7 course wine paring meal that was a true dinning experience and one we will remember for a long time.

August 29, 2009|We found this restaurant to|4|We found this restaurant to be very expensive. Even though we had a $200 gift card we still added $125 towards the dinner. We did the 7 course tasting and were very surprised that our coffee was an additional cost on the meal. We enjoyed our evening but would not do it again. The waiters and waitresses were all excellent but we have been to Morton's Steakhouse, Charly's steakhouse and numerous upscale restaurants in Boston, New York, Florida and have had outstanding service as well.
August 29, 2009|What can I say but the food|5|"What can I say but the food and service is five star worthy....you won't be disappointed. This is my new favorite restaurant. The chef is so creative and each dish is not anly a work of art from a visual perspective, but also from a tasting perspective as well. gordon Ramsey should feasture this restaurant on one of his shows as an example of ""what to do right!"" It would be hard to find anywhere to top this place."

August 27, 2009|Great ambiance and charming|4|Great ambiance and charming decor. The food has a nice presentation and is delicious! The Prix Fixe menu has something for everyone -- vegetarian, low calorie, fish, pasta, beef. The bass was freshly caught and the pasta with mushroom dish was homemade. Scrumptious, homemade desserts -- the creme brulee was outstanding as was the fruit crisp. The waiter was attentive, but discreet and great service. Definitely worth returning.
August 27, 2009|Wonderful place to enjoy a|5|Wonderful place to enjoy a night with your loved one - the tasting menu made it simple to enjoy each others company without being over the top when it comes to flavors. We went to the restaurant based on the previous reviews and they are absolutely spot on! We decided to have the five course tasting with wine pairing. The quality of food was amazing and portion size was just right - something many people harp on but we weren't stuffed and in a food coma but rather comfortable. Most of the ingredients in the meals were locally grown or harvested, to include many of the wine pairings. Go there now and go there often to enjoy a fabulous meal with service I haven't seen in a long time!

August 15, 2009|We ordered the 5 course tasting|3|We ordered the 5 course tasting menu with wine. While the food was good, although small, the amount of time between courses was ridiculous. The long intervals almost ruined the meal. The wait staff brought the basket of bread around several times which was good since the courses were so spread out. The final course of lamb was a bit undercooked but still tasty. I would recommend this restaurant if you have 3 hourse to kill for a meal.
August 15, 2009|May very well be the best|5|May very well be the best food in RI, a triumph in fine dining. Outstanding treatment due to many variables, knowledgeable, professional teamwork and a general manager who had an eye on eveything. Stunning and wonderful, one of life's true pleasures.
August 13, 2009|The menu is one of the most|5|The menu is one of the most creative I have seen, and features locally grown produce extensively. Everything was very fresh and quite flavorful. Portions were appropriate -- we left satisfied after having two courses each and then splitting a dessert. Wine list is extensive, and carries many items I have not seen elsewhere. Wine prices are a bit on the high side, but we found a moderately priced selection that turned out to be fabulous. Server was young, but intelligent and well trained. Overall, a wonderful experience. Not equivalent to the very best places in larger NE cities, but definitely the best place we've found in Providence.

Ok but not stellar wine choices. Great, friendly and competent service. This is a place I would definitely bring my daughter who works for Bon Appetit magazine and who, like us, is able to eat all over the world. Kudos Gracie's for a fantastic dining experience.

Service was VERY slow, with no explanation. We overheard later that they were short a person in the kitchen. That did not explain why it took 15 minutes for cocktails to arrive. The food was good, but not as good as they first time we were there. The chef did send out desert which was very nice. However, it was a birthday celebration and the entire evening was disappointing. We will go back, but not for a long time.

We have been there about 5 times in the last 6 months and every time we have gone we have had an amazing meal. Yum! They have outstanding homemade breads and then they give you little ""freebies"" in between the first and second course which are delicious. Each course is SO good and I can't wait to go back. We highly recommend this restautant. You will not be disappointed."

Our dining experience at Gracie's was the highlite of the trip. We chose the five course sampler menu with the wine pairing. On top of each dish being out of the world the wines nicely complimented the meal. We would definately dine here again and recomend it to anybody planning to visit the area.

July 15, 2009|Unlike a reservation I had|4|Unlike a reservation I had had two weeks ago through Open table at the Regatta in cape cod, this restaurant really paid attention to my request--in fact the manager called me before we went to see what he could do and make sure he understood the event we were celebrating. I made the reservation for 7:30 but we were not seated until closer to 8pm(we actually got there early)It was restaurant week and was very busy. The table had little stars over it which was a lovely touch for acknowledment of our anniversary--the people next to us were to and had stars to so it made it really special. We ordered at 8:20 and then did not get our food until around 8:45...we ordered the tasting menu which obviously took more time to prepare, but there was
July 14, 2009|The fixed price menu was diverse|3|The fixed price menu was diverse enough. We picked the Cucumber Gazpacho Shrimp soup and the local greens salad. Both were too small. The salad was ordinary and the soup was, well green and barely in the bowl. The 2 shrimp didn't count for much. We realize this is a fixed price menue but unless the regular menu offered larger portions, this would be a problem given the regular prices. We both picked the Duck: I thought it was very nice, and a good portion. The accompanyments were good. My wife didn't like the accompanyments. The chocolate tart was VG, the Creme Brule with fruit was misnamed. 2 berries only shouldn't be mentioned. On the whole the meal was Good but a full price diner might not be worth the price.
July 12, 2009|Went during Resturant Week.|4|Went during Resturant Week. Food was great and service, but regular prices high for a such a casual looking place. Fish dinner was $29 on regular menu.

The flavours and seasoning were well balanced - a strong focus on veg, sometimes even overpowering the protein on the dish.

The food was delectable; every morsel was fresh, well-seasoned and melted in my mouth. Additionally, I was blown away by the wait staff's attention to detail; they catered to my every whim without stifling my dining experience. If I had the means, I would make myself a ""regular"" at this establishment. Bravo."

I had the 5 course tasting menu, and while the food was delicious, one of the problems was how long it took. The second course came out 30 minutes after the first course, and no one bothered to tell us why it took so long until the food got there. Apparently, the chef wasn't happy with the way the original gnocchi was cooked, making an entire new batch. Understandable, but I wish I knew that earlier. The servers tried to be efficient but there were several mix ups and I had no idea who my waiter was. Perhaps they just had a rough night. While the service lacked, the food was great so I'd definitely try it out.
July 2, 2009|I've been to Gracie's a couple|3|I've been to Gracie's a couple of times and prior to this night, the service has been impeccable and the food absolutely wonderful. This night, the food was great but the service was very disappointing. I had reservations for 7:30 but called in earlier in the day to change it to 7. When we got there around 6:45, we still had to sit at the bar and the place was practically empty. We must have been at the bar for over half an hour before we decided to get up and remind the host that were still waiting. After being seated at our table and given the menus, we sat for another 25 minutes before having to flag someone. Long story short, horrible service but still great food. Because past experiences there were wonderful, I'd still go again.
June 30, 2009|The food was wonderful, the|4|The food was wonderful, the reception warm, and service was friendly. It was a weekday, and they had just gotten a big group downstairs. Apparently, the kitchen and wait staff was overwhelmed, so it took over a half hour for our salads and another long wait for our entrees. The chef was apologetic, and sent us several small bites to tide us over. We were not in a hurry, but we were in the restaurant for almost two hours. I assume our experience was unusual for this restaurant, and we will try it again, since everything else was excellent.

The details - down to the chef's first taste that comes out before the meal and strawberry palate cleanser - are really charming. It was our second time heading down to Gracie's from Boston for a special occasion, and we'll certainly be back.

June 13, 2009|Wonderful tasting menu with|4|Wonderful tasting menu with excellent wine pairings. The gnocchi with peas and pancetta was simply the best gnocchi I have ever tasted. The foie gras course was inventive, pairing the typical pan seared foie with a lemon shortcake. Portions were perfect; after seven courses I was comfortably full, not stuffed. Service was excellent- attentive without hovering. Dessert was slightly disappointing given the phenomenal food that proceeded it but overall very good. A little noisy and the visible (though thankfully not audible) TV in the bar area definitely decreased the ambiance factor. The food is black tie but the atmosphere of the restaurant is decidedly more casual (not a dinner jacket or tie to be seen on the clientele).

With the $30 prix fixe (clocking in at less for the whole meal than for some of the entrees alone) I was blown away. No skimping on quality or ingredients - just consisted of slightly smaller portions, which were still more than enough. Complimentary valet parking was the icing on the cake. This is not a meal to be missed!

The wait staff was very attentive to out needs but not intrusive. Reccomendations were made by the staff about wine and dinner options. Following their advice, it was an incredible meal. Service and food was comprable to five star restaurants in other cities. Can't wait to come back!!

We never felt rushed, we had cocktails,and ordered dinner, I had the Norwegian Salmon and My wife had the Nantucket Scallops, both were well prepared and presented nicely. We had time for desert and an espresso before our play at Trinity Rep. Gracie's Brule was especially good. Overall we had an excellent meal and definitely will be back next year.

We both shared the chocolate pot de fue for dessert and it was all fabulous. The service started out spectacular! Just enough without it feeling like they were hovering... but toward the end of the meal we never saw our waiter again. We had to have the hostess run our check for us after waiting almost 15 minutes because we were going to be late for our show. Of course if we didn't have a show to go to we probably wouldn't have minded lingering longer. That was the only drawback of the night!
May 27, 2009|Serveice was outstanding (including|5|Serveice was outstanding (including complimentary valet parking). We went with our waiter's menu suggestions and were not dissapointed. The complimentary chefs' offerings (between courses) were outstanding. Overall, one of our finest dining experiences (We've been married 30 years!).

Everything was incredibly fresh, and had some very unique flavors. The service could not have been better.

The servers are fantastic, the ambiance ideal, and the presentation perfect. Though the food is not THE BEST EVER, it is very satisfying. We had a lovely time, and I would certainly recommend it to others.
May 20, 2009|Our dinner at Gracie's was|5|Our dinner at Gracie's was our first visit, and we will be going back, for certain. Very nice special occasion ambience and decor. Tables nicely spaced. However, we went on a Wednesday night, and very few other diners, so hard to get good judge on what noise level might be on busier weekend. We chose the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings and it was great fun. Courses were well paced, and small enough that we could finish and continue easily between course, but never felt we were waiting, and never got full. Excellent range of wine pairings, all with good but not too big a pour, so we kept our senses. Food all outstanding but we especially enjoyed soft shell crab and the foie gras. Service was outstanding. Price was high, but fair.
May 16, 2009|Very friendly, attentive,|5|"Very friendly, attentive, efficient waitstaff. Fabulous food with great little ""goodies"" for free(kiwi-strawberry soup, frozen lemonade, sweets). I like to try different restaurants each time I go out, but this is one to which I will return (many times)!"

This trip was a pre-theater dinner, as Trinity rep is right across the street. There were 4 of us, and we all opted for the 3 course $30 pre-fixe menu. An excellent choice, and you should definitely try it!
May 7, 2009|We always make a reservation|4|We always make a reservation at Gracie's when we are coming into Providence for a show at The Trinity Rep. The fact that they now offer a prix fix 'theater tasting menu' as well as offering a discount to theater subscribers insures that we will return each and every time. Dinner at Gracie's before the pay makes for a very special evening out.

In any event though we always enjoy the food and the staff is always attentive.

We particularly enjoy the tasting menu which is always nicely balanced. The wine list is adequate and the ambience is very pleasant for a special evening. The roominess and lack of noise is a blessing, given that most restaurants are too noisy for decent conversation. Highly recommended.
April 14, 2009|Gracie's is always wonderful.|4|"Gracie's is always wonderful. The food is gorgeously presented, as well as being perfectly prepared. And the little ""tasties"" between the courses are unique and delicious. In addition, the menu is always a little adventurous, but never fails to delight us. The hearts of palm salad was not what I expected, but turned out to be better than I could have imagined, and Gracie's is the only local restaurant that I know that serves sweetbreads, one of my favorite delicacies. I highly recommend it, and can't wait to go back."

The hearts of palm salad combined a wonderful variety of tastes, the bass was light and delicious, asparagus cooked perfectly -- slightly crunchy. My friend loved the variety and texture of the vegetarian selection. The waitress was very friendly and attentive but never hovering or getting in the way of conversation. We went before going to Trinity Repertory Theatre, right across the street, so it was extremely convenient as well.

March 6, 2009|The experience was amazing.|5|"The experience was amazing. We took our Aunt & Uncle pre-theater. Though the menu was foreign to them (both 80) they thoroughly enjoyed being pampered by an incredible staff. The Onion Soup was a similar, yet different concept and presentation, to one I once had at ""21"" in Manahattan. My partner had the fras groie and was non-plussed. The entrees were not simply works of art, but the quality and taste were top notch. They all had sea scallops and I had the special Rib Eye... among the best steaks I've ever had, cooked perfectly. A surprise amuse bouche and sherbet course made it all feel that much more special. We continued to rave long after we left the theater. One of the priciest meals we ever had, but more than worth it."

Tuesday night was slow, so we were catered to much more efficiently as a result. I had the salmon, only because my guest had the sea scallops. The salmon was prepared well but I've had better. The sea scallops with mascarpone ravioli for only a dollar more was much better. I'm eager to return and try a different dish. The downstairs, which was closed at the time, seemed to be more elegant than the main floor (upstairs) dining area. Definitely a good place to try.

The food was inventive and tasty (and the chef was gracious and flexible about some food preferences). The service was extremely attentive and there were so many nice, discrete touches (complimentary champagne to start the birthday dinner, a scattering of glittery stars on the table cloth, and a lovely dessert course). Gracie's is a bit of splurge, but it was a memorable meal and we felt we had been treated royally. Highly recommend it for a special occasion.

We are such chocoholics that the only thing I could find to complain about was there was no chocolate at desert but the two different ones we got where outstanding, so how could you complain. The wait staff was attentive and enjoyable. Do not do the tasting if you don’t have the time. It took almost three hours at a comfortable tempo. However, they were able to turn over tables next to us that where ordering ala cart quick enough to get everyone off to their show. A very nice evening that I can recomend for a special occasion.

The waitress was delightful despite being under a lot of stress from a number of demanding tables. The food was delicious, well served and everything was as we ordered it.

I had the filet, which was fine, but I have had just as good at an Outback. The wine list is very long and varied, but the server didn't know anything about any of the wines. The dessert was great! Go for the creme brulee and a cocktail and you'll be happy! The server was short with us and rude and perhaps she was having a bad night, but for as much as we paid I expected more.

Typically the pairings and food are outstanding but I have always ordered these items on a slower evening. The staff seemed to struggle on the busier night and left me a tad disappointed. Food and service are typically great but wilted under the pressure of a busy evening.
February 14, 2009|Food was spectacular! Sitting|2|"Food was spectacular! Sitting in front of large windows in bar was extremely cold and uncomfortable. Although the food was served hot it cooled reapidly.Waiter ""Joe"" was distracted,unable to keep tract of the number of courses in the tasting menu, was late with the accompanying wine and in the middle of describing the wine would turn to talk to another table. He was arrogant and aloof.Not the usual quality of Gracies' staff. We have dined here for the past 5 years. This was the first disappointing experience.We will reuest ""John"" withour next experience."
February 14, 2009|We had reservations for Valentine's|5|We had reservations for Valentine's Day and we had never been to Gracie's before so we were curious, to say the least, about the experience. No worries, about anything. The waitstaff were wonderful. Chrissy, our waitress, was friendly and pleasant; there was a young server, who as it turns out also makes their beer bread, and we enjoyed listening to him detail the meal. We chose the 7 course chef's choice menu; I had the wine pairing and my boyfriend did not. The food was excellent and inventive and served with the eye in mind, but without an overwhelming flash, which was perfect. The food was delicious! We did not know what the courses would be but we were pleasantly surprised with each course.
February 14, 2009|A few bad choices by an establishme|3|A few bad choices by an establishment can take away from what would otherwise be a really great experience. The food at Gracie's is fantastic. The wine list is good, and the decor is charming. I wanted to have a great time at Gracie's but a couple things got in the way. First, instead of spacing our the reservations the restaurant chose to seat in shifts, meaning us and about 15 tables sat at the same time. This resulted in us sitting at our table with no water, no waiter, no acknowledgement of existance for over 30 minutes. We didnt even get our dinner order in until after 1 hour. Second, it was freezing in the restaurant. I sat with my coat on for the whole night, and looking around the room saw several other tables doing the same.
February 13, 2009|The food was very good, but|4|The food was very good, but we expected something more outstandng for the price. Service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice.

My wife loves the food while I agree the food is exceptional I love the wait people (Wait-trons my wife calls them- She is a retired Garde Mander) work as a team in making sure that Gracie’s guests are taken care of. If I would have just one mini enhancement is we had to get someone’s attention to get more coffee. An empty wine class was filled quickly however this was not the case with an empty coffee cup. Great Restaurant! John McEwing Tiverton, RI.

I've had the gnocchi there a number of times and each time it's been fabulous. The filet of beef was so tender you could cut it with a fork. Having it topped with an onion jelly made it different and mouth watering. Dining at Gracie's is a delightful experience. I will definitly go back again and again and again.
January 8, 2009|We have been here several|4|We have been here several times, usually followed by an evening at Trinity Rep, just across the street. It is dependably good and also convenient. The service was slow, though we were served and finished in plenty of time for our 7:30 curtain. It is hard to understand why we were required to make a 5:15 reservation.
January 3, 2009|Outstanding mushroom gnocchi|5|Outstanding mushroom gnocchi appetizer - don't miss it. My beet salad was fine, but not particularly special (some of the beets were undercooked). Both of us ordered the grass-fed rib eyes, which were perfect. Our flourless chocolate cake was delicious, though not particularly unique. Fun amuse bouche before the meal, and a small bite of sorbet between courses. Service was okay, but the bar/wine manager (I believe his name was Ankur) was fantastic, knowledgeable, and personable. He offered us a fantastic wine recommendation, and was eager to chat about Gracie's food, chef, and history. He made our night.

Everything on the 7-course tasting was very good, though some courses I'd rate outstanding and others good. Gracie's is among the very best restaurants in the area and also among the priciest.
December 13, 2008|We were greeted with bithday|5|We were greeted with bithday wishes. The waiter noticed that I was pregnant and when I ordered the cheese tray, he let me know that there were some non-pasturized cheeses on the plate. The chef made me a special cheese tray just for me which was delicious. The food was excellent. Each course was better than the one before. The staff made my husband and I feel very special during our night out to celebrate. It was a wonderful evening and we found a new favorite restaurant in Providence. We will be returning soon.
December 9, 2008|I have to say that the Gracie's|4|I have to say that the Gracie's strongest point has always been service and attention to details. The service this time was very good but not outstanding as in the past. There are plenty of restaurants with good food in Providence but what made the place special was the service. This was not the case this time.

December 6, 2008|Absolutely wonderful dining|5|"Absolutely wonderful dining experience. Food is creative without being over-the-top and ingrediants are well chosen to balance each dish. Our server was good, although not as good as some at other tables (where we couldn't help hearing interesting comments about the dishes and preparations that were not shared with us) Tables for 2 were a little close, but the seating and reservations seemed to be staggered somewhat to minimize the feeling that you were dining as a party of 4 rather than a party of 2. Too bad the general public has become so casual - this is a great ""special occasion"" restaurant where the next table might be wearing jeans and sneakers. All in all, still my FAVORITE restaurant in Providence - consistently fab!"
December 4, 2008|Food was excellent but service|4|Food was excellent but service was not so great. I asked for extra sauce for my meal and never received it. Waiter rarely showed up to ask if we needed anything. I had to ask for a dessert menu and when asked about the time of our desserts because we had a show to go to, he said he would bring them when the came up.

I must say,however, that the gnocchi was by far the best we have ever had! all the wines paired well with the selections,but a touch more with each serving would have been better.our server was attentive and very knowledgable.after dinner we sat at the bar for a drink and fun conversation with the bartender and our server.(it was a very quiet night) would highly recommend gracies!

We sat in a very private booth towards the front, with 2 laarge hurricane lamps guarding the enclave. We were given a small glass of champagne to celebrate the occasion, and another small morsel from the chef. There are lots of menus to choose from, the theater menu with apps, main course & dessert, also chefs special 5/7 course tasting. We decided to just each order apps & a regular dish from the menu. We were given raspberry sorbet to cleanse our palets after the apps. The main course was wonderful, fresh & abundant. As a special surprise, a dessert was brought out with a sparkling candle in it! We will go back, but save up!!!

With six people or more, ask for the ""wine room"" in the cellar, cozy, quiet, special. The only downside to this place is the noise level in the main dining room, itself visually very pleasant."

Fantastic service and attention to detail. Very warm and welcoming experience.

The food and its preparation live up to or exceed the promise of the menu. Service was awesome, the manager stopped by several times to make sure we were well cared for, and he brought two dishes that we hadn't ordered, as gifts from the chef. This is a very expensive restaurant, with a limited but well represented wine list. However, I will definitely return, as the dining experience was truly exceptional."

We sat in a nice corner round which was comfortable and romantic, but unfortunately it looked into a workstation that had a bright light shining into it. It was also right near the bathroom. The waiter was pleasant and fairly knowledgable, but the service was sporadic with a significant amount of time between the first course and the second course. I made a note it was our anniversary on my Opentable reservation, and they wished us happy anniversary upon our arrival, and gave us a complementary spanish sparkler to start the meal. Very nice touch!

The waitstaff had subtly decorated our requested quiet table and offered free glasses of champagne. Everyone quietly wished us a Happy Anniversary. The service was top notch and unobtrusive. Specific dietary requests were met with ease. The food was served with wonderful presentation and in a timely manner and everything was extremely well prepared. Our evening was wonderful and the food fantastic. The complementary valet parking was an added bonus. We highly recommend this restaurant.

The food from the first course to desserts were excellent. Clean, fresh, vibrant flavors and solid cooking techniques. The service was friendly, helpful yet unobtrusive. This is now our fav restaurant!"
September 13, 2008|First time at Gracie's...|4|First time at Gracie's... Overall I found the experience very good. The menu, although not the largest in town seemed to still have variety. We had the garden salad and the potato gnocchi as our first courses. The salad was good although the dressing was a little sparse. The gnocchi was surprisingly light and paired well with a sweet sauce, peas and carrots (which were cut just like the peas). We were brought out a watermelon palate cleanser before our first course and raspberry gelato afterwards. The watermelon was paired with a honey glaze which together was light and airy. The gelato was fantastic. We also experienced the duck entree which I have to say was terrific (although i must admit it was my first time having duck).
September 13, 2008|"Gracie's has been on my ""to"|5|"Gracie's has been on my ""to visit"" list for quite a well, waiting for an appropriate special occasion. The service was a little chaotic (they seem to use a team service concept, so over the evening we had about six people serving our table), but despite that the service was good. Food was quite excellent. I opened with the James Beard pan-seared gnocchi, which were everything I expect from good gnocchi: good texture, a good sear, and nice balance of flavor, nicely complemented by the shaved truffle. My 2nd course, the three preparations of pork, was nicely presented, and all three pork items were nicely prepared and very flavorful. All-in-all, an excellent meal."
September 6, 2008|The tasting menu was fabulous.|4|The tasting menu was fabulous. We had a hard time picking just one appetizer and entree so the tasting menu gave an ample sample of several items. Food is fresh and very well presented.
September 3, 2008|Absolutely wonderful restaurant.|5|Absolutely wonderful restaurant. We were treated like royalty. Our choice was the 7 course tasting menu with wine, and every bite was superb! A party in your mouth! The wines were well chosen to go with each course, and the fois gras was to die for! Highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion (or if you have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it.....well worth the price!)
August 30, 2008|Tried the 7-course tasting|2|Tried the 7-course tasting menu. The first two courses were pretty good and agreeable. Unfortunately disappointment started right after the third course, food was either too salty or too bland. Pacing was irratic despite it was late and restaurant was not too busy. The menu composition was also problematic, imagine one is served with rabbit roll for meat course in a high end restaurant such as Gracie's. Our server was polite, but he was simply not keeping track of what was going on with our table. Even though some dishes were fine, but the overall restaurant experience did not live up to our expectation, given the price of the tasting menu.

This time we wanted to share our experience with friends who do not venture into ""different"" areas. They were very pleased by the cordial reception and the interior decor. Our waiter,John, was very helpful with wine choices and descriptions of the menu items. We arrived earlier than our reservation and were seated immediately. Making the online reservations let me make some requests to ensure that our guests would be comfortable. The meal was served in a timely fashion and with attention to details.All of the staff were cheerful and gracious. I'm certain that Gracie's made a hit with our guests. We will be back!"
August 9, 2008|Based on a gushing referral|5|Based on a gushing referral from a friend, I took my wife to Gracie's for her birthday dinner. We had high expectations and were not disappointed. The service was excellent - informative and personable without being intrusive. We opted for the 5-course tasting menu with wine pairings. The pairings were phenomenal - enhancing, but not overshadowing each course, which, in themselves were gourmet caliber. Also, a champagne toast for the birthday girl (and husband) to start the affair was very nice. I think we have a new favorite Providence restaurant!
August 8, 2008|Good for a special occasion|3|Good for a special occasion or before/after Trinity Theater, but quite pricey, especially the wine list.
August 8, 2008|We had the 7 course tasting|5|We had the 7 course tasting menu which was fabulous! Personal preferences were taken into account and the menu based upon whatever was the best in the market that day. The food was beautiful as well as delicious. The servers were knowledgeable about the food and wine which they were serving. Note, the pace of the tastings was leisurely - all the better to savor each course and to reflect upon the food and wine pairings. Do not expect a quick night out - you will be frustrated. However, if you are looking for a night where you are NOT rushed out of the restaurant, and the food comes along as it's prepared - you'll love it!

I will definitely visit again.

July 19, 2008|For a restaurant that charges|2|For a restaurant that charges 30+ for entrees the wait staff should be on the ball. The waiter came over and read us what seemed like a riot act for what we can and can't order. The restaurant menu was changed but they offered another fish option with an added $10.00 just for halibut which I thought was ridiculous. We were told twice that what we had ordered was not available but they sorted it out and came up with something else. It took 20 minutes for our drinks and bread. When the waiter came to serve bread our friend accidentally reached for a piece in the open basket and the waiter rudely whisked the basket away as if she had been to the bathroom and not washed her hands. It was very embarrassing and uncomfortable. It was just okay.

Definitely a great place to bring people so they feel satisfied and content with a night out. Service was slower during this visit than last time. We had to ask someone to locate our waiter so we could order more wine. Also, the second bottle of wine we ordered was not the correct variety of grape--same vineyard and year, but it not the one we asked for and no one mentioned this when the bottle was presented. Unfortunately, I did not notice until after we'd been served. Nonetheless, the wine was fine and comparable, but definitely not what I would expect from Gracie's.
July 18, 2008|We have eaten at this restaurant|3|We have eaten at this restaurant twice in the last 30 days. Overall the food is quite good. The service is a bit lacking, however. Everyone is pleasant and means well, but the food was served at an uneven pace. Silverware was forgotten. Bread was forgotten. The first time we dined it took 40 minutes to have our cocktails served. The restaurant was kind enough to not charge us for the cocktails, however, given the circumstances. Still, we enjoyed both meals and plan to return.

July 13, 2008|I normally don't do these|5|I normally don't do these but Gracie's is worth talking about. It was an excellent experience -- food was great and the service was excellent, and this was during Restaurant Week -- they did a fabulous job when many restaurants do not. We also brought a preschooler and she was treated very well -- our server even thought to include her in the amuse bouche and intermezzo course, which she loved, because it was a sorbet. Little extras like that really make for a nice experience. I would highly recommend Gracie's both for the delicious food and great service -- hard to come by both!

While I had heard great things, I mainly went to check out my friends' place of work. I was, however, taken aback at how truly great Gracie's was. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and every aspect of it looks up to par from the front door to the kitchen. While a table was not ready at our reservation time, we enjoyed drinks at the bar and were seated in a timely manner. The waitstaff was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive, and our water glases were never left empty nor were dirty plate left on the table after we had finished. Overall, my dinig experience at Gracie's was certainly one of the finer.

I am a restaurant manager in Providence and would love to have the team that Chef Joe has working for him. Everything was absolutely spot on. My only complaint would have to be the temperature of the restaurant. It was a little on the cold side but aside from that the entire experience has me eager to get back. Come on who goes out for restaurant week (29.95/person) and still spends $200. They drew us right in and it was wonderful.

She took our order then returned to make sure she had it right, then almost miss-poured the first round of wine pairings and consistently had trouble with the pronunciation and geographic regions of the wines. Toward the end we had a cheese plate that waited on the table for 5 minutes before we received plates. After dessert we waited a while for our server to take the coffee order and after that she took quite some time (about 15-20 minutes) to drop the check. Again, this may have just been an ""off"" night for her, but it seemed to snowball. The food was wonderful and the pairings were sound."

The beverage manager, Anter, is very interactive and helpful, and will make adjustment in pairings to accommodate different tastes.

All the staff was gracious and very professional. The food was memorable. I will let people know about our positive dining experience. The valet Tony did a nice job also.
June 13, 2008|Every detail was amazing -|5|Every detail was amazing - it was my sister's birthday, so they covered our table with little silver stars, gave her a special birthday menu, and started off our meal with a glass of sparkling wine. The lighting, decor, service and food were truly unforgetable - we were thrilled with the experience.
June 6, 2008|One of the more progressive|4|One of the more progressive restaurants in Providence, this was a real treat from start to finish. Lovely room, service, and food. Everyone there communicated a sincerity and enthusiasm for the food and overall experience that was completely infectious. Some dishes worked a little better than others, but this was part of the fun: Gracie's isn't content to stand still or rest on its laurels; rather, it seems in a constant state of playful experimentation, pushing its own envelope without ever treading into the overtly cerebral or weird. A noteworthy Providence destination through and through.
June 6, 2008|We had an AMAZING dining experience|5|We had an AMAZING dining experience at Gracie's. The staff was warm and friendly and the food absolutely fantastic. The chef came to our table near the end of our meal and we had an enjoyable conversation with him as well. We have found a new favorite restaurant. I would highly recommend Gracie's to anyone who enjoys fine dining.
May 31, 2008|I do not give out five star|5|I do not give out five star reviews lightly, but Gracie's earns it. The food is creative, fresh and delicious; but what really sets Gracie's apart is their attention to detail and unparalleled service. Treat yourself to a night at Gracie's (especially if it's a special occasion). It's not cheap, but you won't be disappointed.
May 29, 2008|Gracie's was outstanding in|5|"Gracie's was outstanding in every way! In addition to fabulous food, service and ambiance, the owner and staff of the restaurant provided amazing service in response to my request for ""a nice table and candle in a dessert"" to celebrate a very special birthday. ""Happy Birthday"" menus, complimentary champagne, stars on the table, and a private booth were graciously provided in addition to the fabulous food! A totally wonderful dining experience! Thank you, Gracie's!"

May 25, 2008|Gracie's 7 course Spring tasting|5|Gracie's 7 course Spring tasting menu was amazing overall, especially the gnocchi and the fois gras! We even set the date for our next group dinner on August 31st before leaving; the 7 course Summer tasting menu! Anter our server was stellar and knowledgeable about every item/wine he presented us with... hopefully the 6 of us will see him again in August!

We had the 7 course wine menu and everything was excellent, particularly the gnocchi with spring peas and the crispy skinned halibut with asparagus cream. A few too many white wines during the pairings for my tastes, but there were good ones. I'd go back in a snap.

May 16, 2008|Our food was almost faultless,|4|"Our food was almost faultless, but the rhythm of service was so off that it made the experience frustrating. We chose the five-course tasting menu without wine pairings because the wine by the glass list was nicely varied and we wanted to choose. Problem was, the rhythm was completely out of whack. We would order a glass of wine to go with a course, then finish it and be served the next course without ever being offered another glass of wine. We often sat over a lovely dish without anything at all to drink. And it was almost impossible to get anyone's attention to say ""hey, we'd love another glass."" I loved the food and yet wouldn't go back. That should tell you something. Please note, our service was absolutely congenial, just inept."
May 16, 2008|My husband and I spent approx.|3|"My husband and I spent approx. $250 for the 7-course chef dinner with wine pairing. The food and wine selection was excellent. However, we received horrible service from ""Mike"". The poor service (ordered cocktails and didn't see the waiter for another 20 minutes) and overall lack of attention, wine and food knowledge throughtout the entire meal was terrible. I consider $250 a large sum of money to spend on a meal. To spend that on a meal where you are aggravated for most of the meal is a waste."
May 16, 2008|This was the second time in|5|This was the second time in two months eating here prior to going to the theatre. A top pick as the food & very attentative service (from the Ks') made for another pleasant evening. My favorite in Providence.

May 10, 2008|Gracie's separates themselves|4|"Gracie's separates themselves from their competition with their emphasis on making your dining experience ""special to your evening celebration."" While doing so I felt that some attention to detail was missed such as drinks not arriving with the course and silverware not on the table when food arrived. I am pointing out very small flaws compared to the overall experience of dining at Gracie's on a special night for an AMAZING (food quality, presentation, TASTE, and service) meal made even more special by the positive attitude and noticeable teamwork of the entire staff. What a pleasurable night out in Providence and I will intensely recommend the restaurant to anyone dining in the area. Thank you."

April 20, 2008|One of the few restaurants|5|One of the few restaurants in Providence that offers a tasting menu. This was a complete surprise, but we did it anyway. Our primary server was passionate about the wine and food he serverd and he was backed up by a very attentive team. The chef was very creative and made some of the dishes based on our preferences. The food was exceptional and meticuolously presented. Although we did the seven course menu, yes seven courses, the desserts were just to die for -- and I'm not even a dessert person. This was a rewarding and memorable experience for us. The ambiance, wait staff, food and neighborhood location will bring us back many times!
April 18, 2008|We did the 7 course chef's|5|We did the 7 course chef's tasting menu, with wine pairings. Every course was fantastic- a wonderful progression of flavors, textures, colors. The wines chosen for each course complimented perfectly. The service was OUTSTANDING-- unobtrusive, but never absent, and very knowledgeable about the menu and wines. The whole experience was memorable.
Dined on April 17, 2008|Very, very disappointing food|2|Very, very disappointing food -- my soup was tepid, many flavors were off, the complimentary shot glass of gazpacho was so thick you couldn't drink it and no utensils were served with it, the only thing that was special at all was the venison loin but in general it was overpriced and underwhelming. We will not return.
April 13, 2008|We visited Gracie's after|4|We visited Gracie's after a Sunday matinee at Trinity Rep for the first time and were very happy with the whole experience. Menu items were unique, nicely varied, and delicious. One thing that quickly turns me off to a restaurant is finding items on the menu that you can fine at just about any restaurant, that was not the case here. Staff was extremely knowledge about each menu item, friendly and attentive. We look forward to our return visit and if consistent will bump this restaurant to Outstanding.
April 12, 2008|Excellent and rare find in|5|Excellent and rare find in Rhode Island. Up to par with any contemporary American cuisine found in most major cities (surpassing many). Inventive dishes with fresh ingredients, artfully presented with exceptional attention to detail. I would highly recommended to my friends and business associates.
April 12, 2008|Everything was great except|4|Everything was great except the tables are a little close for private conversations. Otherwise, a very nice experience. Food was very good and presented beautifully. Very convenient for theatre-goers. Would be nice if they would offer a small discount to folks with theatre tickets. But, not a necessity for us to go there . . .

We started going because we noticed they had valet parking, and that took care of our car wwhile we ate and were at the theater. We have continued going because the food is superb, the service is great, and we always enjoy ourselves there.

March 16, 2008|We accepted our waitress'|4|We accepted our waitress' suggestion to try the Chef's Tasting, & we were glad we did. We chose the 7 course tasting (there was also a 5-course tasting). We enjoyed 6 of the 7 courses (we found the Clams Casino to be rather bland, albeit full of clam meat). The chef's preparation of top-grade tuna was excellent, as was his awesome fois gras. The venison was very, very good. The final course, a dessert course, was the perfect ending. It was also a treat to see that the restaurant had a bottle of Robert Sinskey (Napa) wine available; it was delicious, of course. Had we enjoyed the clams more than we did, we would have rated the food as Outstanding. The service was very friendly and prompt; the waitstaff were numerous and knowledgeable.

August 3, 2007|Unfortunately, my recent trip|2|Unfortunately, my recent trip to Gacie's was very disappointing. Aside from the new confusing menu set up for pre-fix meals, which is not necessary and offers less value than their prior menu; the portions for the five course dinner were tiny, and the taste and presentation were, at best, cookie cutter. Clearly, something has changed here. The service was a bit slow and the pace of the dinner was a bit too slow. At the near $500.00 price for the dinner for four(without tip), I expect much, much more from a restaurant that I have enjoyed in the past. A note to the chef, stop cutting corners and portions or you may not make it through this lean time. Also, stop serving dessert that looks like it comes from Friday's on a bad night.
